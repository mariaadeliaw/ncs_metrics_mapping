TI  - On-site effects of Imperata burning by Indonesian smallholders: A bioeconomic model
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic burning of the vast Imperata grassland areas of Indonesia is thought to have a number of negative consequences, both on and off site. We assess on-site biophysical and economic consequences by adapting a bioeconomic model to conditions prevalent in the Indonesian uplands. Burning is shown to exacerbate soil degradation both directly through loss of soil nutrients and indirectly through erosion. Despite this, it is demonstrated that burning is the most profitable method of Imperata control in an upland 'shifting cultivation' system. Changing factor prices may alter this. A 25% reduction in herbicide prices would make herbicide use more attractive than burning. If off-site costs are considered, Imperata control with herbicide may be preferable to burning.Upland cropping within an Imperata fallow system is marginally profitable under prevailing economic and biophysical conditions. Abandonment of these upland areas by smallholders, or adoption of more productive farming systems, seems inevitable.

TI  - Reclaiming Tropical Saline-Sodic Soils with Gypsum and Cow Manure
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline-sodic soils are a major impediment for agricultural production in semi-arid regions. Salinity and sodicity drastically reduce agricultural crop yields, damage farm equipment, jeopardize food security, and render soils unusable for agriculture. However, many farmers in developing semi-arid regions cannot afford expensive amendments to reclaim saline-sodic soils. Furthermore, existing research does not cover soil types (e.g., Luvisols and Lixisols) that are found in many semi-arid regions of South America. Therefore, we used percolation columns to evaluate the effect of inexpensive chemical and organic amendments (gypsum and cow manure) on the reclamation of saline-sodic soils in the northeast of Brazil. Soil samples from two layers (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm in depth) were collected and placed in percolation columns. Then, we applied gypsum into the columns, with and without cow manure. The experiment followed a complete randomized design with three replications. The chemical amendment treatments included a control and four combinations of gypsum and cow manure. Percolation columns were subjected to a constant flood layer of 55 mm. We evaluated the effectiveness of sodic soil reclamation treatments via changes in soil hydraulic conductivity, chemical composition (cations and anions), electrical conductivity of the saturated soil-paste extract, pH, and the exchangeable sodium percentage. These results suggest that the combined use of gypsum and cow manure is better to reduce soil sodicity, improve soil chemical properties, and increase water infiltration than gypsum alone. Cow manure at 40 ton ha(-1) was better than at 80 ton ha(-1) to reduce the sodium adsorption ratio.

TI  - Influence of hydrological pathways on dissolved organic carbon fluxes in tropical streams
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water flow pathways and water balance are fundamental components for understanding the dynamics of C in the soil/water interface of small basins. The objective of this study was to describe the seasonal variations and estimate the annual balance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by comparing two tropical microbasins (preserved forest-PF and cacao plantation-CP). Twenty-one weekly collections were conducted from September to December 2012 and from April to June 2013. The calculation of the partial balance considered precipitation (P) as inflow and the stream as outflow. The samples were filtered and analyzed using a TOC analyzer. Overall, the DOC was higher CP compared with FP. The behavior of both venues showed that rainy season caused an increase in concentrations in the overland flow (OF) and in the stream, and a decrease in the precipitation (P) and in the throughfall (T). In the CP, the outflow and the soil were chiefly responsible for the high DOC concentrations in the stream, when compared to the PF, which is the result of constant OM decomposition. Soil composition contributes to the control of DOC consumption in each type of soil. The balances were negative in both microbasins, although losses were higher in the AFS (agroforestry systems) when compared to the PF, especially during rainy seasons (-8.98 and -3.05 kg ha(-1) year(-1), CP and FP, respectively). Thus, the high annual loss of DOC in the CP of the microbasins during the rainy season indicates changes in ecosystem metabolism due to the vegetation cover and to the interactions with the soil.

TI  - Growth, Biomass and Carbon Stocks in Forest Cover Planted in an Area of Bauxite Mining in Rehabilitation
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover in areas degraded by mining is an alternative way of mitigating CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere by fixing C in tree biomass. This study evaluated the growth and C stocks of forest cover in an area of bauxite mining with four sources of fertilizer. Height (Ht), diameter at ground level (DGL), and diameter at breast height (DBH) were determined in Anadenanthera peregrina (Ap), clonal Eucalyptus (Euc), and a mixed plantation of 16 native forest species (Nat) at 6, 18, 36, and 56 months of age. Trunk+bark volume, biomass, and C stock were also determined for these forest covers at 56 months of age. The fertilization treatments were a standard (SF) adopted by the company, SF plus organic fertilizer (OF), chemical fertilizer (CF), and OF+CF. Euc displayed greater values of Ht, DGL, and DBH under OF+CF and OF. Fertilization did not influence the Ht and DBH of Ap, but DGL was higher under OF+CF at 36 months compared to SF. The Ht values of Nat were influenced by fertilization at 18 months, with the lowest values under SF. The fertilization influenced the DGL of Nat at 36 and 56 months, which did not occur with DBH. The pioneer species had higher Ht, DGL, and DGB compared to non-pioneer species, regardless of the type of fertilization studied. Fertilization influenced the Ht and DGL of pioneer species at 18 and 36 months of age and only the Ht of non-pioneer species. The estimates of Euc biomass (255 Mg ha(-1)) and C stocks (120 Mg ha(-1)) under OF+OC were four times greater than in Ap and Nat, which showed no difference between themselves or the types of fertilization. The growth and estimates of volume, biomass, and C stocks of the forest cover were comparable to those of unmined areas. Euc had the greatest growth, biomass, and C stocks.

TI  - Women's participation and the gender perspective in sustainable forestry in Cambodia: local perceptions and the context of forestry research
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed local stakeholders' perceptions on women's engagement in sustainable forestry and the challenges women face. We additionally examined the publication of scientific papers on women's participation and gender perspectives in forestry research. We employed Kendall's W to examine the concordance of local peoples' assessment of the knowledge of rural women related to forestry, the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry and the tasks required to engage women better. The study revealed only very weak agreement regarding the knowledge of rural women about forestry (Kendall's W = 0.47, p < .000). Local people considered women knew most about sustainable forestry and use of forest for various purposes and less about the trees and forests. The study found moderate agreement (Kendall's W = .118, p < .000) concerning the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry, with the most significant barrier being low female participation in decision-making bodies. There was very weak agreement on the highest priority task required to engage women better in forestry management (Kendall's W = .035, p < .000). Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the scientific papers. From 1992 to September 2018, 537 scientific papers were published in 171 journals, with study sites in 83 countries, related to women and gender in 1) forest, 2) REDD + and 3) community-based forestry. The countries most covered by the research were: Indonesia (27 articles), India (39), United States (45) and Nepal (51). There was a significant increase in the number of papers on women's participation and gender mainstreaming in 1) forest (n = 482) and 2) community-based forestry (n = 20) from 2007, and in 3) REDD + discourses (n = 34) from 2011. This study suggests further scientific research is needed on women's participation and gender perspective in sustainable forestry and environmental concerns if the collective action needed for sustainable forest management is to be effectively addressed.

TI  - AGRONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF MELON PRODUCED IN THE BRAZILIAN SEMIARID REGION
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the agronomic and environmental performance of yellow melons produced in an experimental area in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, using conventional methods and alternative systems of cultivation based on the rotation of melons with green manure crops. Two types of alternative management systems were evaluated, spanning twelve treatments: i) tillage, with the incorporation of the green manure biomass into the soil via the subsequent planting of melons into that residue, and ii) no tillage, with the maintenance of the biomass on the soil surface with subsequent planting of melons. Agronomic performance was evaluated by statistical analysis of productivity, while environmental performance was evaluated by analyzing the carbon footprint, according to ISO 14067. Agronomic analysis showed that rotation of melons with maize and Brachiaria resulted in a higher yield of melons for export. Assessment of the carbon footprint of this system in relation to the conventional system showed that the rotation system presented a lower carbon footprint. A scenario analysis showed that the carbon footprint can be further reduced by 42.54%, if: i) production takes place in areas already cultivated for more than 20 years, ii) the amount of inorganic nitrogen applied is reduced by 50%, and iii) commercialization of melons begins in the United States. This study shows the importance of rotating melons with green manure crops to increase production in the semiarid region and reduce the carbon footprint of this fruit.

TI  - Soil carbon fluxes and balances of crop rotations under long-term no-till
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A field study with the same crop rotations was conducted to test the hypothesis that the soil Carbon fluxes and balances could vary according to the crop species and also mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. This study aimed to assess the CO(2)emission from crop rotations according to C and N inputs from crop residue, the influences on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TN) stocks, identifying the soybean production systems with positive C balance. Triticale (x Triticosecale) or sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are grown in the fall/winter; sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), or fallow are the spring treatments, and soybean as a main crop in summer. Results We found that high C inputs from crop residues modify the C dynamics in crop rotations by reducing the C output (CO2) and increasing C sequestration in the soil. In general, the higher SOC, C stocks, and TN in soil surface were due to higher C and N inputs from sunn hemp or forage sorghum crop residues in spring. These crops also produced lower accumulated CO(2)emissions and, when rotating with triticale in the fall-winter season resulted in a positive C balance, making these soybean crop rotations more efficient. Conclusion Our study suggests the ideal crop species choice in a rotation can mitigate the CO(2)emissions by increasing C and N input from crop residues and consequently SOC and C stocks. In particular, crop rotation comprises an important tool to achieve a positive C balance, mitigate CO(2)emissions and provide an additional ecosystem service to soybean cultivation option.

TI  - Agroforestry system improves soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in depth after land-use changes in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have the potential to increase soil organic matter, with effects on soil carbon and nitrogen contents, but information on the application of these systems in semi-arid regions is still scarce. This study aimed to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in the conversion of native forest from the Caatinga Biome into integrated agriculture systems in the Brazilian semi-arid region. We evaluated the following management systems in the Haplic Inceptisol (Cambissolo Haplico eutrofico): (1) Intercropping area, cultivated with corn and Massai grass; (2) Caatinga (natural vegetation); (3) AFS10: agroforestry system with native woody forest rows occupying 33 % and agriculture occupying 66 % of the total area; and (4) AFS20: agroforestry system presenting inverse proportions of AFS10. The agroforestry systems were intercropped with sorghum or millet, pigeon pea and Massai grass. We collected disturbed and undisturbed soil samples at the layers of 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.40, 0.40-0.60 and 0.60-1.00 m for analysis of carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), soil bulk density, and calculation of SOC and N stocks and C/N ratio, two years after the conversion of natural vegetation to the agricultural area (intercropping) and agroforestry system (AFS10 and AFS20). We applied principal component and cluster analysis to explore the data, and confidence interval to compare the means of accumulated SOC and N stocks up to 1 m soil depth. No differences exist for the properties analysed in superficial layers (0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m), regardless of land-use systems. AFS20 increase the SOC content and, consequently, SOC stock, in subsurface layers; on the other hand, intercropping increases N content and N stock. AFS20 presented higher accumulated SOC stocks up to 1.00 m (114.97 Mg ha-1). Agroforestry systems management is an alternative for increasing carbon sequestration under the conversion from Caatinga to agricultural areas.

TI  - Impact of cropping methods on biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 x 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs-readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

TI  - Common bean in highly variable weather conditions, on sandy soils, and food security in a subtropical environment
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Common bean is a vital component of food security and reduction in malnutrition in developing nations of the world. In a year of low rainfall and high temperature during flowering and high rainfall during grain filling, we studied the effects of (1) water availability and tillage on soil structural formation and on water retention, growth and productivity of common bean, and (2) time series analysis of soil available water and its relationship with related atmospheric variables. Soil management systems consisted of no-tillage (NT), conventional tillage (CT), chiseling 2 days before sowing (Ch 0), and 1 year before sowing (Ch 1), in complete randomized block design and four replications. Air temperature, rainfall, soil available water, and air capacity were monitored throughout the 78-days bean cycle, and time series analysis of data was performed. Water availability in topsoil reached limiting values, close to the permanent wilting point, limiting proper development of bean at flowering. Water availability was higher in periods of limited rainfall in untilled soils (NT and Ch 1). Low soil availability of water and high air temperatures during flowering and grain filling stages affected grain production but grain yield did not differ statistically among tillage systems, which was similar to the average yield obtained in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Temporal distribution of soil available water did not correlate with daily rainfall but correlated with air temperature. Time series analysis was adequate for estimating soil available water from its previous and related variables. Conservation agriculture (no-tillage and old-chiseling) improves water conditions in soil, but with long periods of water deficit there is no guarantee for high food production; thus, supplementary irrigation may still be necessary to reduce the combined effects of abiotic factors of air temperature and rainfall.

TI  - Soil C stocks in latossolos of the planalto, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - : Approximately 5% of the total emissions (0.11 Gt CO2 2 and GWP-AR5) originate in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), a representative agricultural region in Southern Brazil. This study assessed SOCS (soil organic C stocks) in Latossolos of the Planalto of RS, with up-to-date data obtained from recent field campaigns and legacy data, and relate these SOC stocks to environmental variables. A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1 ) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1 ). The highest stocks (237 +/- 39 Mg ha-1 ) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distrof & eacute;rrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distr & oacute;fico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies. We concluded that, despite significant land use changes, soils of this region maintain large SOCS which had been underestimated in previous studies.

TI  - Disentangling how management affects biomass stock and productivity of tropical secondary forests fallows
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of biomass production in secondary forests after cultivation is essential for assessing the resilience of slash and burn systems and their capacity to deliver ecosystem services. Biomass production is influenced by management legacies, landscape configuration and soil, but these drivers are rarely studied simultaneously, nor is the role of changes in vegetation properties in linking them to biomass production. We assessed how management legacies affect biomass in secondary forests created by slash and burn in the central Congo Basin, and tested whether changes in productivity could be attributed to changes in stem density, functional diversity, functional identity or soil. Using data from 6452 trees in 96 fallow plots nested in 3 study sites, we looked for the main determinants of aboveground biomass (AGB) of woody vegetation in fallow systems. Next, using a subset of 58 plots in fallow fields aged 5 to 10 years, we used confirmatory path analysis to explore the relations between management history, soil, vegetation properties and biomass productivity. The sampled fallow fields had, on average, 58.4(+/- 46.2) Mg ha(-1) AGB. AGB was positively related to both fallow age and to the proportion of remnant trees in AGB and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles. Biomass productivity varied with the number of previous slash-and-burn cycles, with notable declines in the fourth cycle. The effect of management history was mainly through a reduction in the dominance of fast growing tree species and in the number of regenerating stems, which were also indirectly affected by an increase in C. odorata cover. Soil fertility status and the biomass of remnant trees also modified biomass productivity. Our findings suggest that under the current management intensity the capacity of the slash and burn system to provide important ecosystem functions, such as carbon sequestration, is declining.

TI  - A new in-field indicator to assess the impact of land management on soil carbon dynamics
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of the impacts of land-use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics is a major environmental concern, as the soil carbon cycle underpins key ecosystem services. However, assessments based on short-term SOC dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties. Hurisso et al. (2016) proposed a method to assess SOC dynamics by coupling two methods: Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC) and Basal Soil Respiration (BSR). This method has been used in laboratory on dried and re-wetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly. In our study, we adapted this method to the field and proposed a cost-effective in-field indicator combining the POXC and in situ Basal Soil Respiration (SituResp (R) method).We tested the indicator at four study sites (n = 169 points) within various tropical land-use and management contexts based on rubber, soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The results demonstrated the relevance, sensitivity and robustness of the POXC-SituResp (R) indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on SOC dynamics. The results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture (no-tillage and crops residues) and compost amendments to accumulate SOC. Rock-Eval (R) analysis showed that POXC-SituResp (R) indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon. Carbon pools targeted by the POXC were specified by Rock-Eval (R) pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of SOC.Our study confirms that the integrated indicator based on POXC and BSR assess a relative carbon stabilization of SOC pools. This indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and cost-effective method.

TI  - Throughfall reduction in a cacao agroforest: tree water use and soil water budgeting
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a cacao agroforest with Gliricidia shade trees we studied the effects of experimentally reduced throughfall on tree sap flux densities and soil water budget. The objectives of our study were: (1) to identify the response of cacao and Gliricidia sap flux densities to reduced soil water availability, and (2) to analyze the changes in stand level soil water partitioning, measured as changes in transpiration, drainage and soil moisture storage under reduced throughfall. The study was conducted in Sulawesi, Indonesia at a site where ambient precipitation was 2841 mm yr(-1). The research site was subdivided into three control plots and three plastic roof plots in which net precipitation was reduced by 71% through the use of a sub-canopy roof for 13 months, to create rainfall conditions similar to an extended El Nino event. The two species differed in their sap flux response to declining soil water content. Daily Gliricidia sap flux declined at higher soil water contents than cacao, while Gliricidia sap flux declined in response to all levels of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and cacao only responded to high levels of VPD. Average monthly sap flux densities of cacao and Gliricidia in the roof plots decreased linearly with decreasing soil water content reaching a maximum reduction of 21% (cacao) and 29% (Gliricidia) as compared to control plots. Cacao withdrew water mainly from the topsoil where small amounts of throughfall entering gaps in the roof frequently rewetted the soil. Therefore the competition between the two species for water resources during long periods with only little precipitation was low or in favor of cacao. Average daily stand transpiration was 1.3 mm in roof plots and 1.5 mm in control plots. Measured soil water contents were simulated satisfactorily by the application of a one-dimensional soil water model based on Richards unsaturated flow equation. The model suggested that drainage amounted to 1554 mm yr(-1) in control plots. Drainage in roof plots was greatly reduced, totaling 299 mm yr(-1). Soil moisture storage in the control underwent minor variations while it was heavily reduced in roof plots. Drainage in roof plots was a large driver of changes in soil moisture storage especially in deeper soil layers while precipitation and root water uptake were the main influencing factors for the topsoil. Deep root water uptake seemed to play a minor role in this experiment. Despite the strong reduction in net precipitation, declines in stand transpiration were moderate, suggesting that the stand did not react sensitively to the reduced throughfall scenario.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from sugar cane ethanol: Estimate considering current different production scenarios in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The studies of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of sugarcane ethanol production show few scenarios or, in most cases, a single representative scenario of the most common practices for ethanol production. However, the combination of the diverse sugarcane agricultural and industrialization practices lead to a wide variety of production scenarios. Current studies do not show the GHG emissions balance for all these scenarios. This issue is the aim of this study, which presents a GHG emissions balance of ethanol production considering 120 different scenarios related to current sugarcane agricultural and industrial practices in Brazil, with data of Minas Gerais. In order to obtain the ethanol production scenarios, different types of cultivation, fertilization, harvesting and different sugarcane crop cycles were combined. The scenarios were classified by groups, according to their GHG emission levels. The main characteristics of each group were analyzed in order to identify the factors that influence the performance of GHG emissions. The results show GHG emission levels ranging from 2489.38 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1).yr(-1) to 3289.95 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1).yr(-1), depending on the regime of agricultural practices present in each scenario. The factors that most favor the increase of GHG emission levels are: short sugarcane crop cycle combined with fertigation with stillage. These two factors were present in production scenarios that presented the highest levels of GHG emissions in this study. The factors that most favor the decrease of GHG emissions are: long sugarcane crop cycle, fertilization without stillage on ratoon and mechanical harvesting without sugarcane burning. All these factors were present in scenarios that presented the lowest GHG emissions. On the other hand, in certain agricultural conditions, the mechanical harvesting of green cane showed to be as polluting as manual harvesting of burnt cane. The differences between the types of cultivation showed no significant influence on the final balance of GHG emissions.

TI  - Impact of drought associated with high temperatures on Coffea canephora plantations: a case study in Espirito Santo State, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are major natural disasters that affect many parts of the world all years and recently affected one of the major conilon coffee-producing regions of the world in state of Espirito Santo, which caused a huge crisis in the sector. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct an analysis with technical-scientific basis of the real impact of drought associated with high temperatures and irradiances on the conilon coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex Froehner) plantations located in the north, northwest, and northeast regions of the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Data from 2010 to 2016 of rainfall, air temperature, production, yield, planted area and surface remote sensing were obtained from different sources, statistically analyzed, and correlated. The 2015/2016 season was the most affected by the drought and high temperatures (mean annual above 26 degrees C) because, in addition to the adverse weather conditions, coffee plants were already damaged by the climatic conditions of the previous season. The increase in air temperature has higher impact (negative) on production than the decrease in annual precipitation. The average annual air temperatures in the two harvest seasons that stood out for the lowest yields (i.e. 2012/2013 and 2015/2016) were approximately 1 degrees C higher than in the previous seasons. In addition, in the 2015/2016 season, the average annual air temperature was the highest in the entire series. The spatial and temporal distribution of Enhanced Vegetation Index values enabled the detection and perception of droughts in the conilon coffee-producing regions of Espirito Santo. The rainfall volume accumulated in the periods from September to December and from April to August are the ones that most affect coffee yield. The conilon coffee plantations in these regions are susceptible to new climate extremes, as they continue to be managed under irrigation and full sun. The adoption of agroforestry systems and construction of small reservoirs can be useful to alleviate these climate effects, reducing the risk of coffee production losses and contributing to the sustainability of crops in Espirito Santo.

TI  - A simplified modelling approach for quantifying tillage effects on soil carbon stocks
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil tillage has been shown to affect long-term changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content in a number of field experiments. This paper presents a simplified approach for including effects of tillage in models of soil C turnover in the tilled-soil layer. We used an existing soil organic matter (SOM) model (CN-SIM) with standard SOC data for a homogeneous tilled layer from four long-term field experiments with conventionally tilled (CT) and no-till (NT) treatments. The SOM model was tested on data from long-term (> 10 years) field trials differing in climatic conditions, soil properties, residue management and crop rotations in Australia, Brazil, the USA and Switzerland. The C input for the treatments was estimated using data on crop rotation and residue management. The SOM model was applied for both CT and NT trials without recalibration, but incorporated a 'tillage factor' (TF) to scale all decomposition and maintenance parameters in the model. An initial value of TF = 0.57 (parameter uncertainty, PU = 0.15) for NT (with TF set to 1.0 for CT) was used on the basis of a previous study with observations of soil CO(2) respiration. The simulated and observed changes in SOC were then compared using slopes of linear regressions of SOC changes over time. Results showed that the SOM model captured observed changes in SOC content from differences in rotations, N application and crop residue management for conventional tillage. On the basis of SOC change data a mean TF of 0.48 (standard deviation, SD = 0.12) was estimated for NT. The results indicate that (i) the estimated uncertainty of tillage effects on SOC turnover may be smaller than previously thought and (ii) simple scaling of SOM model parameters may be sufficient to capture the effects of soil tillage on SOM turnover in the tilled layer. Scenario analyses showed that the average extra C input needed to compensate for soil tillage was 762 (SD = 351) kg C ha-1 year-1. Climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) also affected how much extra C was needed, with substantially larger inputs being required for wetter and warmer climates.

TI  - Will Passive Protection Save Congo Forests?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Africa's tropical forests are among the world's largest carbon reserves. Historically, they have experienced low rates of deforestation. Pressures to clear land are increasing due to development of infrastructure and livelihoods, foreign investment in agriculture, and shifting land use management, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC contains the greatest area of intact African forests. These store approximately 22 billion tons of carbon in aboveground live biomass, yet only 10% are protected. Can the status quo of passive protection-forest management that is low or nonexistent-ensure the preservation of this forest and its carbon? We have developed the SimCongo model to simulate changes in land cover and land use based on theorized policy scenarios from 2010 to 2050. Three scenarios were examined: the first (Historical Trends) assumes passive forest protection; the next (Conservation) posits active protection of forests and activation of the national REDD+ action plan, and the last (Agricultural Development) assumes increased agricultural activities in forested land with concomitant increased deforestation. SimCongo is a cellular automata model based on Bayesian statistical methods tailored for the DRC, built with the Dinamica-EGO platform. The model is parameterized and validated with deforestation observations from the past and runs the scenarios from 2010 through 2050 with a yearly time step. We estimate the Historical Trends trajectory will result in average emissions of 139 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s, a 15% increase over current emissions. The Conservation scenario would result in 58% less clearing than Historical Trends and would conserve carbon-dense forest and woodland savanna areas. The Agricultural Development scenario leads to emissions of 212 million t CO2 year(-1) by the 2040s. These scenarios are heuristic examples of policy's influence on forest conservation and carbon storage. Our results suggest that 1) passive protection of the DRC's forest and woodland savanna is insufficient to reduce deforestation; and 2): enactment of a REDD+ plan or similar conservation measure is needed to actively protect Congo forests, their unique ecology, and their important role in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Diversified crop rotations increase the yield and economic efficiency of grain production systems
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotations with high plant diversity and biomass input have been recognized worldwide as a crucial practice for increasing the sustainability of grain production systems, particularly in regions under no-tillage (NT) management. Nonetheless, low-diversity grain production systems based on double cropping (two crops in the same agricultural year) repeated over time, including soybean followed by maize (known in Brazil as "second crop maize ") or wheat, remain prevalent in Brazil. The continuous use of these systems can impair soil yield capacity, farmers' profits, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the grain yield and profitability of different production systems with different levels of plant diversity. This study was based on results obtained during the 2009-2017 cropping seasons through a long-term field trial conducted under NT since 1985 in southern Brazil. The trial covered two 4-year agricultural cycles with two crops per year, resulting in eight crops per cycle and 16 crops over the entire period. The experiment followed a randomized complete block design, with five treatments and four replicates. The treatments involved three diversified crop rotations, comprising different cover crops and two double-crop systems (wheat-soybean and maize-soybean). For a given agricultural year, wheat and cover crops (white oats, black oats, and forage radish) were grown from May to September, and the second crop maize was grown from March to August. Soybean and first crop maize were grown during the summer from October to February. The grain yield, gross revenue, production cost, and cumulative profit were analyzed for each production system. Gross revenue and profit were primarily estimated based on the actual annual average commodity prices received by farmers, and two additional price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) were proposed considering the average prices from 2010 to 2017. Regardless of the cropping season, first crop maize and wheat grain yields were higher in diversified crop rotations. The production system only affected the second crop maize yield in 2010/2011, with a higher value obtained in a diversified crop rotation system. The soybean yield in diversified crop rotations was higher than that in double crop systems. Considering each cash crop separately, soybean produced the highest average profit (US$ 472.50 ha(-1)), followed by the first crop maize (US$ 245.31 ha(-1)) and wheat (US$ 77.71 ha(-1)), whereas the second crop maize led to economic losses (-US$ 121.73 ha(-1)). All diversified crop rotations produced a higher 8-year cumulative profit and gross margin than the maize-soybean in double-crop system. The relative economic performance of production systems remained unchanged under alternative price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) compared with that under the observed (actual) price scenario. However, the cumulative profit of maize and soybean in double-crop system was the most negatively impacted in the pessimistic scenario (-45.9%), indicating greater economic risk. Overall, lack of direct revenues from cover crops were compensated by increased grain yield in the spring-summer season and profitability of diversified crop rotation systems. Therefore, diversified crop rotation systems are economically competitive with double crop systems, rendering them feasible management options for conserving natural resources and increasing crop resilience to adverse climatic conditions.

TI  - Effects of recent fire on soil conditions and nutrient use of a native and an invasive grass in the Brazilian savanna
T2  - ECOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In fire-influenced savanna ecosystems, native and invasive exotic plants may use different abilities to coexist and compete for nutrients available in post-fire soil. The availability and uptake of nitrate by two C4 grasses (Urochloa brizantha (exotic invasive) and Axonopus siccus (native)) were characterized in an unburned area and in a recently burned area in the Cerrado of Southeastern Brazil. Ecophysiologic tests were performed to measure Nitrate Reductase Activity (NRA) and nitrate content in leaves and roots. Soil fertility was also analyzed. In the unburned area, organic matter (25.32.4 g kg(-1)), phosphorus (19.0 +/- 2.0 mg dm(-3)), and nitrate (19.9 +/- 7.4 mg dm(-3)) levels were higher than in the recently burned area, which had 27% less cations in the soil. In comparison with soils from the recently burned and unburned areas, ashes of the recently burned area had higher pH, electrical conductivity and nitrate, potassium, and calcium contents. In both areas, the aboveground part of U. brizantha was more responsive to nitrate compared to A. siccus and both had low belowground NRA. This confirms the working hypothesis that the two species undergo distinct ecophysiologic processes and indicate the adaptive potential of U. brizantha to bypass soil nutrient limitation

AB  - Integrated Systems (IS) have been identified as an efficient land-management strategy for restoring degraded areas worldwide, increasing crops and beef yields and providing technical potential for carbon (C) sequestration in soil and trees as an option for offsetting CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle production. The aim of our study is to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and the C footprint of beef cattle (fattening cycle) in three contrasting production scenarios on the Brachiaria pasture in Brazil-1) degraded pasture (DP), 2) managed pasture (MP), and 3) the crop-livestock-forest integrated system (CLFIS) presenting new alternatives of land use as a GHG mitigation strategy. Area-scaled total GHG emissions were highest in MP (84,541 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)), followed by CLFIS (64,519 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)) and DP (8004 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)) over a 10-yr period. Our results note that the highest C footprint of beef cattle was in the DP, 18.5 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW (live weight), followed by 12.6 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the CLFIS and 9.4 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the MP, without taking into account the technical potential for C sequestration in MP (soil C) and CLFIS (soil and Eucalyptus C). Considering the potential for soil C sequestration in the MP and CLFIS, the C footprint of beef cattle could be reduced to 7.6 and -28.1 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the MP and CLFIS, respectively. The conversion of the degraded pasture to a well-managed pasture and the introduction of CLFIS can reduce their associated GHG emissions in terms of kg CO(2)eq emitted per kg of cattle LW produced, increasing the production of meat, grains and timber. This reduction is primarily due to pasture improvement and increases in cattle yields and the provision of technical potential for C sinks in soil and biomass to offset cattle-related emissions.

TI  - Indigenous governance and relationality have effectively avoided forest loss in the Southwest Amazon
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced geospatial analyses have underscored the effectiveness of Indigenous territories in avoiding deforestation, particularly across the tropics. However, the factors that shape such avoidance and their social-ecological contexts are still poorly understood. By using matching methods coupled with community-based and ethnographic approaches, we offer a contextual measure and understanding of deforestation avoidance of Indigenous territories in Southwestern Amazonia. Our counterfactual analysis of 19 Apurin & atilde; territories in Brazil over a 20-year period (2001-2021) in different municipalities showed that, even if Indigenous territories are by no means immune to forest loss, they have avoided significant levels of deforestation. Their effectiveness in mitigating deforestation is largely associated with distinct land-based governance, resilient leadership, as well as temporal perspectives and socio-bioeconomies inclusive to more-than-human beings.

TI  - How do soil resources affect herbivory in tropical plants along environmental gradients? A test using contrasting congeneric species
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plants adapted to different habitats exhibit differences in functional traits and these characteristics are influenced by soil properties. We tested the hypothesis that soil resource availability influences the functional traits of plants, affecting therefore herbivory levels. We examined three Byrsonima plant species with different life forms that occurred across a distinct edaphic habitat along the Doce River Basin, South-eastern Brazil. We characterized habitats according to soil nutrient concentration and measured functional characteristics of crown architecture, leaf nutrients, sclerophylly, leaf area and leaf density. In addition, we evaluated how these variables influenced herbivory levels of congeneric plants. Our data show that species along a gradient of soil nutrients have functional characteristics influenced by habitat, which in turn affect herbivory levels. By comparing congeners with different life forms found along a stress-gradient of continuous habitats, we describe a corresponding gradient of plant functional traits and tissue consumption by herbivorous insects.

TI  - Isolation by distance, not rivers, control the distribution of termite species in the Amazonian rain forest
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of species is affected by dispersal barriers, local environmental conditions and climate. However, the effect of species dispersal and their adaptation to the environment across geographic scales is poorly understood. To investigate the distribution of species from local to broad geographic scales, we sampled termites in 198 transects distributed in 13 sampling grids in the Brazilian Amazonian forest. The sampling grids encompassed an area of 271 500 km(2) and included the five major biogeographic regions delimited by Amazonian rivers. Environmental data for each transect were obtained from local measurements and remote sensing. Similar to previous studies, termite species composition at the local scale was mostly associated with measures of soil texture and chemistry. In contrast, termite species composition at broad geographic scales was associated with soil nutrients, and the geographic position of the transects. Between 17 and 30% of the variance in termite species composition could be attributed exclusively to the geographic position of the transects, but could not be attributed to measured environmental variables or the presence of major rivers. Isolation by distance may have strong effects on termite species composition due to historic processes and the spatially structured environments along distinct geological formations of Amazonia. However, in contrast to many taxa in Amazonia, there is no evidence that major rivers are important barriers to termite dispersal.

TI  - Chemical characteristics of soil organic matter from integrated agricultural systems in southeastern Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an essential role in agronomic systems and is of great importance to environmental sustainability and carbon sequestration. This study evaluates the accumulation of carbon in soils from integrated agricultural systems (S) that include crop (C), livestock (L), and forest (F) components (in different combinations: CLFS, LFS and CLS) and an undisturbed native forest (NF) as a reference area. The study sites are part of the Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste research station located in the southeast of Brazil in a region of dystrophic Red-Yellow Latosol soils. Stable carbon isotopic analysis (delta C-13) and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate the chemical characteristics of humic acid (HA) extracts of soils from different soil horizons. The findings were discussed in the context of laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) measurements on the whole soils and carbon content on both the whole soils and HA extracts. With increasing depth of the soil horizons, bulk SOM (in the whole soil) and a more recalcitrant humic fraction (the HA) became enriched in carbon, indicative of accumulation. Isotopic analysis revealed that SOM in the crop-livestock-forest system exhibited delta C-13 signatures corresponding to C4 plants (grass and corn). The native forest exhibited a uniform delta C-13 signature characteristic of C3 plants (native trees). Benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCA) quantification on limited samples revealed condensed aromatic structures in both crop-livestock-forest system and native forest. The absence of burning suggests that these compounds come from the humification of lignin. Based on structural characterization, carbon is sequestered as recalcitrant and long-lived oxidized ligninaceous structures and condensed aromatic groups. The current research demonstrates the feasibility of novel agricultural approaches such as using crop-livestock-forest systems. Such pastureland management enhances higher agricultural productivity and sustainability, thus avoiding new deforestation of native areas. Highlights Integrated agricultural systems enhance carbon enrichment in soil organic matter and humic acids. Carbon stabilized in oxidized ligninaceous and condensed molecules promotes long-term carbon storage. Extended root systems are likely to play a critical role in carbon sequestration. Integrated agricultural systems can be effective alternatives for reducing greenhouse gases.HighlightsIntegrated agricultural systems enhance carbon enrichment in soil organic matter and humic acids.Carbon stabilized in oxidized ligninaceous and condensed molecules promotes long-term carbon storage.Extended root systems are likely to play a critical role in carbon sequestration.Integrated agricultural systems can be effective alternatives for reducing greenhouse gases.

TI  - Adapting smartphone app used in water testing, for soil nutrient analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Smartphone technology has now penetrated every aspect of modern life. At such high rates of access and utilization, there is today much potential for the development of smartphones as high-performing tools in a number of industries. Traditionally, smartphones have been used as e.g. point-of-care testing devices in developing countries; now a similar approach can be extended to agriculture. This paper assesses the viability of utilizing smartphones in soil analysis. An Android-based smartphone application, in conjunction with commercially available Quantofix (R) test strips, was employed to analyze 92 soil samples collected across Indonesia. The soils tested encompassed a wide range of different textures (with 13%, 60% and 25% of samples constituting sandy, loamy and clayey soils, respectively), soil organic matter contents (range: 0.8-19.7%) and nutrient concentrations (range for plant-available N: 0.1-137.4 mg kg(-1) and P: 1.2 to 64.2 mg kg(-1); on dry soil basis). The app utilizes the smartphone as a portable reflectometer, which relates the color of test strips to the concentration of particular nutrients present in the soil medium. Three mobile devices currently available on the market, representing low, mid- and high-end products, were used to test the application. The results obtained via the smartphone were compared against standard methods for determination of extractable nitrate-N and exchangeable phosphorus (Olsen-P) under laboratory conditions. The smartphone-mediated soil analysis was found to have a high degree of agreement with standard methods for nitrate-N determination (87% of samples with nitrate-N differed by less than 10 mg kg(-1) from the standard method for the high-end smartphone) but not for phosphorus determination where chemical interferences to test strip colour development were noted. All three mobile devices were shown to be effective as portable reflectometers. However, color perception was found to differ amongst the devices, resulting in a consistent bias between the high-end phone and the remaining appliances. Whereas, it is essential to consider the inter-smartphone variability in readings and environmental factors such as temperature prior to the smartphone-mediated soil analysis, the smartphone-test strip combination might be employed as acceptable screening tool for soil nutrient concentration assessment to enhance crop outcomes, increasing yield, and preventing over-application of inputs, reducing consequent financial and environmental impact. Further enhancements can test the applicability of smartphone-mediated soil analysis in field conditions.

TI  - Singapore's willingness to pay for mitigation of transboundary forest-fire haze from Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze pollution over the past four decades in Southeast Asia is mainly a result of forest and peatland fires in Indonesia. The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration. We recommend that our results be incorporated into future cost-benefit analyses of the fires and mitigation strategies.

TI  - CH4 and N2O emissions from smallholder agricultural systems on tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are limited data for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from smallholder agricultural systems in tropical peatlands, with data for non-CO2 emissions from human-influenced tropical peatlands particularly scarce. The aim of this study was to quantify soil CH4 and N2O fluxes from smallholder agricultural systems on tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia and assess their environmental controls. The study was carried out in four regions in Malaysia and Indonesia. CH4 and N2O fluxes and environmental parameters were measured in cropland, oil palm plantation, tree plantation and forest. Annual CH4 emissions (in kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1)) were: 70.7 +/- 29.5, 2.1 +/- 1.2, 2.1 +/- 0.6 and 6.2 +/- 1.9 at the forest, tree plantation, oil palm and cropland land-use classes, respectively. Annual N2O emissions (in kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1)) were: 6.5 +/- 2.8, 3.2 +/- 1.2, 21.9 +/- 11.4 and 33.6 +/- 7.3 in the same order as above, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were strongly determined by water table depth (WTD) and increased exponentially when annual WTD was above -25 cm. In contrast, annual N2O emissions were strongly correlated with mean total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in soil water, following a sigmoidal relationship, up to an apparent threshold of 10 mg N L-1 beyond which TDN seemingly ceased to be limiting for N2O production. The new emissions data for CH4 and N2O presented here should help to develop more robust country level 'emission factors' for the quantification of national GHG inventory reporting. The impact of TDN on N2O emissions suggests that soil nutrient status strongly impacts emissions, and therefore, policies which reduce N-fertilisation inputs might contribute to emissions mitigation from agricultural peat landscapes. However, the most important policy intervention for reducing emissions is one that reduces the conversion of peat swamp forest to agriculture on peatlands in the first place.

TI  - Self-shading effect in the growth, photosynthesis and anatomy of Typha domingensis Pers.
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Typha domingensis Pers. (Typhaceae) is found growing naturally at high and low population densities in wetlands and shows remarkable invasive potential worldwide. The objective of this study was to verify the occurrence of changes in the environmental characteristics as well as in the biometry, anatomy, photosynthesis, and nutrient uptake of T. domingensis from natural populations growing at different densities. Plants were sampled from two populations exhibiting high and low densities and were further submitted to biometric, anatomical and physiological analyses. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and 15 replicates. Data were submitted to ANOVA and the Scott-Knott test (P <= 0.05). At a high population density, T. domingensis showed close plant spacing, a high number of plants and a large leaf area. In addition, high-density conditions promoted self-shading of the middle and lower parts of the shoots and led to increased whole plant photosynthesis. Soil nutrients were reduced under high-density conditions. In addition, plants from high-density population developed adaptations in their vascular tissues and aerenchyma. Therefore, the high-density population condition of T. domingensis causes and increased vegetative growth of these populations, as well as its invasive potential, may be related to mild self-shading, which promotes a large leaf area and high rate of photosynthesis.

TI  - Defining national biogenic methane targets: Implications for national food production & climate neutrality objectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas (GHG) modelled distinctly from long-lived GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide to establish global emission budgets for climate stabilisation. The Paris Agreement requires a 24-47% reduction in global biogenic methane emissions by 2050. Separate treatment of methane in national climate policies will necessitate consideration of how global emission budgets compatible with climate stabilisation can be downscaled to national targets, but implications of different downscaling rules for national food production and climate neutrality objectives are poorly understood. This study addresses that knowledge gap by examining four methods to determine national methane quotas, and two methods of GHG aggregation (GWP100 and GWP*) across four countries with contrasting agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors and socio-economic contexts (Brazil, France, India and Ireland). Implications for production of methane-intensive food (milk, meat, eggs and rice) in 2050 and national AFOLU climate neutrality targets are explored. It is assumed that methane quotas are always filled by food production where sufficient land is available. Global methane budgets for 1.5 degrees C scenarios are downscaled to national quotas based on: grand-parenting (equal percentage reductions across countries); equity (equal per capita emissions); ability (emission reductions proportionate to GDP); animal protein security (emissions proportionate to animal protein production in 2010). The choice of allocation method changes national methane quotas by a factor of between 1.7 (India) and 6.7 (Ireland). Despite projected reductions in emission-intensities, livestock production would need to decrease across all countries except India to comply with quotas under all but the most optimistic sustainable intensification scenarios. The extent of potential afforestation on land spared from livestock production is decisive in achieving climate neutrality. Brazil and Ireland could maintain some degree of milk and beef export whilst achieving territorial climate neutrality, but scenarios that comply with climate neutrality in India produce only circa 30% of national calorie and protein requirements via rice and livestock. The downscaling of global methane budgets into national policy targets in an equitable and internationally acceptable manner will require simultaneous consideration of the interconnected priorities of food security and (land banks available for) carbon offsetting.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of soil quality around mature oil palms receiving mineral fertilization
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is grown on a total area of 16 million ha; but data on soil quality in mature oil palm plantations are fragmentary and data concerning biota are almost nonexistent. Consequently, no well-tested sampling method is available for soil diagnoses. We studied the spatial heterogeneity of the soil around the palm by measuring comprehensive soil quality in a 24-year-old oil palm plantation. Soil quality and litter were assessed in five zones with different plant cover, and different applications of herbicide or fertilizer. Physical-chemical characteristics, macrofauna, and nematofauna were analysed. A sampling method was developed and adapted to the way the cultivation practices are implemented: sampling by zone and weighting the plot mean by the respective area of each zone. The total density of macrofauna in the litter and in the 0-15 cm soil layer followed a gradient from the harvest pathway (29 ind m(-2)) to the windrow (1003 ind m(-2)). Ants (13-237 ind m(-2)), earthworms (11-120 ind m(-2)), Dermaptera (0-35 ind m(-2)), Coleoptera (3-24 ind m(-2)) and Chilopoda (0-43 ind m(-2)) were the main taxa. The termite population was very poor (3-4 ind m(-2)). The density of nematofauna was also heterogeneous (268-805 ind 100 g(-1) of soil). Heterogeneity between zones was also reflected in the density of the functional groups, mainly soil engineers, detritivores and predators for macrofauna and bacterial feeders, and phytoparasites for nematofauna. The weeded circular zone around the palm had the highest soil nutrient content (P, K, Ca, Mg, C-org CEC, base saturation). Its biodiversity was average but it contained the highest density of earthworms and nematofauna. Possible relationships between chemicals and biological groups in the food web are discussed.

TI  - Environmental filters structure plant communities in the Brazilian Chaco
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterized taxonomic and functional differences between two vegetation physiognomies in the Brazilian Chaco, namely chaco woodland (CW) and chaco forest (CF), in order to understand which abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlie the establishment of different physiognomies. We characterized the vegetation physiognomies by comparing woody species composition, richness and diversity and functional diversity between CW and CF plots. We also measured soil variables to characterize abiotic factors related to the different physiognomies. Species richness and diversity and soil nutrient values were higher in CF. Leaf succulence and nitrogen content were higher in CW, while height, leaf area, and specific leaf area were higher in CF. The standardized effect size (S ES) of functional richness was higher in CW, but the SES of functional dispersion did not differ between CF and CW. We observed a diversity gradient related to soil fertility. Traits of species in CW were related to adaptations to poor soils, while in CF floristic composition showed a prevalence of species with more attributes related to competition for light. Thus, the structure of the floristic community in CW is likely related to an environmental filter, while competition for resources prevails in CF.

AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of the no-tillage system on soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and carbon stocks in Plinthic subgroups and Oxisols, located in Pontes and Lacerda, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The treatments were native vegetation and no-tillage systems established for 3, 8, 10, and 12 years. To analyse soil organic carbon, soils were sampled in each area, with three repetitions, at layers of 0-0.05; 0.05-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60-1.00; 1.00-1.50 and 1.50-2.00 m. For soil bulk density, undisturbed samples were collected at layers of 0-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m. Compared with areas of native vegetation, soil bulk density values after 12 years increased by 25% in Oxisols and 30% in the Plinthic subgroups. In Oxisols and Plinthic subgroups, respectively, organic carbon concentration was, on average, 20.57, 25.04 g kg-1 under native vegetation; 16.82, 16.59 g kg-1 after 3 years of no-tillage; 13.31, 4.96 g kg-1 after 8 years; 16.52, 14.39 g kg-1 after 10 years; and 17.97, 18.53 g kg-1 after 12 years. In both soils, the no-tillage system contributed to an increase in carbon stocks over the years, but not at depth, being generally limited to the top 0.20 m of the soils. Compared to native vegetation, after 12 years of no-tillage, carbon stocks decreased at a rate of 0.075 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the Plinthic subgroups and increased by 2.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 in Oxisols.: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of the no-tillage system on soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and carbon stocks in Plinthic subgroups and Oxisols, located in Pontes and Lacerda, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil.

TI  - Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares-an area greater than the entire country of Mexico-has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1-25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas.

TI  - A country-scale analysis revealed effective land-use zoning affecting forest cover changes in Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The permanent forest estate (PFE) is a tool for maintaining forest areas in perpetuity. The PFE can have several different land-use zones based on different purposes. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PFE in reducing deforestation using country-scale datasets of forest cover change between 2006 and 2017 in Myanmar. We also evaluated the effectiveness of PFE land-use zones such as protected areas (PAs) and production forests in reducing deforestation. The effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching to minimize the effect of the non-random distribution of the PFE and specific land-use zoning. The results showed that the PFE significantly reduced deforestation compared to non-PFE areas. Within the PFE, both PAs and production forests had lower deforestation than non-PFE. However, both the PFE and non-PFE showed an increased trend of annual deforestation between 2006 and 2017. Production forests also showed an increased trend of annual deforestation although PAs did not. We concluded that the PFE, PAs and production forests are effective in reducing deforestation. However, in Myanmar, further efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the increase of deforestation in the PFE, especially in production forests.

TI  - Differential seedling establishment of woody plants along a tree density gradient in Neotropical savannas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seedling dynamics are crucial for understanding spatial plant distribution patterns, yet little is known about seedling establishment in Neotropical savannas because empirical studies at the community level are scarce. Over 2 years, we studied the recruitment and survival of an initial seedling assemblage and three cohorts of recruits of woody plants within 216 plots of 1 m2 located along a tree density gradient in the savannas of central Brazil. These savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover, from closed (high canopy cover) to open savannas (low canopy cover), and are located along shallow topographic gradients. We measured community-wide seedling limitation (i.e. proportion of 1-m2 plots without seedlings of any woody species), photosynthetic photon flux density, litter cover, soil moisture and soil nutrients in each savanna type. Because closed savannas had lower PPFD and higher leaf litter cover than open savannas, we evaluated the effects of light level and litter cover on seedling emergence of nine dominant savanna woody species under controlled conditions in a glasshouse. Density, recruitment and survival of seedlings decreased over time because of mortality in all savanna types, but they were consistently higher in closed than in open savannas. Community-wide seedling limitation was significantly lower in closed (0.16 +/- 0.03) than in open (0.30 +/- 0.05) savannas. In the glasshouse, high litter cover and very low light levels reduced seedling emergence of most species, suggesting an adaptation to delay seed germination until the wet season when soil water availability is high and leaf litter rapidly decomposes. Synthesis: In Neotropical savannas, tree canopy cover facilitates seedling establishment of woody species by reducing stressful environmental conditions. In particular, low irradiance and high litter cover in closed savannas enhance the recruitment and survival of woody seedlings relative to open savannas by reducing soil water deficits and increasing nutrient availability in the upper soil layers. The higher seedling limitation of tree species in open than in closed savannas contributes to maintain relatively different balances between trees and herbaceous plants along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas and helps to explain spatial distribution patterns of woody species in these ecosystems.

TI  - Fodder grass productivity and soil fertility changes under four grass plus tree associations in Kerala, India
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adapted tree+grass combinations make a valuable contribution to forage production in the Indian peninsula, but knowledge of the interactive effects between trees and grasses on their production is limited. We, therefore, conducted a field experiment involving combinations of four trees and grasses, besides monospecific grass controls, for seven years, to investigate grass productivity in association with leguminous and non- leguminous multipurpose trees (MPT) having disparate canopy architecture, and to assess the end-of-rotation soil fertility changes. Post rotation changes in herbage productivity were evaluated by growing teosinte (Zea mexicana) for three years. The four MPTs were Acacia auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala. Grasses included Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid napier), Brachiaria ruziziensis (congo signal), Panicum maximum (guinea grass) and teosinte. Lower tree branches were pruned from fifth year. Understorey herbage production increased until three years in all tree+grass combinations, but declined subsequently, as tree crowns expanded. Overall, casuarina among MPTs, and hybrid napier and guinea grass among forage crops, were more productive than others. Pruning MPTs generally favoured greater herbage production. Understorey light levels for acacia, ailanthus, casuarina and leucaena were 17, 60, 55 and 55% of that in the open at five years. During the post-rotation phase, MPT plots were characterised by higher soil nutrient capital and consequently teosinte yields were higher than in the treeless control treatment. All previous tree-grass combinations showed an increasing trend till two years after MPT felling. Yield levels declined subsequently, despite at variable rates. Careful selection of the tree and grass components is, therefore, crucial for optimising herbage productivity in silvopastoral systems.

TI  - 'Murundus' structures in the semi-arid region of Brazil: testing their geographical congruence with mound-building termites (Blattodea: Termitoidea: Termitidae)
T2  - ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth mounds called 'murundus' are conspicuous features in the semi-arid region of Brazil, where their distribution and origin remain largely unknown. We adopted an approach based on spatially explicit mapping and modeling to determine the current and potential geographical distribution of murundus. We set up a systematic grid survey to map their current distribution using high-resolution satellite imagery available via free open source software. To obtain insights into the origin of these earth mounds, predictive models were used to test their geographical congruence with six mound-building termites ( genera Cornitermes Wasmann, 1897, and Syntermes Holmgren, 1909). The Maxent algorithm was used to generate the potential distribution models based on a set of five variables related to primary environmental regimes that determine the fundamental niche of termite species. To analyze if there was some congruence between associated environmental variables, we cross-checked the results obtained from the statistical tests using MAXENT software. Murundus mostly occur in the south-central region of the Caatinga biome (i.e. seasonally dry tropical forest) in areas with moderate annual mean temperature (2024 degrees C) and precipitation (600-910 mm), and soils with moderate to severe constraints concerning nutrient availability. We observed a strong geographical congruence between the potential distributions of densely packed murundus and four mound-building termites [i.e. Cornitermes bequaerti Emerson, 1952,degrees C. silvestrii Emerson, 1949, Syntermes dirus (Burmeister, 1839) and S. wheeleri (Emerson, 1925)]. Based on the significant association of those distributions with the climate and soil nutrient availability, we concluded that the formation of murundus in the semi-arid domain might be an adaptive response of mound-building termites to particular regional environmental conditions.

TI  - Spread and impact of introduced conifers in South America: Lessons from other southern hemisphere regions
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of conifers introduced earlier elsewhere in the southern hemisphere suggests that recent invasions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are likely to increase in number and size. In South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30 years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest, alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate. Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America. Pressure from foreign customers in South Africa has led most companies there to seek certification through the Forestry Stewardship Council; a similar programme operates in Australia. Such an approach may be promising in South America.

TI  - Production and disease resistance of elite black bean lines previously selected using mineral nitrogen fertilization cultivated with natural versus artificial nitrogen supplementation
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the most important soil nutrient for common beans; the main sources are mineral N fertilizers and symbiotic N fixation (SNF). The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is a N fixing species, but breeding programs have neglected this fact. We investigates black seeded elite lines grown with mineral N fertilization or using inoculation with rhizobia to select lines with broad adaptability, high yield stability, and high agronomic performance. Fifteen black seeded common bean elite lines and cultivars, all of them selected under mineral N fertilization, were evaluated in major bean crop regions in the Brazilian states of Goias, Parana and Distrito Federal in different growing seasons and years, totaling 13 environments (combination of location/growing season/year). Two side-by-side experiments were set up in each environment, one exclusively with mineral N fertilization (total of 80 kg ha(-1) of N) and another with Rhizobium inoculation only. The agronomic traits evaluated were seed yield, 100-seed weight, sieve yield, reaction to anthracnose and angular leaf spot. The nodulation traits evaluated were number of nodules and nodule dry matter, specific weight of nodules and relative nodulation index. The N source significantly affected seed yield, 100-seed weight and reaction to anthracnose. All lines produced a higher yield and had higher 100-seed weight under N mineral fertilization; but they were more resistant to disease when inoculated with rhizobia. The interaction between lines and N sources was significant for seed yield, sieve yield, and reaction to anthracnose. However, it did not affect selection of the best lines regardless of N source. The cultivars BRS FP403 and BRS Esteio are recommended for planting with either of the two N sources because they were the highest yielding and exhibited high adaptability and stability under both N supply systems. Selection of superior lines does not appear to depend on the source of N used during crop development. The lines BRS Campeiro and CNFP 15177 gave the highest nodulation index, indicating that these lines should be used in crosses with high yielding lines to produce lines with high seed yield and high nodulation, reducing possible yield losses in SNF systems compared to those that useonly mineral N fertilizer.

TI  - Pasture recovery, emissions, and the Brazilian Paris agreement commitments
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the socioeconomic, land use change, and greenhouse gases emissions impacts of degraded pastures recovery (DPR) in Brazil, assessing the contribution to the Brazilian Paris Agreement commitments. We used a Computable General Equilibrium model, TERM-BR15, in a scenario simulation for the period 2015-2035. The simulation includes DPR shocks of productivity, investments, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) fixation. We used two carbon accounting methods for the impacts on emissions, the original method of Brazil's emissions inventory, which does not consider SOC, and the alternative method, which includes SOC fixation. Results show a 0.56% growth in Gross Domestic Product and 0.73% in real household consumption relative to the 2035 baseline. There would be a social return of R$80.5 billion (in 2023 prices), representing R$8.27 for every real invested. Less developed and more dependent on cattle ranching regions would benefit the most. Cattle ranching would expand production using less area, resulting in a land-saving effect of 1.15 million hectares in 2035. GHG emissions would increase by 7.83% in the original accounting method, resulting from herd and economic growth. In the alternative method, 0.23% mitigation would occur, showing that SOC fixation can more than offset the economic activity growth. Independently of the GHG accounting method Brazil would achieve the 2025 mitigation target of 37% relative to 2005 but would not meet the 50% mitigation target of 2030. SOC fixation could contribute up to 5.7% of the 2030 mitigation target. Our results show that DPR is a sustainable production system that increases economic growth, avoids deforestation, and could mitigate GHG emissions. We provide information on regional impacts suitable for better decision-making for pasture restoration incentives in Brazil.

TI  - Regeneration and restoration of degraded peat swamp forest in Berbak NP, Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - Malayan Nature Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is unfortunately an ever-increasing phenomenon in peatlands of Southeast Asia, where most tropical peatland occurs. This paper assesses natural regeneration of vegetation in burnt parts of Berbak National Park in Jambi Province (Sumatra), Indonesia, and restoration trials carried out in the reserve by the forestry department. Six vegetation types are recognised, each representing a different level of degeneration or stage of regeneration. With resources for assisted restoration being very limited, the authors recommend that efforts target degradation types that are unlikely to regenerate rapidly on their own, but where success is likely. Trials indicate that replanting should utilise indigenous species adapted to local conditions such as flooding, and a list of 24 candidate species is provided. Berbak continues to be threatened by fires, and without adequate protection further restoration is not advised.

TI  - Governance and Deforestation: Understanding the Role of Formal Rule-Acknowledgement by Residents in Brazilian Extractive Reserves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has one of the most extensive and effective sets of deforestation control policies in the world. One of the main deforestation control policies implemented by the Brazilian government over the last 15 years has been the creation of an extensive system of protected areas, including extractive reserves. Our study addresses the challenges of reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We analyze the role of institutions in controlling deforestation, focusing on the formal rules contained within the Management Agreements of extractive reserves. We chose two extreme cases: the Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve and the Rio Cautario Extractive Reserve, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. Within each case, we analyzed the association between the recognition of the formal rules and the extent of deforestation. We collected data through eight focus groups, with a total of 61 reserve residents, which used a didactic story to understand reserve residents' familiarity with the Management Agreement rules. In both cases, there was high recognition of the formal rules governing natural resource use in the reserves, although there was heterogeneity among communities and in the mechanisms that facilitate recognition. The factors contributing to the recognition and non-recognition of the formal rules by reserve residents included: learning strategies (theoretical and practical); speed of institutional change; rules content (ambiguous and not well-adapted); endogenous factors (e.g. leadership, relationships); and exogenous factors (e.g. economic change, conflict and pressures).

TI  - Forest restoration rehabilitates soil multifunctionality in riparian zones of sugarcane production landscapes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian sugarcane plays a vital role in the production of both sugar and renewable energy. However, land use change and long-term conventional sugarcane cultivation have degraded entire watersheds, including a substantial loss of soil multifunctionality. In our study, riparian zones have been reforested to mitigate these impacts, protect aquatic ecosys-tems, and restore ecological corridors within the sugarcane production landscapes. We examined (i) how forest resto-ration enables rehabilitation of the soil's multifunctionality after long-term sugarcane cultivation and (ii) how long it takes to regain ecosystem functions comparable to those of a primary forest. We investigated a time series of riparian forests at 6, 15, and 30 years after starting restoration by planting trees (named 'active restoration') and determined soil C stocks, & delta;13C (indicative of C origin), as well as measures indicative of soil health. A primary forest and a long-term sugarcane field were used as references. Eleven soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators were used for a structured soil health assessment, calculating index scores based on soil functions. Forest-to-cane conversion reduced 30.6 Mg ha-1 of soil C stocks, causing soil compaction and loss of cation exchange capacity, thus degrading soil's phys-ical, chemical, and biological functions. Forest restoration for 6-30 years recovered 16-20 Mg C ha-1 stored in soils. In all restored sites, soil functions such as supporting root growth, aerating the soil, nutrient storage capacity, and provid-ing C energy for microbial activity were gradually recovered. Thirty years of active restoration was sufficient to reach the primary forest state in overall soil health index, multifunctional performance, and C sequestration. We conclude that active forest restoration in sugarcane-dominated landscapes is an effective way to restore soil multifunctionality approaching the level of the native forest in approximately three decades. Moreover, the C sequestration in the re-stored forest soils will help to mediate global warming.

TI  - Implementing REDD plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation): evidence on governance, evaluation and impacts from the REDD-ALERT project
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project started in 2009 and finished in 2012, and had the aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account-it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work-these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world's forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services.

TI  - Potential vectors of Leishmania spp. in an Atlantic Forest conservation unit in northeastern Brazil under anthropic pressure
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Phlebotomines are a group of insects which include vectors of the Leishmania parasites that cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), diseases primarily affecting populations of low socioeconomic status. VL in Brazil is caused by Leishmania infantum, with transmission mainly attributed to Lutzomyia longipalpis, a species complex of sand fly, and is concentrated mainly in the northeastern part of the country. CL is distributed worldwide and occurs in five regions of Brazil, at a higher incidence in the north and northeast regions, with etiological agents, vectors, reservoirs and epidemiological patterns that differ from VL. The aim of this study was to determine the composition, distribution and ecological relationships of phlebotomine species in an Atlantic Forest conservation unit and nearby residential area in northeastern Brazil.Methods: Centers for Disease Control and Shannon traps were used for collections, the former at six points inside the forest and in the peridomestic environment of surrounding residences, three times per month for 36 months, and the latter in a forest area, once a month for 3 months. The phlebotomines identified were compared with climate data using simple linear correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient and cross-correlation. The estimate of ecological parameters was calculated according to the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, standardized index of species abundance and the dominance index.Results: A total of 75,499 phlebotomines belonging to 11 species were captured in the CDC traps, the most abundant being Evandromyia walkeri, Psychodopygus wellcomei and Lu. longipalpis. Evandromyia walkeri abundance was most influenced by temperature at collection time and during the months preceding collection and rainfall during the months preceding collection. Psychodopygus wellcomei abundance was most affected by rainfall and relative humidity during the collection month and the month immediately preceding collection time. Lutzomyia longipalpis abundance showed a correlation with temperature and the rainfall during the months preceding collection time. The Shannon trap contained a total of 3914 phlebotomines from these different species. Psychodopygus wellcomei, accounting for 91.93% of the total, was anthropophilic and active mainly at night.Conclusions: Most of the species collected in the traps were seasonal and exhibited changes in their composition and population dynamics associated with local adaptions. The presence of vectors Ps. wellcomei and Lu. longipalpis underscore the epidemiological importance of these phlebotomines in the conservation unit and surrounding anthropized areas. Neighboring residential areas should be permanently monitored to prevent VL or CL transmission and outbreaks.

TI  - Soil processes and properties related to the genesis and evolution of a Pleistocene savanna palm swamp (vereda) in central Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The peat properties of Brazilian palm swamps, or veredas, as they are locally known, lend these environments the character of water reservoirs and carbon stores, in addition to being important archives of past changes. In this paper, we present, in high-resolution, the stratigraphy and morphological, physical, chemical, elemental, and isotopic properties of a deep soil vereda core (Pau Grande, with 283 cm) from the Grande Serta tilde o Veredas National Park, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The core is constituted by 10 histic horizons in the first 151 cm, and one mineral layer from 151 to 283 cm. Peat sedimentation rates were different along its depth, as follow: 0.0273 cm year(-1) (109-111 cm), 0.0018 cm year(- 1) (85-87 cm), 0.0027 cm year(-1) (59-61 cm), 0.0031 cm year(-1) (45-47 cm), and 0.0042 cm year(-1) (24-26 cm). Mean values of the main peat properties were: 16% for C, 44% for Si,-17.20%o for delta C-13, 3.68%o for delta N-15, 167% for gravimetric moisture, 75% for mineral material, 8% for rubbed fibres, 3.58 for pH, 0.77 Mg m(-3) for bulk density, and 0.15 for bulk density of the organic matter. Principal components analysis was applied to peat properties to assist in the identification of processes/drivers that control the nature of the studied vereda, in addition to providing evidence of changes in the paleoenvironment. The first principal component, PC1, is related to the relative accumulation of organic versus local mineral matter, linked to the evolution of the catchment soils (erosion) and possible associated vegetation (C3 and C4 plants); PC2 is related to the hydromorphism conditions; PC3 is related to the incorporation of inorganic material through the deposition of dust from regional sources; and PC4 is related to the main sources of organic matter. Radiocarbon dating indicates this vereda began its formation during the late Pleistocene. Five phases of changes in the environment were also verified: I) 33,309-26,818 cal BP - formation of a lake or a shallow water body, pre-dominance of algae, and locally and regionally unstable environment; II) 26,818-16,659 cal BP - predominance of terrestrial plants, locally stable but regionally unstable environment; III) 16,659-10,401 cal BP - oxic, drier environment with a predominance of C4 terrestrial plants, and a simultaneous increase in local instability with stabilization of the regional environment at similar to 15.0 kyr cal BP; IV) 10,401-5,052 cal BP - return to being an algal source in even more oxic conditions, and beginning of greater stability in both the local and regional environ-ments; and V) 5,052 cal BP until present - consolidation of the stable environment initiated in the previous phase, characteristic reducing environment to that currently found in the Pau Grande vereda, and changing the contribution of organic matter sources, initially with terrestrial plants and, subsequently, algae. Our results suggest that the Pau Grande vereda is a complex ecosystem. These environments have a large potential for studies on environmental reconstruction and climate changes that have occurred since the late Pleistocene, and they should be fully protected.

TI  - Soil factors effects on life history attributes of Leiothrix spiralis and Leiothrix vivipara (Eriocaulaceae) on rupestrian grasslands in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we hypothesized that the life history traits of Leiothrix spiralis and L. vivipara would be linked to soil factors of the rupestrian grasslands and that rosette size would be influenced by soil moisture. Soil analyses were performed from five populations of L. spiralis and four populations of L. vivipara. In each area, three replicates were employed in 19 areas of occurrence of Leiothrix species, and we quantified the life history attributes. The microhabitats of these species show low favorability regarding to soil factors. During the dry season, their rosettes decreased in diameter due the loss of its most outlying leaves. The absence of seedlings indicated the low fecundity of both species. However, both species showed rapid population growth by pseudovivipary. Both L. spiralis and L. vivipara exhibit a kind of parental care that was quantified by the presence of connections between parental-rosettes and ramets. The findings of the present study show that the life history traits are linked to soil factors.

TI  - Metabolomics ofMyrcia bellaPopulations in Brazilian Savanna Reveals Strong Influence of Environmental Factors on Its Specialized Metabolism
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental conditions influence specialized plant metabolism. However, many studies aiming to understand these modulations have been conducted with model plants and/or under controlled conditions, thus not reflecting the complex interaction between plants and environment. To fully grasp these interactions, we investigated the specialized metabolism and genetic diversity of a native plant in its natural environment. We choseMyrcia belladue to its medicinal interest and occurrence in Brazilian savanna regions with diverse climate and soil conditions. An LC-HRMS-based metabolomics approach was applied to analyze 271 samples harvested across seven regions during the dry and rainy season. Genetic diversity was assessed in a subset of 40 samples using amplified fragment length polymorphism. Meteorological factors including rainfall, temperature, radiation, humidity, and soil nutrient and mineral composition were recorded in each region and correlated with chemical variation through multivariate analysis (MVDA). Marker compounds were selected using a statistically informed molecular network and annotated by dereplication against an in silico database of natural products. The integrated results evidenced different chemotypes, with variation in flavonoid and tannin content mainly linked to soil conditions. Different levels of genetic diversity and distance of populations were found to be correlated with the identified chemotypes. These observations and the proposed analytical workflow contribute to the global understanding of the impact of abiotic factors and genotype on the accumulation of given metabolites and, therefore, could be valuable to guide further medicinal exploration of native species.

TI  - Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diversity among Stylosanthes species: Habitat, edaphic and agro-climatic affinities leading to cultivar development
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the introduction of Stylosanthes, a range legume, in India in early seventies extensive efforts have been made for its evaluation and adaptation. However, limited germplasm and narrow genetic base were major impediments in its wider adaptations. Of late, introduction of several new improved germplasm including newly identified species, cultivars and bred materials from Australia, Colombia, Brazil and Ethiopia and their evaluation at selected centers under different agro-climatic conditions improved the existing scenario as many lines including S. scabra RRR as well as newly introduced species S. seabrana has shown great promise for diverse agro-climatic zones. Because of concerted efforts which was largely generated from the recently concluded Austrialian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) stylo project and background study during the period of early eighties Stylosanthes has been considered as the most important tropical legume which not only improve the soil fertility but also provide nutritive forage. Two species namely S. hamata and S. scabra largely contribute to the supply of forages for cattle, buffalo, goats and sheep. As a nitrogen fixing legume, the plant helps replenish soil nutrients when used in ley farming, mixed and inter-cropping systems. The scenario has largely changed due to the better performance of newly introduced S. seabrana species which possessed high seedling vigour high nutritional parameters and better adaptation under rain-fed situations in heavy clay and cracking soil types. It provides good foliage and being erect and low sticky in nature showed compatibility for mixed cropping. Results also demonstrated reasonable yield in first year by all four major species which ultimately geared up in second year of growth. This was stable in S. hamata and S. viscosa for another two years whereas other two species namely S. scabra and S. seabrana indicated enhanced yield in consecutive years.

TI  - Influence of trees on soil nutrient pools in a silvopastoral system in the Brazilian Savannah
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been suggested as an approach to reduce pasture degradation and, consequently, reduce the deforestation of new areas in the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). This study assessed the contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 19A degrees 35' 36aEuro(3) S, 43A degrees 51' 56aEuro(3) W; altitude 747 m. The SPS has developed since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees ha(-1). The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+). In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole. In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree, forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are unlikely.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of pyrite and evaluating soil and water properties in idle swamp land: A strategy to promote sustainable paddy field establishment and prevent land degradation
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The idle swamp land of the former mega rice project in Indonesia has the potential for development of paddy field as a response to the global food crisis. Mapping of pyrite (FeS 2 ) in swamp land as the key driver of soil degradation and poor water quality has not been made to establish a strategy for sustainable paddy field practices. The objective of the study was to assess the spatial distribution of pyrite (FeS 2 ) through detailed mapping, and to evaluate soil and water properties associated with the adverse effects of pyrite. Detailed conventional pyrite mapping with a grid system at 1:10,000 scale, covering a large area of 26,588 ha, had been made. A comprehensive analysis of soil chemical, physical and mineralogical properties, pyrite content, and water properties was conducted. The detailed pyrite mapping showed that spatial distribution of pyrite was delineated into six depth classes, in the order of decreasing extent: P3 -moderately deep (>50 - 75 cm) > P4 -deep (>75 - 100 cm) >> P5 -very deep (>100 - 150 cm) > P2 -shallow (>25 - 50 cm) > P6 -exceptionally deep (>150 cm) > P1 -very shallow (0 - 25 cm). These pyrite classes allow zonation management strategy of soils and water table into different depths to avoid pyrite oxidation and its harmful effect. Soils have limited easily weathered minerals (<16 %), implying low inherited soil nutrients. In the topsoils, chemical properties exhibited extreme acidity (pH 3.8 - 4.2), imbalanced cations with excess Mg, low in K and P and Zn, Cu, and Mn micronutrients. The dynamic changes of water properties in network canals showed a drop in pH from 6.0 at the inlet and primary canal to 2.9 and 3.5 in the canal network (secondary > tertiary > quaternary > pyrite collector), as well as the increased Al and SO 4 ions suggests the decrease in quality throughout the canal network. We propose the management strategy for the sustainable establishment of paddy field in pyritic swamp areas including: (i) performing detailed mapping of pyrite classes to guide depth -based pyrite zonation to control water table, (ii) implementing controlled drainage water flow from inlet to various canal networks corresponds to pyrite depth zonation, (iii) applying lime with Ca -rich materials but not dolomite (containing Mg) to improve cation balance, reduce acidity, increase soil pH and suppress ion toxicity, (iv) utilizing adaptive/tolerant rice cultivars to acidity, and (v) application of NPK fertilizer to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. These strategies can be implemented to ensure the sustainability of paddy fields and avoid soil degradation in swamp land.

TI  - VARIABILITY OF ROOT TRAITS IN COMMON BEAN GENOTYPES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PHOSPHORUS SUPPLY AND ONTOGENETIC STAGES
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Selection of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars with enhanced root growth would be a strategy for increasing P uptake and grain yield in tropical soils, but the strong plasticity of root traits may compromise their inclusion in breeding programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the genotypic variability of root traits in common bean plants at two ontogenetic stages and two soil P levels. Twenty-four common bean genotypes, comprising the four growth habits that exist in the species and two wild genotypes, were grown in 4 kg pots at two levels of applied P (20 and 80 mg kg(-1)) and harvested at the stages of pod setting and early pod filling. Root area and root length were measured by digital image analysis. Significant genotype x P level and genotype x harvest interactions in analysis of variance indicate that the genotypic variation of root traits depended on soil nutrient availability and the stage at which evaluation was made. Genotypes differed for taproot mass, basal and lateral root mass, root area and root length at both P levels and growth stages; differences in specific root area and length were small. Genotypes with growth habits II (upright indeterminate) and III (prostrate indeterminate) showed better adaptation to limited P supply than genotypes of groups I (determinate) and IV (indeterminate climbing). Between the two harvests, genotypes of groups II and III increased the mass of basal and lateral roots by 40 and 50 %, respectively, whereas genotypes of groups I and IV by only 7 and 19 %. Values of the genotypic coefficient of determination, which estimates the proportion of phenotypic variance resulting from genetic effects, were higher at early pod filling than at pod setting. Correlations between shoot mass and root mass, which could indicate indirect selection of root systems via aboveground biomass, were higher at early pod filling than at pod setting. The results indicate that selection for root traits in common bean genotypes should preferentially be performed at the early pod-filling stage.

TI  - Habitat structure and food resources for wildlife across successional stages in a tropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest.

CP  - International Workshop on the International Regime - Avoided Deforestation and the Evolution of Public and Private Policies Towards Forests in Developing Countries
CL  - Paris, FRANCE
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) is considered a significant mitigation opportunity. Forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon has traditionally been highest in the world and, thus, represents a likely target for future REDD initiatives. The paper presents an ex-ante assessment of the potential REDD costs in two of the three largest states in the Brazilian Amazon using official land use and cover change statistics. The two states, Mato Grosso and Amazonas, historically feature largely different land use dynamics. The findings focus on the Opportunity costs of REDD and suggest that at least I million ha of projected deforestation in Mato Grosso and Amazonas could be compensated for at Current carbon prices until 2017. Total costs may differ between US$ 330 million and over US$ I billion depending on how payment mechanisms are designed. Implications of payment scheme design for the political economy of REDD are discussed.

TI  - Floodplain forests drive fruit- eating fish diversity at the Amazon Basin-scale.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike most rivers globally, nearly all lowland Amazonian rivers have unregulated flow, supporting seasonally flooded floodplain forests. Floodplain forests harbor a unique tree species assemblage adapted to flooding and specialized fauna, including fruit-eating fish that migrate seasonally into floodplains, favoring expansive floodplain areas. Frugivorous fish are forest-dependent fauna critical to forest regeneration via seed dispersal and support commercial and artisanal fisheries. We implemented linear mixed effects models to investigate drivers of species richness among specialized frugivorous fishes across the [approximately]6,000,000 km2 Amazon Basin, analyzing 29 species from 9 families (10,058 occurrences). Floodplain predictors per subbasin included floodplain forest extent, tree species richness (309,540 occurrences for 2,506 species), water biogeochemistry, flood duration, and elevation, with river order controlling for longitudinal positioning along the river network. We observed heterogeneous patterns of frugivorous fish species richness, which were positively correlated with floodplain forest extent, tree species richness, and flood duration. The natural hydrological regime facilitates fish access to flooded forests and controls fruit production. Thus, the ability of Amazonian floodplain ecosystems to support frugivorous fish assemblages hinges on extensive and diverse seasonally flooded forests. Given the low functional redundancy in fish seed dispersal networks, diverse frugivorous fish assemblages disperse and maintain diverse forests; vice versa, diverse forests maintain more fish species, underscoring the critically important taxonomic interdependencies that embody Amazonian ecosystems. Effective management strategies must acknowledge that access to diverse and hydrologically functional floodplain forests is essential to ensure the long-term survival of frugivorous fish and, in turn, the long-term sustainability of floodplain forests.

TI  - Water availability determines the richness and density of fig trees within Brazilian semideciduous forest landscapes
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of fig trees in tropical ecosystems is evidenced by the great diversity (+750 species) and wide geographic distribution of the genus. We assessed the contribution of environmental variables on the species richness and density of fig trees in fragments of seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) in Brazil. We assessed 20 forest fragments in three regions in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Fig tree richness and density was estimated in rectangular plots, comprising 31.4 ha sampled. Both richness and fig tree density were linearly modeled as function of variables representing (1) fragment metrics, (2) forest structure, and (3) landscape metrics expressing water drainage in the fragments. Model selection was performed by comparing the AIC values (Akaike Information Criterion) and the relative weight of each model (wAIC). Both species richness and fig tree density were better explained by the water availability in the fragment (meter of streams/ha): wAIC(richness) = 0.45, wAIC(density) = 0.96. The remaining variables related to anthropic perturbation and forest structure were of little weight in the models. The rainfall seasonality in SSF seems to select for both establishment strategies and morphological adaptations in the hemiepiphytic fig tree species. In the studied SSF, hemiepiphytes established at lower heights in their host trees than reported for fig trees in evergreen rainforests. Some hemiepiphytic fig species evolved superficial roots extending up to 100 m from their trunks, resulting in hectare-scale root zones that allow them to efficiently forage water and soil nutrients. The community of fig trees was robust to variation in forest structure and conservation level of SSF fragments, making this group of plants an important element for the functioning of seasonal tropical forests.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of Brazilian livestock production through optimized pasture restoration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program ("Programa ABC"). The model estimates El using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$.ha(-1).yr(-1)) to around 300R$.ha(-1).yr(-1), respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated El of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO(2)e/kg ONE) relative to 3.59 kg CO(2)e/kg CWE for optimized management Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EL The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAL (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of Spreading Out Termite Mound Material on Ferralsol Fertility, Katanga, DR Congo
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Around Lubumbashi, the introduction of large-scale pivot-irrigated agriculture entails leveling of large termite mounds during field preparation. The effect on soil fertility and crop yield (Solanum tuberosum and Alium cepa) is evaluated along 11 transects extending from a former termite mound location to reference soil that received no termite mound material. Spreading mound material was found to increase the pH, calcium carbonates CaCO3 content, and the amount of resin-extractable phosphorus (P), other possible effects being undone by fertilizer application. On the other hand, poor physical properties of the mound material seem to have adverse effects on crop production. While the benefits of spreading out mound material seem limited for large-scale farmers with access to fertilizers, the use of mound material may present an opportunity to resource-poor farmers throughout the miombo eco-region, provided that the application of mound materials is optimized and that any adverse effect on soil physical properties can be mitigated.

TI  - Interacting municipal-level anthropogenic and ecological disturbances drive changes in Neotropical forest carbon storage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is a documented driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem services in the tropics. However, less is known on how interacting regional and local-level anthropogenic and ecological disturbances such as land use activities, human populations, and armed conflict affect carbon storage and emissions in Neotropical forests. Therefore, we explored how local-scale, socio-ecological drivers affect carbon dynamics across space and time in a region in Colombia characterized by deforestation, land use cover (LULC) changes, and armed conflict. Specifically, using available municipal level data from a period of armed conflict (2009-2012), spatiotemporal analyses, and multivariate models, we analyzed the effects of a suite of socio-ecological drivers (e.g., armed conflict, illicit crops, human population, agriculture, etc.) on deforestation and carbon storage-emission dynamics. We found that about 0.4% of the initial forest cover area was converted to other LULC types, particularly pastures and crops. Gross C storage emissions were 4.14 Mt C, while gross carbon sequestration was 1.43 Mt C; primarily due to forest regeneration. We found that livestock ranching, illegal crop cultivation, and rural population were significant drivers of deforestation and carbon storage changes, while the influential role of armed conflict was less clear. However, temporal dynamics affected the magnitude of LULC effects and deforestation on carbon storage and emissions. The approach and findings can be used to better inform medium to long-term local and regional planning and decision-making related to forest conservation and ecosystem service policies in Neotropical forests experiencing disturbances related to global change and socio-political events like armed conflict.

TI  - The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forests and second growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation.

TI  - Natural regeneration as a tool for large-scale forest restoration in the tropics: prospects and challenges
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Classifying Inundation in a Tropical Wetlands Complex with GNSS-R
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements for classification of inundated wetlands is presented. With the launch of NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, space-borne GNSS-R measurements have become available over ocean and land. CYGNSS covers latitudes between +/- 38 degrees, providing measurements over tropical ecosystems and benefiting new studies of wetland inundation dynamics. The GNSS-R signal over inundated wetlands is driven mainly by coherent scattering associated with the presence of surface water, producing strong forward scattering and a distinctive bistatic scattering signature. This paper presents a methodology used to classify inundation in tropical wetlands using observables derived from GNSS-R measurements and ancillary data. The methodology employs a multiple decision tree randomized (MDTR) algorithm for classification and wetland inundation maps derived from the phased-array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR-2) as reference for training and validation. The development of an innovative GNSS-R wetland classification methodology is aimed to advance mapping of global wetland distribution and dynamics, which is critical for improved estimates of natural methane production. The results obtained in this manuscript demonstrate the ability of GNSS-R signals to detect inundation under dense vegetation over the Pacaya-Samiria Natural Reserve, a tropical wetland complex located in the Peruvian Amazon. Classification results report an accuracy of 69% for regions of inundated vegetation, 87% for open water regions, and 99% for non-inundated areas. Misclassification of inundated vegetation, primarily as non-inundated area, is likely related to the combination of two factors: partial inundation within the GNSS-R scattering area, and signal attenuation from dense overstory vegetation, resulting in a low signal.

TI  - Very high resolution canopy height maps from RGB imagery using self-supervised vision transformer and convolutional decoder trained on aerial lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation structure mapping is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and monitoring nature-based approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. Repeated measurements of these data allow for the observation of deforestation or degradation of existing forests, natural forest regeneration, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices like agroforestry. Assessments of tree canopy height and crown projected area at a high spatial resolution are also important for monitoring carbon fluxes and assessing tree-based land uses, since forest structures can be highly spatially heterogeneous, especially in agroforestry systems. Very high resolution satellite imagery (less than one meter (1 m) Ground Sample Distance) makes it possible to extract information at the tree level while allowing monitoring at a very large scale. This paper presents the first high-resolution canopy height map concurrently produced for multiple sub-national jurisdictions. Specifically, we produce very high resolution canopy height maps for the states of California and Sao Paulo, a significant improvement in resolution over the ten meter (10 m) resolution of previous Sentinel / GEDI based worldwide maps of canopy height. The maps are generated by the extraction of features from a self-supervised model trained on Maxar imagery from 2017 to 2020, and the training of a dense prediction decoder against aerial lidar maps. We also introduce a post -processing step using a convolutional network trained on GEDI observations. We evaluate the proposed maps with set-aside validation lidar data as well as by comparing with other remotely sensed maps and field-collected data, and find our model produces an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.8 m and Mean Error (ME) of 0.6 m.

TI  - Deforestation Simplifies Understory Bird Seed-Dispersal Networks in Human-Modified Landscapes.
T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by land-use changes through human activities. This is mainly due to the conversion of continuous forests into forest fragments surrounded by anthropogenic matrices. In general, sensitive species are lost while species adapted to disturbances succeed in altered environments. However, whether the interactions performed by the persisting species are also modified, and how it scales up to the network level throughout the landscape are virtually unknown in most tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Here we evaluated how landscape predictors (forest cover, total core area, edge density, inter-patch isolation) and local characteristics (fruit availability, vegetation complexity) affected understory birds seed-dispersal networks in 19 forest fragments along the hyperdiverse but highly depauperate northeast distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Also, our sampled sites were distributed in two regions with contrasting land cover changes. We used mist nets to obtain samples of understory bird food contents to identify the plant species consumed and dispersed by them. We estimated network complexity on the basis of the number of interactions, links per species, interaction evenness, and modularity. Our findings showed that the number of interactions increased with the amount of forest cover, and it was significantly lower in the more deforested region. None of the other evaluated parameters were affected by any other landscape or local predictors. We also observed a lack of significant network structure compared to null models, which we attribute to a pervasive impoverishment of bird and plant communities in these highly modified landscapes. Our results demonstrate the importance of forest cover not only to maintain species diversity but also their respective mutualistic relationships, which are the bases for ecosystem functionality, forest regeneration and the provision of ecological services.

TI  - Regrowing forests contribution to law compliance and carbon storage in private properties of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The viability of the climate pledges made by Brazil at the COP21 in Paris, 2015, heavily depends on the success of the country policies related to forest governance. Particularly, there are high expectations that the enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) will drive large-scale forest recovery and carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the BFC, considering different law implementation settings. Focusing on the Amazon Biome, we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry ( approximate to 250,000 properties) onto land cover maps to quantify on-site forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery. Similarly, we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for offsite deficit compensation (i.e. via market-based forest certificates trade). Regrowing forests could reduce, on-site, 3.2 Mho of forests deficits, decreasing non-compliance from private properties by 35%. Likewise, forest certificates availability increased by 3.4 Mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations. This means an increase in the forest certificate offer-demand ratio from 0.9 to 2.0. On the one hand, trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a low-cost strategy for compliance with the BFC, a pathway for achieving restoration targets, and an additional source of income for landholders. To meet this potential, it is necessary to better conceptualize second-growth forests, advancing the poor definitions presented by the BFC, and offer an operational basis for their protection. On the other hand, including regrowing forests' certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected old-growth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions. We highlight that the BFC implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement.

TI  - Foreign capital, forest change and regulatory compliance in Congo Basin forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest change is driven by demand in distant markets. Equally, investments in tropical forest landscapes by capital originating from distant emerging economies are on the rise. Understanding how forest outcomes vary by investment source is therefore becoming increasingly important. We empirically evaluate the relationship between investment source and deforestation from 2000 to 2010 in the Republic of Congo. A Congolese forestry code was implemented in 2000 to mitigate degradation of production forests by standardizing all logging in the country according to sustainable forest management (SFM) guidelines. Following the implementation of this law, the majority (73%) of Congo's production forests were managed by European (40%) and Asian (33%) companies. European concessions had the highest rates of total and core deforestation, followed by Asian concessions, indicating that the fragmentation of intact forests in Congo is strongly associated with industrial logging fueled by foreign capital. European concession holders were also far more likely to comply with SFM policies, followed by Asian concessions, suggesting that compliance with Sustainable Forest Management policies may not mitigate degradation in tropical production forests. Further evaluation of the relationship between investment source, regulatory compliance, and outcomes in tropical countries is essential for effective conservation of tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - Genetic Improvement and Crop Management Strategies to Minimize Yield Losses in Warm Non-traditional Wheat Growing Areas due to Spot Blotch Pathogen Cochliobolus sativus
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Spot blotch caused by Cochliobolus sativus emerged as a major threat to wheat production in the warmer non-traditional wheat growing areas in the late 1980s. This foliar disease causes significant yield losses annually (15-20% on average in South Asia) endangering the livelihoods of millions of small farmers. Effective measures in the field are needed to mitigate the impact of spot blotch on food security in affected areas. This review summarizes the global knowledge on genetic improvement and crop management strategies to minimize yield losses based on latest field research. Recent studies have shown that spot blotch severity is highly influenced by stress factors affecting crop physiology which in turn affects host tolerance and resistance to the pathogen. Soil nutrient and water stress aggravate spot blotch-induced grain yield losses. Heat stress which is gradually increasing in Asia causes higher levels of disease damage. Genetic improvement is the cornerstone of a sustainable control of spot blotch in all affected regions. Resistance is essentially based on Chinese and South American sources and inter-specific crosses with broadly adapted semi-dwarf germplasm. A list of genotypes consistently reported in the last 10 years to harbor at least partial resistance to spot blotch, along with their inheritance of resistance, has been compiled to help breeding programmes. As the fungus is aggressive under conditions of high relative humidity and heat which in turn influences plant susceptibility, a synthesis of the different tools for scoring disease severity is given. Because resistance is incomplete, the ultimate goal is the accumulation of minor genes of resistance in adapted high yielding genotypes. This paper shows how the use of resistant varieties, timely seeding, adequate fertilization, crop rotation, and the judicious use of fungicides can be part of an integrated management strategy for controlling yield losses due to spot blotch.

TI  - Evaluation of polarimetry and interferometry of sentinel-1A SAR data for land use and land cover of the Brazilian Amazon Region
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been an alternative for monitoring ground targets, especially in areas with cloud cover. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1A attributes for mapping land use and land cover (LULC) in a region of the Brazilian Amazon, using two different machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Different scenarios were used that combined backscattering, polarimetry, and interferometry to the classification process, which was divided into two phases to improve the results. The RF shows superiority over the SVM for almost all scenarios for the two phases of the mapping. The scenario with all data, presented the best results with both classifiers. The final maps with RF and SVM, obtained a global accuracy of 82.7% and 74.5%, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-1 to map LULC classes in the Amazon region using a classification in two phases.

TI  - Fate of methane in canals draining tropical peatlands
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetlands and freshwaters are major contributors to the growing atmospheric methane (CH4) burden. Extensive peatland drainage has lowered CH(4)emissions from peat soils in Southeast Asia, but the canals draining these peatlands may be hotspots of CH4 emissions. Alternatively, CH4 oxidation (consumption) by methanotrophic microorganisms may attenuate emissions. Here, we used laboratory experiments and a synoptic survey of the isotopic composition of CH4 in 34 canals across West Kalimantan, Indonesia to quantify the proportion of CH4 that is consumed and therefore not emitted to the atmosphere. We find that CH4 oxidation mitigates 76.4 +/- 12.0% of potential canal emissions, reducing emissions by similar to 70 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Methane consumption also significantly impacts the stable isotopic fingerprint of canal CH4 emissions. As canals drain over 65% of peatlands in Southeast Asia, our results suggest that CH4 oxidation significantly influences landscape-scale CH4 emissions from these ecosystems.

TI  - Bat phylogenetic responses to regenerating Amazonian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Throughout the tropics, regenerating secondary forests occupy vast areas previously cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. However, despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forest-associated biodiversity, longitudinal studies on species' phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare.2. We surveyed bats in continuous primary forest, primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a whole-ecosystem Amazonian fragmentation experiment, similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance, to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity.3.We found that temporal changes in phylogenetic alpha-richness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest, evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time. However, when the effects of species richness were accounted for, the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero, evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types. Temporal differences in phylogenetic beta-diversity were driven mainly by beta(replacement) in secondary forest and continuous forest similar to 30 years after forest clearance. Both habitats also clustered together in terms of beta(richness), indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage. Consequently, regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time.4. Synthesis and applications. Approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest. Promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration, while ensuring the long-term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age, is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services. Such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species, safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions. Our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law, especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover, and in the surroundings of protected areas.

TI  - Co-Creating Strategies to Optimize Traditional Silvopastoral Systems through the Management of Native Trees in Caivas in Southern Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of forest remnants in southern Brazil is closely related to historical land use, for example in systems such as ca & iacute;vas that occur within remnants of the Araucaria Forest and include livestock production and the extraction of yerba mate. Over the last decade, technologies adapted for these systems have been developed that promote a significant increase in animal productivity, without harming forest regeneration or the maintenance of the tree layer. However, the fertilization of pastures proposed in the technology has also promoted greater growth of native trees, with a consequent increase in shade levels. This, in turn, has affected the maintenance of pasture and yerba mate in the understory. Thus, this study sought to develop a methodology to adjust shade levels based on forest management that adheres to the limits permitted by current legislation. The objective was to evaluate the effect of tree management to maintain 50% shade levels on environmental indicators in a ca & iacute;va that has been implementing pasture improvement technology since 2013. Native tree management occurred in 2020 and 2022 and the results were compared with data from the floristic survey of the area carried out in 2013. The results indicate that although the adoption of forest management to adjust shade levels reduced the density of individuals, it did not affect forest diversity, nor the basal area of the ca & iacute;va tree layer. As such, it is possible to maintain pasture and yerba mate production in the area. Strategies like this are fundamental so that the forest landscape can continue to offer a source of production while also supporting environmental conservation.

TI  - Forest fragments, primary and secondary forests harbour similar arthropod assemblages after 40 years of landscape regeneration in the Central Amazon
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale deforestation leads to habitat loss and fragmentation with major consequences for biodiversity. However, the impacts of these environmental disturbances can be mitigated by forest regeneration. We evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and vegetation recovery on arthropod assemblages in human-modified landscapes in the Amazon. Arthropods were sampled in 10-ha forest fragments, continuous primary forests, and secondary forests using Malaise traps. We identified arthropods in multiple taxonomic resolutions from order to species. We collected 25,230 arthropods belonging to 17 orders. Coleoptera and Hemiptera were more abundant in secondary forests compared to other habitats. A dipteran family (Clusiidae) and a horse fly species (Dichelacera cervicornis-Tabanidae) were identified as indicators of forest fragments and continuous forests, respectively. Similar levels of taxonomic diversity between habitats were documented. The taxonomic composition also was similar between studied habitats in all taxonomic resolutions. Although the studied landscapes suffered strong environmental disturbances four decades ago, the vegetation has been in continuous regeneration since then, favouring the dispersal of arthropods throughout habitats. Forest fragments and old secondary forests contribute to the maintenance of a rich and diverse arthropod assemblage in landscapes composed of large tracts of continuous primary forests.

TI  - Ultrastructural and functional chloroplast changes promoting photoacclimation after forest management in a tropical secondary forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management involving the selective logging of exotic species in order to reestablish native flora alters microclimatic conditions and selects for species with heightened capacity to adapt to the new conditions. This study investigated whether, after forest management involving the removal of eucalyptus, ultrastructural adjustments in the chloroplast fostered the photoacclimation of the most abundant regenerating native species in a Brazilian Atlantic forest biological reserve. The influence of seasonality on photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency after the forest management was also assessed. To achieve this, in the rainy season mature leaves of native tree saplings (Xylopia sericea, Siparuna guianensis, and Byrsonima sericea) were subjected to ultrastructural analyses and the C isotopic composition (delta C-13) was determined; and in the dry and rainy season gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured. Species samples were obtained in: secondary forest, a eucalyptus understory with 15 years of regeneration before and 12 months after the management, and from herbarium samples from eucalyptus understories collected at the beginning of forest regeneration (9-16 years ago, for delta C-13 analyses only). Ultrastructural alterations such as the reorganization of thylakoids, starch grain changes, and the presence of plastoglobules and oils were verified after the management in all the species. F-v/F-m, values varied between 0.80 and 0.90 regardless of the management or season of the year. There was a reduction of C assimilation after the management, especially in the dry season. C-13 enrichment was observed for B. sericea, S. guianensis, and X. sericea in herbarium samples (-31.4 parts per thousand, -32.0 parts per thousand, and -31.4 parts per thousand, respectively) and after the forest management (-31.2 parts per thousand, -32.5 parts per thousand, -31.4 parts per thousand), while samples depleted in 13C were registered before the management (-33.4 parts per thousand, -33.3 parts per thousand, -33.2 parts per thousand) and in the secondary forest (-34.0 parts per thousand, -33.9 parts per thousand, and -33.6 parts per thousand). The data suggest that ultrastructural alterations may have aided in maintaining electron flow after the increase in irradiance due to the forest management, avoiding photochemical stress, as evidenced by Fv/Fm values. The forest management increased the efficiency of water use and fostered abiotic conditions similar to those present at the beginning of the understory regeneration. These previous conditions favored the current high level of abundance of these three species, highlighting the importance of monitoring to ensure that the management practices do not promote the future dominance of few species at the expense this biome's high biodiversity.

TI  - Changes in Soil Physical and Chemical Properties in Long Lerm Improved Natural and Traditional Agroforestry Management Systems of Cacao Genotypes in Peruvian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) in an agroforestry system generates a productive use of the land, preserves the best conditions for physical, chemical and biological properties of tropical soils, and plays an important role in improving cacao production and fertility of degraded tropical soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two long term agroforestry systems of cacao management on soil physical and chemical properties in an area originally inhabited by 30 years old native secondary forest (SF). The two agroforestry systems adapted were: improved natural agroforestry system (INAS) where trees without economic value were selectively removed to provide 50% shade and improved traditional agroforestry system (ITAS) where all native trees were cut and burnt in the location. For evaluation of the changes of soil physical and chemical properties with time due to the imposed cacao management systems, plots of 10 cacao genotypes (ICS95, UF613, CCN51, ICT1112, ICT1026, ICT2162, ICT2171, ICT2142, H35, U30) and one plot with a spontaneous hybrid were selected. Soil samples were taken at 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depths before the installation of the management systems (2004), and then followed at two years intervals. Bulk density, porosity, field capacity and wilting point varied significantly during the years of assessment in the different soil depths and under the systems assessed. Soil pH, CEC, exchangeable Mg and sum of the bases were higher in the INAS than the ITAS. In both systems, SOM, Ext. P, K and Fe, exch. K, Mg and Al+H decreased with years of cultivation; these changes were more evident in the 0-20 cm soil depth. Overall improvement of SOM and soil nutrient status was much higher in the ITAS than INAS. The levels of physical and chemical properties of soil under cacao genotypes showed a marked difference in both systems.

TI  - Denitrification and associated nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions from the Amazonian wetlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we quantify the CO2 and N2O emissions from denitrification over the Amazonian wetlands. The study concerns the entire Amazonian wetland ecosystem with a specific focus on three floodplain (FP) locations: the Branco FP, the Madeira FP and the FP alongside the Amazon River. We adapted a simple denitrification model to the case of tropical wetlands and forced it by open water surface extent products from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. A priori model parameters were provided by in situ observations and gauging stations from the HYBAM Observatory. Our results show that the denitrification and the trace gas emissions present a strong cyclic pattern linked to the inundation processes that can be divided into three distinct phases: activation, stabilization and deactivation. We quantify the average yearly denitrification and associated emissions of CO2 and N2O over the entire watershed at 17.8 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) , 0.37 gC-CO2 M(-2 )yr(-1) and 0.18 gN-N2O M-2 yr(-1) respectively for the period 2011-2015. When compared to local observations, it was found that the CO(2)emissions accounted for 0.01 % of the integrated ecosystem, which emphasizes the fact that minor changes to the land cover may induce strong impacts on the Amazonian carbon budget. Our results are consistent with the state of the art of global nitrogen models with a positive bias of 28 %.When compared to other wetlands in different pedoclimatic environments we found that the Amazonian wetlands have similar emissions of N2O with the Congo tropical wetlands and lower emissions than the temperate and tropical anthropogenic wetlands of the Garonne (France), the Rhine (Europe) and south-eastern Asia rice paddies. In summary our paper shows that a data-model-based approach can be successfully applied to quantify N2O and CO(2)fluxes associated with denitrification over the Amazon basin. In the future, the use of higher-resolution remote sensing products from sensor fusion or new sensors like the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will permit the transposition of the approach to other large-scale watersheds in tropical environments.

TI  - Will funding to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and (forest) Degradation (REDD+) stop conversion of peat swamps to oil palm in orangutan habitat in Tripa in Aceh, Indonesia?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a potentially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54 % in 1995, 18 % in 2009) while oil palm increased 4-39 %. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha(-1) in 1990 to 61 Mg ha(-1) in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO(2)e ha(-1) year(-1). While 41 % of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO(2)e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy.

Monitoring is required in the region to support the conservation of water resources and biodiversity. The developed approach, random forest database unmixing (RFDBUX), makes use of pixel-based random forest regression to overcome the limitations of the existing lookup-table-based approach (DBUX). The RFDBUX approach with passive microwave data (AMSR2) and active microwave data (PALSAR-2) was used from 2012 to 2017 in order to obtain PALSAR-2-like images with a 100 m spatial resolution and three-day temporal resolution. In addition, a thresholding approach for the obtained PALSAR-2-like backscatter coefficient images provided water body extent maps. The validation revealed that the spatial patterns of the images predicted by RFDBUX are consistent with the original PALSAR-2 backscatter coefficient images (r = 0.94, RMSE = 1.04 in average), and that the temporal pattern of the predicted water body extent can track the wetland dynamics. The PALSAR-2-like images should be a useful basis for further investigation of the hydrological/climatological features of the site, and the proposed approach appears to have the potential for application in other tropical regions worldwide.

TI  - Habitat modification and seasonality influence avian haemosporidian parasite distributions in southeastern Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat modification may change vertebrate and vector-borne disease distributions. However, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession may mitigate these effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that secondary succession influences the distribution of birds and their haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in a seasonally dry tropical forest, a globally threatened ecosystem, in Brazil. Moreover, we assessed seasonal fluctuations in parasite prevalence and distribution. We sampled birds in four different successional stages at the peak and end of the rainy season, as well as in the middle and at the end of the dry season. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that bird communities in the pasture (i.e., highly modified) areas were different from those in the early, intermediate, and late successional areas (secondary forests). Among 461 individual birds, haemosporidian prevalence was higher in pasture areas than in the more advanced successional stages, but parasite communities were homogeneous across these areas. Parasite prevalence was higher in pasture-specialists birds (resilient species) than in forest-specialists species, suggesting that pasture-specialists may increase infection risk for co-occurring hosts. We found an increase in prevalence between the middle and end of the dry season, a period associated with the beginning of the breeding season (early spring) in southeastern Brazil. We also found effects of seasonality in the relative prevalence of specific parasite lineages. Our results show that natural forest recovery through secondary succession in SDTFs is associated with compositional differences in avian communities, and that advanced successional stages are associated with lower prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites.

TI  - Trees are major conduits for methane egress from tropical forested wetlands
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are the largest source of methane to the atmosphere, with tropical wetlands comprising the most significant global wetland source component. The stems of some wetland-adapted tree species are known to facilitate egress of methane from anoxic soil, but current ground-based flux chamber methods for determining methane inventories in forested wetlands neglect this emission pathway, and consequently, the contribution of tree-mediated emissions to total ecosystem methane flux remains unknown.In this study, we quantify in situ methane emissions from tree stems, peatland surfaces (ponded hollows and hummocks) and root-aerating pneumatophores in a tropical forested peatland in Southeast Asia.We show that tree stems emit substantially more methane than peat surfaces, accounting for 62-87% of total ecosystem methane flux. Tree stem flux strength was controlled by the stem diameter, wood specific density and the amount of methane dissolved in pore water.Our findings highlight the need to integrate this emission pathway in both field studies and models if wetland methane fluxes are to be characterized accurately in global methane budgets, and the discrepancies that exist between field-based flux inventories and top-down estimates of methane emissions from tropical areas are to be reconciled.

TI  - Impact of organic mulch and exposure to shallow groundwater levels on Cnidoscolus aconitifolius in a tropical wetland, South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - Lilloa
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land in Indonesia is decreasing due to its conversion for various non-agricultural interests, which are economically more profitable. The remaining land available for agricultural activities is a suboptimal wetland. The reduction in cultivable areas has led to the evaluation of alternative crops in suboptimal land conditions. Chaya ( Cnidoscolus aconitifolius) is a fast-growing perennial plant, its leaves are edible and rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. However, the chaya plant has not been intensively tested for its adaptation to shallow groundwater tables in tropical lowlands. This study aimed to assess chaya's adaptability to shallow groundwater table conditions and the benefits of using organic mulch. This research consisted of two separate parts, one part was related to organic mulch benefits (planting media without watering, with organic mulch but not watered, and with organic mulch and watering), while the other one was related to shallow groundwater table tolerance. The study followed a randomized complete block design consisting of three replications. Results showed that chaya plants negatively responded to the shallow groundwater table conditions. Growth retardation due to shallow groundwater levels is reflected in the averages of leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, canopy diameter, and canopy area; fresh and dry weight of stem, petiole, and leaf blade; development of roots; SPAD value at 7 weeks after transplanting and it was based on visual appearance. However, despite the increase in substrate humidity due to the application of organic mulch, the effects were not significant on most of the measured morphological traits. In conclusion, chaya plants are not able to adapt to shallow groundwater levels and do not require organic mulch on the soil surface.

TI  - Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forest regrowth is considered the most cost-effective strategy to promote large-scale forest restoration, but regrowth trajectories and their consequences for nature and people can be highly variable. This uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 x 4 km agricultural landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial dynamics of second growth forests. Our results showed negative effects of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100-150 years, tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.

TI  - Landcover classification of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands using ALOS/PALSAR, RADARSAT-2 and ENVISAT/ASAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal is part of a large continuous tropical wetland that exhibits a high biodiversity of flora and fauna species, and many threatened habitats. The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Different physiological stages and breeding systems related to the variability of meat quality of indigenous Pantaneiro sheep
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study configures a first report regarding the variability of meat quality of locally adapted Pantaneiro sheep depending on different physiological stages and breeding systems. Pantaneiro sheep are raised in Brazil under a tropical wetland ecosystem denominated Pantanal. Twenty-nine Pantaneiro sheep from different sex and physiological stages were sorted into three groups, simulating three of the most representative ovine meat products commercialized by South American industries: a) non castrated male lambs (n = 11); b) wethers (n = 9); c) cull ewes (n = 9). Animals from each physiological stage were submitted to different breeding systems, resembling farming strategies adopted in several developing countries of South America. The effect of physiological stages on the quality of meat was accessed using 16 variables measured in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LM) and the semimembranosus (SM) muscles. The variables were related to brightness, color, physical aspects, soluble and total collagen as well as chemical traits. The physiological stage was defined as a classification variable in order to proceed ANOVA tests and comparison of means (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis was used to identify patterns of similarity and differentiation between samples of different physiological stages (a, b, c). The results revealed that meat quality varies according to different physiological stages, especially between lambs (a) and cull ewes (c). As a consequence, the physiological stage at slaughter should be taken into consideration to cote the quality of meat from indigenous sheep raised in tropical regions. The results contribute towards sensorial evaluation and the characterization of potential food products derived from indigenous sheep bred under tropical climate in developing countries.

TI  - IMPACT OF Bambusa tuldoides MUNRO (POACEAE) ON FOREST REGENERATION
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo grove may cause changes in the structure and floristic composition of natural regeneration. This study evaluated the impact caused by Bambusa tuldoides Munro at natural regeneration, in riparian forest in Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Two areas were evaluated: riparian forest without bamboos (SB) as the reference area, and riparian forest dominated by Bambusa tuldoides (CB). In 2014, ten plots (10x10 m) were installed in each area. All individuals belonging to classes I (30 <= H < 130 cm) and II ( CBH <= 5 cm) were measured and identified. Floristic composition, phytosociological indexes, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness, Simpson dominance, Sorensen similarity, and cluster analysis by Twinspan were evaluated. Richness and absolute density decreased in CB compared to SB. The areas presented low floristic similarity, and high dominance of one or more species in both classes. Myrtaceae was the predominant botanic family in SB, especially Campomanesia xanthocarpa. In CB most species were secondary, as Myrsine umbellata, Cupania vernalis, and Ocotea puberula. Due to the large differences between SB and CB, the groups formed were restricted mostly to the species of each area. Species such as Myrsine umbellata (class I and II) and Strichnos brasiliensis (class II) appear as indicators and former of groups in CB. We concluded that high density of Bambusa tuldoides affect the richness and diversity of regeneration natural, changing the establishment and perpetuation of the species. Secondary species show greater potential for adaptation to these environments and can act as key species in management and recovery actions.

TI  - Methanogenesis and methane oxidation in wetlands. Implications in the global carbon cycle
T2  - Hidrobiologica
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems on the Earth. They are distinguished by the presence of water, saturated anoxic soils, and different kinds of vegetation adapted to this conditions. Organic matter in these environments is mineralized mainly in the sediments throughout anaerobic processes where sulfate reduction is one of the most important terminal stages of anaerobic decomposition in coastal wetlands, whereas methanogenesis is important in freshwater wetlands.In this environments, methane, a greenhouse gas, is produced as a result of the activity of a large and diverse group of methanogenic bacteria (Domain Archaea). The generated methane can be diffused to the atmosphere or can be oxidized by several microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, such microorganisms intercept and consume this gas diminishing its emission to the atmosphere.The production and consumption of methane in wetlands involve complex physiological processes of plants and microorganisms, which are regulated by climatic and edaphic factors, mainly soil temperature and water table level. The interaction of these processes with heterogeneous environments results in large variations in the methane fluxes.Because methane is an important gas that contribute with as much as 15% to the greenhouse effect, several studies had analyzed methane production and its emission from wetlands. These studies established that natural and agricultural freshwater wetlands represent approximately 40% of the sources of atmospheric methane. However, most of the ecological studies assessing the production, consumption, and emission of methane have been performed in boreal and temperate wetlands, yet there are few studies evaluating these activities in tropical wetlands, particularly in Brazil and Panama. In Mexico there are not studies contributing to this respect.

TI  - Physiological responses to extreme hydrological events in the Pantanal wetland: heterogeneity of a plant community containing super-dominant species
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsWe tested two mechanisms of adaptation to extreme hydrological stresses (flooding and drought) of species making up a tropical wetland plant community by measuring leaf gas exchange and water potential. We hypothesized that anoxic conditions that occur during flooding will decrease leaf gas exchange when compared to the dry season, and that super-dominant' species will have a distinctive physiological advantage when compared to other plants within the community.LocationNorthern Pantanal wetland, Private Natural Heritage Reserve of the Brazilian Social Service of Commerce (RPPN-SESC Pantanal), Mato Grosso, Brazil.MethodsTwo periods representing typical extreme hydrological conditions in the Pantanal wetland were selected based on historical soil and meteorological measurements: (1) a drought period when plants experience stress due to soil moisture deficits during a dry season that persists for several months (May to Sept), and (2) a flooding period when oxidation-reduction potential is negative for 30d or more (Mar or Apr), indicating anoxic stress. Measurements of gas exchange and leaf water potential were made on seven species in drought and flood stress conditions. The seven species represent the majority of the plant community.ResultsAs a whole, the plant community showed significantly lower potential net photosynthesis (P-N) during flooding when soil oxidation-reduction potential reached close to -900 mV when compared to the dry season, but the magnitude of the decline in P-N was species specific. Not all super-dominant species showed higher P-N compared to non-dominant species, but they did demonstrate higher stomatal conductance and transpiration leading to lower water use efficiency. The combination of higher P-N despite low soil water content suggests that the plant community had access to deep water resources. This access was also confirmed by the midday leaf water potential, which was similar for the flood and dry seasons.ConclusionsResults suggest that the plant community may have high physiological performance under a wide range of soil oxidation-reduction potentials. Higher P-N rates of super-dominant species indicate a physiological advantage of these species in the different hydrological conditions.

TI  - Flooding and fire frequency promotes beta diversity in tree and non-tree species in tropical wetlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between high fire frequency and long flooding seasons maintains open vegetation in floodplains, while low fire frequency and no flooding can lead to forest development. In the Kadiwe<acute accent>u Indigenous Territory (IT), in the ecotone between the Cerrado and the Pantanal biomes in Brazil, the diversified spatio-temporal patterns of fire activity affect the diversity of floral functional traits and plant phenological strategies. Given this scenario, we sampled tree and non-tree species abundance data in 156 plots subject to different flood levels and fire frequencies in the Kadiwe<acute accent>u IT. Based on flooding regimes and fire frequency data series from 2001 to 2021, we classify the sample sites as floodable or flood-free areas under high (annual or biennial burn), moderate (three-yearly burn), or low (burning at four-year intervals or more) fire frequency. We analyzed the effects of flooding and fire frequency on plant species richness, abundance, and beta diversity (beta). In general, tree density did not affect non-tree species richness. The species richness on the patches with different fire frequency category was generally similar, especially regarding the tree species. However, the combined effect of fire and flooding shifted the species composition. Variability in fire frequency across the landscapes support beta-diversity maintenance in ecotonal vegetation between tropical wetlands and savannas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between floodable and flood-free areas at the same fire frequency category is low due to differences in abundance and species replacement. As part of adaptive fire management, we suggest maintaining a heterogeneous mosaic of fire frequencies in the landscape.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping spatial distributions of tropical peatlands is important for properly estimating carbon emissions and for providing information that aids in the sustainable management of tropical peatlands, particularly in Indonesia. This study evaluated the performance of phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (PALSAR) dual-polarization and fully polarimetric data for tropical peatlands classification. The study area was in Siak River Transect, Riau Province, Indonesia, a rapidly developing region, where the peatland has been intensively converted mostly into oil palm plantations over the last two decades. Thus, polarimetric features derived after polarimetric decompositions, backscatter coefficients measurements, and the radar vegetation index were evaluated to classify tropical peatlands using the decision tree classifier. Overall, polarimetric features generated by the combination of dual-polarization and fully polarimetric data yielded an overall accuracy (OA) of 69% and a kappa coefficient (K) of 0.57. The integration of an additional feature, "distance to river," to the algorithm increased the OA to 76% and K to 0.66. These results indicated that the methodology in this study might serve as an efficient tool in tropical peatlands classification, especially when involving the use of L-band SAR dual-polarization and fully polarimetric data.

TI  - Potential of soil moisture retrieval for tropical peatlands in Indonesia using ALOS-2 L-band full-polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a soil moisture retrieval from full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is investigated for sparsely vegetated soil surfaces. An improved retrieval method adapting the variations in vegetation is proposed by incorporating the generalized volume model into the polarimetric two-scale two-component model (PTSTCM). The feasibility of the method, termed as the adaptive PTSTCM, has been tested for tropical peatland sites in Indonesia which exhibit a variety of sparse vegetation cover on soil after land clearing activities. The data were collected in March and August 2017 with the time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe for a total of 18 sample points over 11 regions. The method was applied to ALOS-2 L-band quad-pol SAR data that were acquired simultaneously with field measurements. We compared the results between the proposed adaptive PTSTCM and the original PTSTCM that utilizes specific types of volume model (i.e., randomly, horizontally, and vertically oriented volume models). Scatterplots of estimated versus measured results reveal that the adaptive PTSTCM yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.1vol. and inversion rate of 35.0 and 58.5 for March and August data, respectively, which are found to be superior to those of the original PTSTCM.

AB  - Peatland restoration is considered as one of the most cost-effective interventions for climate mitigation and adaptation, sustaining local welfare and livelihoods, and building climate resilience of local communities. Yet, there is often a diversity of views and goals of restoring tropical peatlands. While technical approaches dominate peatland restoration literature, this study introduces a novel social-ecological framework that analyzed the value-driven priorities that shape restoration goals. Based on semi-structured interviews with 14 key informants and six focus groups with development agencies, local governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities, participants highlight key issues in restoring peatlands, often influenced by the socioeconomic and historical context in which they are positioned. These results exemplify specific objectives for restoration in developing countries with relatively smaller yet equally important peatlands. The study's novelty lies in applying sense-making and value-centric approaches to tropical peatland restoration, contributing to discourse by demonstrating how diverse social perspectives and values critically shape restoration outcomes, an underrepresented dimension in predominantly technical restoration literature.

TI  - Photosynthetic light and carbon dioxide response of the invasive tree, Vochysia divergens Pohl, to experimental flooding and shading
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vochysia divergens Pohl is considered to be a flood-adapted, light-demanding pioneer species that has been invading grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal. In these areas, a successful invasion requires an ability to tolerate physiologically wide fluctuations in surface hydrology and shading induced by a dense cover of grasses and other vegetation. We evaluated how flooding and shading affected the photosynthetic performance of V. divergens saplings by measuring light-saturated gas exchange (net photosynthetic rate, P (N); stomatal conductance, g (s)), and intercellular CO2 (P (N)/C (i)) and photosynthetic photon flux density (P (N)/PPFD) response curves over a 61-d field experiment. Shading and flooding reduced significantly light-saturated P (N) and g (s) and affected multiple aspects of the leaf gas exchange response of V. divergens to variations in PPFD and CO2. Flooding influenced the physiology of this species more than shading. Given the success of V. divergens at invading and expanding in seasonally flooded areas of the Pantanal, the results were surprising and highlighted the physiological ability of this species to tolerate suboptimal conditions. However, the consistently higher light-saturated P (N) and g (s) under nonflooded conditions suggested that the invasive success of V. divergens might not be related to its physiological potential during flooding, but to situations, when flooding recedes during the dry season and soil water availability is adequate.

TI  - PolyWaTT: A polynomial water travel time estimator based on Derivative Dynamic Time Warping and Perceptually Important Points
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods for estimating timing parameters in hydrological science require a rigorous study of the relations of flow resistance, slope, flow regime, watershed size, water velocity, and other local variables. These studies are mostly based on empirical observations, where the timing parameter is estimated using empirically derived formulas. The application of these studies to other locations is not always direct. The locations in which equations are used should have comparable characteristics to the locations from which such equations have been derived. To overcome this barrier, in this work, we developed a data-driven approach to estimate timing parameters such as travel time. Our proposal estimates timing parameters using historical data of the location without the need of adapting or using empirical formulas from other locations. The proposal only uses one variable measured at two different locations on the same river (for instance, two river-level measurements, one upstream and the other downstream on the same river). The recorded data from each location generates two time series. Our method aligns these two time series using derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and perceptually important points (PIP). Using data from timing parameters, a polynomial function generalizes the data by inducing a polynomial water travel time estimator, called PolyWaTT. To evaluate the potential of our proposal, we applied PolyWaTT to three different watersheds: a floodplain ecosystem located in the part of Brazil known as Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area; and the Missouri River and the Pearl River, in United States of America. We compared our proposal with empirical formulas and a data-driven state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyWaTT showed a lower mean absolute error than all other methods tested in this study, and for longer distances the mean absolute error achieved by PolyWaTT is three times smaller than empirical formulas.

TI  - The Impact of Rewetting Peatland on Fire Hazard in Riau, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rewetting peatland is an ongoing effort in Indonesia to restore the hydrological cycle and carbon balance of the ecosystem. However, quantifying the impact of rewetting on mitigating fire remains a challenge. Here, we assess the impact of large-scale rewetting on fire risks and occurrences (duration, coverage area, and the number of events) in 2015-2021. The weather research and forecasting (WRF) model was integrated with a drought-fire model to spatially quantify fire hazards in Riau, Sumatra. The results show that rewetting has resulted in decreasing the frequency of extreme events in the study area (pre- and post-rewetting, respectively, were seven and four events). Although the area influenced by extreme events reduced following rewetting by 5%, the mean duration of extreme events increased. Our findings reveal that widespread prolonged extreme fire hazards only occurred during drying El Nino events in 2015 and 2019. The findings obtained in this case study provide quantitative evidence of the reduced fire hazard resulting from peat restoration in Indonesia. Further, the findings assist in assessing the success of peatland restoration programs and improve our knowledge of the ability to monitor and forecast fire risks in tropical peatlands.

TI  - First Evidence of Peat Domes in the Congo Basin using LiDAR from a Fixed-Wing Drone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's most extensive tropical peatlands occur in the Cuvette Centrale depression in the Congo Basin, which stores 30.6 petagrams of carbon (95% CI, 6.3-46.8). Improving our understanding of the genesis, development and functioning of these under-studied peatlands requires knowledge of their topography and, in particular, whether the peat surface is domed, as this implies a rain-fed system. Here we use a laser altimeter mounted on an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) to measure peat surface elevation along two transects at the edges of a peatland, in the northern Republic of Congo, to centimetre accuracy and compare the results with an analysis of nearby satellite LiDAR data (ICESat and ICESat-2). The LiDAR elevations on both transects show an upward slope from the peatland edge, suggesting a surface elevation peak of around 1.8 m over similar to 20 km. While modest, this domed shape is consistent with the peatland being rainfed. In-situ peat depth measurements and our LiDAR results indicate that this peatland likely formed at least 10,000 years BP in a large shallow basin similar to 40 km wide and similar to 3 m deep.

AB  - This article describes daily groundwater depth data of peat-lands in Indonesia. The data were recorded from eight insitu stations spread over two peatland regions in Indonesia, namely Batanghari and Kubu Raya in Sumatra and Kalimantan. This article also presents experimental data describing soil water retention in the region. Water retention of peats determines the groundwater table's contribution to rewetting the soil surface. The datasets represent peatlands utilized for agriculture. Furthermore, the groundwater table of peatlands is a key variable controlling peat fire vulnerability, as described in the research article entitled `An improved drought-fire assessment for managing fire risks in tropical peatlands' Taufik et al. (2022) and assessing the success of peat restoration projects. The groundwater datasets can be used as a benchmark for studies on modeling of hydrology and peat fire mitigation action.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as cost-effective, high-resolution alternatives to satellites for the environmental monitoring of large areas. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using UAV-acquired soil surface temperature to monitor groundwater level in a peatland undergoing groundwater restoration to mitigate fire risk (Tanjung Leban, Indonesia). We used two UAVs (Inspire 1, with an infrared camera, and Phantom 4) to map soil surface temperatures at 459 points on bare land. Using a spline analysis of groundwater-level and elevation data in Arc GIS 10.6, we produced ground elevation and groundwater table maps and measured the groundwater level (depth from the ground surface) at each bare-land point. Spearman's rank correlation analysis determined a negative correlation between the soil surface temperature and groundwater level. Our study shows that soil surface temperature is a reliable proxy for groundwater level in tropical peatlands. This proxy can be monitored cost-effectively using UAVs equipped with infrared cameras.

TI  - Detection and Characterization of Low Temperature Peat Fires during the 2015 Fire Catastrophe in Indonesia Using a New High-Sensitivity Fire Monitoring Satellite Sensor (FireBird)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast and disastrous fires occurred on Borneo during the 2015 dry season, pushing Indonesia into the top five carbon emitting countries. The region was affected by a very strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon, on par with the last severe event in 1997/98. Fire dynamics in Central Kalimantan were investigated using an innovative sensor offering higher sensitivity to a wider range of fire intensities at a finer spatial resolution (160 m) than heretofore available. The sensor is onboard the TET-1 satellite, part of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) FireBird mission. TET-1 images (acquired every 2-3 days) from the middle infrared were used to detect fires continuously burning for almost three weeks in the protected peatlands of Sebangau National Park as well as surrounding areas with active logging and oil palm concessions. TET-1 detection capabilities were compared with MODIS active fire detection and Landsat burned area algorithms. Fire dynamics, including fire front propagation speed and area burned, were investigated. We show that TET-1 has improved detection capabilities over MODIS in monitoring low-intensity peatland fire fronts through thick smoke and haze. Analysis of fire dynamics revealed that the largest burned areas resulted from fire front lines started from multiple locations, and the highest propagation speeds were in excess of 500 m/day (all over peat > 2m deep). Fires were found to occur most often in concessions that contained drainage infrastructure but were not cleared prior to the fire season. Benefits of implementing this sensor system to improve current fire management techniques are discussed. Near real-time fire detection together with enhanced fire behavior monitoring capabilities would not only improve firefighting efforts, but also benefit analysis of fire impact on tropical peatlands, greenhouse gas emission estimations as well as mitigation measures to reduce severe fire events in the future.

TI  - InSAR Time Series Analysis of L-Band Data for Understanding Tropical Peatland Degradation and Restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite radar observations are employed to reveal spatiotemporal changes in ground surface height of peatlands that have, and have not, undergone restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our time series analysis of 26 scenes of Advanced Land Observation Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic-Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired between 2006 and 2010 suggests that peatland restoration was positively affected by the construction time of dams-the earlier the dam was constructed, the more significant the restoration appears. The results also suggest that the dams resulted in an increase of ground water level, which in turn stopped peat losing height. For peatland areas without restoration, the peatland continuously lost peat height by up to 7.7 cm/yr. InSAR-derived peat height changes allow the investigation of restoration effects over a wide area and can also be used to indirectly assess the relative magnitude and spatial pattern of peatland damage caused by drainage and fires. Such an assessment can provide key information for guiding future restoration activities.

TI  - Tropical Peatland Hydrology Simulated With a Global Land Surface Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth, and their water storage dynamics strongly control these carbon stocks. The hydrological functioning of tropical peatlands differs from that of northern peatlands, which has not yet been accounted for in global land surface models (LSMs). Here, we integrated tropical peat-specific hydrology modules into a global LSM for the first time, by utilizing the peatland-specific model structure adaptation (PEATCLSM) of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM). We developed literature-based parameter sets for natural (PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat)) and drained (PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain)) tropical peatlands. Simulations with PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) were compared against those with the default CLSM version and the northern version of PEATCLSM (PEATCLSM(North,Nat)) with tropical vegetation input. All simulations were forced with global meteorological reanalysis input data for the major tropical peatland regions in Central and South America, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. The evaluation against a unique and extensive data set of in situ water level and eddy covariance-derived evapotranspiration showed an overall improvement in bias and correlation compared to the default CLSM version. Over Southeast Asia, an additional simulation with PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain) was run to address the large fraction of drained tropical peatlands in this region. PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain) outperformed CLSM, PEATCLSM(North,Nat), and PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) over drained sites. Despite the overall improvements of PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) over CLSM, there are strong differences in performance between the three study regions. We attribute these performance differences to regional differences in accuracy of meteorological forcing data, and differences in peatland hydrologic response that are not yet captured by our model.

TI  - Tropical peat subsidence rates are related to decadal LULC changes: Insights from InSAR analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are subject to subsidence in recent years, resulting in significant soil organic carbon loss. Their degradation is responsible for several environmental issues; however, understanding the causes of peatland subsidence is of prime concern for implementing mitigation measures. Here, we employed time-series Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using ALOS PALSAR-2 images to assess the relationship between subsidence rates and land use/land cover (LULC) change (including drainage periods) derived from decadal Landsat data (1972-2019). Overall, the study area subsided with a mean rate of -2.646 +/- 1.839 cm/year in 2018-2019. The subsidence rates slowed over time, with significant subsidence decreases in peatlands after being drained for 9 years. We found that the long-time persistence of vegetated areas leads to subsidence deceleration. The relatively lower subsidence rates are in areas that changed to rubber/mixed plantations. Further, the potential of subsidence prediction was assessed using Random Forest (RF) regression based on LULC change, distance from peat edge, and elevation. With an R-2 of 0.532 (RMSE = 0.594 cm/year), this machine learning method potentially enlarges the spatial coverage of InSAR method for the higher frequency SAR data (such as Sentinel-1) that mainly have limited coverage due to decorrelation in vegetated areas. According to feature importance in the RF model, the contribution of LULC change (including drainage period) to the subsidence model is comparable with distance from peat edge and elevation. Other uncertainties are from unexplained factors related to drainage and peat condition, which need to be accounted for as well. This work shows the significance of decadal LULC change analysis to supplement InSAR measurement in tropical peatland subsidence monitoring programs.

TI  - Anthropogenic impacts on lowland tropical peatland biogeochemistry
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical peatlands hold around 105 gigatonnes of carbon but are increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities. This Review describes the biogeochemistry of these systems and how deforestation, fire, drainage and agriculture are disturbing them.Tropical peatlands store around one-sixth of the global peatland carbon pool (105 gigatonnes), equivalent to 30% of the carbon held in rainforest vegetation. Deforestation, drainage, fire and conversion to agricultural land threaten these ecosystems and their role in carbon sequestration. In this Review, we discuss the biogeochemistry of tropical peatlands and the impacts of ongoing anthropogenic modifications. Extensive peatlands are found in Southeast Asia, the Congo Basin and Amazonia, but their total global area remains unknown owing to inadequate data. Anthropogenic transformations result in high carbon loss and reduced carbon storage, increased greenhouse gas emissions, loss of hydrological integrity and peat subsidence accompanied by an enhanced risk of flooding. Moreover, the resulting nutrient storage and cycling changes necessitate fertilizer inputs to sustain crop production, further disturbing the ecosystem and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under a warming climate, these impacts are likely to intensify, with both disturbed and intact peat swamps at risk of losing 20% of current carbon stocks by 2100. Improved measurement and observation of carbon pools and fluxes, along with process-based biogeochemical knowledge, is needed to support management strategies, protect tropical peatland carbon stocks and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Adaptive High Coherence Temporal Subsets SBAS-InSAR in Tropical Peatlands Degradation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been undergoing extensive and rapid degradation in recent years. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has shown excellent performance in monitoring surface deformation. However, due to the characteristics of high vegetation cover and large dynamic changes in peatlands, it is difficult for classical InSAR technology to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, an adaptive high coherence temporal subsets (HCTSs) small baseline subset (SBAS)-InSAR method is proposed in this paper, which captures the high coherence time range of pixels to establish adaptive temporal subsets and calculates the deformation results in corresponding time intervals, combining with the time-weighted strategy. Ninety Sentinel-1 SAR images (2019-2022) in South Sumatra province were processed based on the proposed method. The results showed that the average deformation rate of peatlands ranged from approximately -567 to 347 mm/year and was affected by fires and the changes in land cover. Besides, the dynamic changes of peatlands' deformation rate a long time after fires were revealed, and the causes of changes were analyzed. Furthermore, the deformation results of the proposed method observed 2 to 127 times as many measurement points as the SBAS-InSAR method. Pearson's r (ranged from 0.44 to 0.75) and Root Mean Square Error (ranged from 50 to 75 mm/year) were calculated to verify the reliability of the proposed method. Adaptive HCTSs SBAS-InSAR can be considered an efficient method for peatland degradation monitoring, which provides the foundation for investigating the mechanisms of peatland degradation and monitoring it in broader regions.

TI  - A process-based model for quantifying the effects of canal blocking on water table and CO2 emissions in tropical peatlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage in tropical peatlands increases CO2 emissions, the rate of subsidence, and the risk of forest fires. To a certain extent, these effects can be mitigated by raising the water table depth (WTD) using canal or ditch blocks. The performance of canal blocks in raising WTD is, however, poorly understood because the WTD monitoring data are limited and spatially concentrated around canals and canal blocks. This raises the following question: how effective are canal blocks in raising the WTD over large areas? In this work, we composed a process-based hydrological model to assess the peatland restoration performance of 168 canal blocks in a 22 000 ha peatland area in Sumatra, Indonesia. We simulated daily WTD over 1 year using an existing canal block setup and compared it to the situation without blocks. The study was performed across two contrasting weather scenarios representing dry (1997) and wet (2013) years. Our simulations revealed that, while canal blocks had a net positive impact on WTD rise, they lowered WTD in some areas, and the extent of their effect over 1 year was limited to a distance of about 600 m around the canals. We also show that canal blocks are most effective in peatlands with high hydraulic conductivity. Averaging over all modeled scenarios, blocks raised the annual mean WTD by only 1.5 cm. This value was similar in the dry (1.44 cm) and wet (1.57 cm) years, and there was a 2.13 fold difference between the scenarios with large and small hydraulic conductivities (2.05 cm versus 0.96 cm). Using a linear relationship between WTD and CO2 emissions, we estimated that, averaging over peat hydraulic properties, canal blocks prevented the emission of 1.07 Mgha(-1) CO2 in the dry year and 1.17 Mgha(-1) CO2 in the wet year. We believe that the modeling tools developed in this work could be adopted by local stakeholders aiming at a more effective and evidence-based approach to canal-block-based peatland restoration.

TI  - C-Band Dual-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Application for Peat Depth Classification: A Case Study in Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of peat depth distribution is vitally important for accurately estimating carbon stock within tropical peatlands. These estimates aid in understanding the role of tropical peatlands in global environmental change processes. This study evaluates the potential of C-band dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for peat depth classification on oil palm plantations in Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia. Specifically, features derived after the ground-range radar cross section (sigma-naught or sigma(0)) and slant-range perpendicular radar cross section (gamma-naught or gamma(0)) for both polarization channels of C-band Sentinel-1 data were compared and evaluated on monthly basis, during 2015, for discriminating peat depth classes using the decision tree classifier. Overall, gamma(0) features yielded a higher value of distance factors (DF) for peat depth classes, for both polarization channels, than those produced by the sigma(0), indicating a better performance in discriminating peat depth classes. Moreover, the seasonal variation of rainfall intensity was discovered to be influencing feature selection for peat depth classification. Thus, the combination of gamma(0) features derived in the much rain months was selected for separating the shallow-and medium-peat classes, whereas those derived in the less rain months was selected for discriminating the deep-and very deep-peat classes. In addition, the developed methodology gave the best accuracy for the very deep-peat class, with 76% and 67.86%, producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA), respectively, followed by the shallow-peat class that yielded a PA of 64% and UA of 80%. Subsequently, the deep-peat class produced a PA of 58% and UA of 59.18%, whereas the medium-peat class yielded the lowest PA and UA, of 54% and 49.09%, respectively. This study showed that the C-band dual-polarization SAR data have potential for classifying peat depth classes, particularly on oil palm plantations, and might serve as an efficient tool in peat depth classification used for sustainable management of tropical peatlands.

TI  - Mapping Water Levels across a Region of the Cuvette Centrale Peatland Complex
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inundation dynamics are the primary control on greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. Situated in the central Congo Basin, the Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex. However, our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in its water levels is limited. By addressing this gap, we can quantify the relationship between the Cuvette Centrale's water levels and greenhouse gas emissions, and further provide a baseline from which deviations caused by climate or land-use change can be observed, and their impacts understood. We present here a novel approach that combines satellite-derived rainfall, evapotranspiration and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate spatial and temporal changes in water level across a sub-region of the Cuvette Centrale. Our key outputs are a map showing the spatial distribution of rainfed and flood-prone locations and a daily, 100 m resolution map of peatland water levels. This map is validated using satellite altimetry data and in situ water table data from water loggers. We determine that 50% of peatlands within our study area are largely rainfed, and a further 22.5% are somewhat rainfed, receiving hydrological input mostly from rainfall (directly and via surface/sub-surface inputs in sloped areas). The remaining 27.5% of peatlands are mainly situated in riverine floodplain areas to the east of the Congo River and between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. The mean amplitude of the water level across our study area and over a 20-month period is 22.8 & PLUSMN; 10.1 cm to 1 standard deviation. Maximum temporal variations in water levels occur in the riverine floodplain areas and in the inter-fluvial region between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. Our results show that spatial and temporal changes in water levels can be successfully mapped over tropical peatlands using the pattern of net water input (rainfall minus evapotranspiration, not accounting for run-off) and L-band SAR data.

TI  - Progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems. Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted. During the 2019 El Nino, the involvement of a closed-loop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table, which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations.

AB  - Peatland is a fragile ecosystem in the tropical region which is prone to subsidence. Until now, there is still lack of procedure to rapidly assess a tropical peatland subsidence in a large area. Our objective was to compare subsidence in a used and restored zone in a peatland hydrological unit using synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-1A products (SAR data) in South Sumatra, Indonesia from the period of 2014-2021. The subsidence rate of used peatland estimated by the D-InSAR procedure were in the range of 28-80 cm year(-1) in the early period of its utilization and becoming less for the consecutive year (16-48 cm year(-1)). Meanwhile, the subsidence rate based on the field surveys was in the range of 4-50 cm year(-1) in the early period of peatland utilization. The subsidence rate in the used peatland zone (agriculture and plantations) was higher than that in the restoration zone for all SAR data pairs used in our study. The SAR data is a potential tool for the assessment, monitoring and differentiating subsidence rates among different peatland uses in a large area. This tool will help the Directorate of Peat Ecosystem Degradation Control, Directorate General of Environmental Pollution and Degradation Control, and Ministry of Environment and Forestry to plan for better peatland management and restoration.

TI  - Use of multifrequency (C-band and L-band) SAR data to monitor peat subsidence based on time-series SBAS InSAR technique
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in tropical regions like Indonesia are undergoing irreversible subsidence due to changes in land use (e.g., deforestation) and land management practices (e.g., drainage alteration), resulting in massive amounts of soil carbon loss. Several satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are operating concurrently at different frequencies, providing potentially useful data for monitoring surface motion over tropical peatlands. This study focused on the capability of C-band (SENTINEL-1) and L-band (PALSAR-2) SAR data to monitor the surface changes in the tropical peatlands area of Bengkalis Island, Indonesia, by applying time-series interferometric SAR (InSAR) with the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The average vertical velocity measured by SENTINEL-1 and PALSAR-2 for the period of 2018-2019 was -1.41 and -2.65 cm yr(-1), respectively. We also explored the potential of groundwater level (GWL) data converted to vertical displacement for validating SBAS InSAR. PALSAR-2 performed the best, exhibiting lower RMSE values for each land use compared to SENTINEL-1, with an overall RMSE of 1.383 and 1.988 cm yr(-1), respectively. Also, the subsidence rates of SENTINEL-1 were underestimated, showing a significantly lower mean subsidence difference (0.96 cm yr(-1)) than the reference. Our GWL-based subsidence data offered an alternative validation method for InSAR-based subsidence estimation. Therefore, the integration of time-series InSAR and GWL data can provide crucial information for monitoring the degradation of tropical peatlands.

TI  - Smoke radiocarbon measurements from Indonesian fires provide evidence for burning of millennia-aged peat
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to a strong El Nino, fires in Indonesia during September and October 2015 released a large amount of carbon dioxide and created a massive regional smoke cloud that severely degraded air quality in many urban centers across Southeast Asia. Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Nino-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (C-14) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m). The Delta C-14 of fire-emitted aerosol was -76 +/- 51 parts per thousand, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 +/- 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (similar to 85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Nino events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments.

TI  - Reflections on integrated research from community engagement in peatland restoration
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community engagement and integrated research are key approaches to solving complex socio-ecological challenges. This paper describes the experience of bringing together a team of natural and social scientists from Australia and Indonesia in the 'Gambut Kita' (translated as 'Our Peat') project. Gambut Kita aims to produce new knowledge and support efforts to successfully, and equitably, restore Indonesia's tropical peatlands and ensure that livelihoods can be maintained on restored (rewetted) landscapes. The paper focuses on experiences of using community engagement for integrated research. It discusses three community engagement approaches used in the project-resilience, adaptation pathways and transformation approach (RAPTA), participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and community-led analysis and planning (CLAP). It also describes the qualitative analysis of 14 interviews with the project team of lessons learned in community engagement for integrated research. 'Criteria for success' from the literature on international development projects is used to assess progress. The findings highlight the specific complexities of working across countries and cultures. Successful community engagement is not so much about the 'tool' but about the trust, agency, and support to change. The tools do, however, have different strengths. PRA and CLAP can build deep community understanding and relationships. RAPTA has strengths in framing visions and pathways to the future, systems thinking, anticipatory learning, and taking a cross-scale systems view which is required to solve many of the problems manifesting at local or community scales. Similarly, success in integrated research is not just about individuals, but structures (e.g. explicit process) and infrastructure (e.g. access to technology). These findings suggest that integrated research needs special considerations in terms of design, and these relate across scales to individual researchers as well as teams, leaders and organisations. Integrated research projects need careful, inclusive, iterative management with a lot of interaction to learn from each other, build a common vision, achieve clarity of roles, and share emerging findings.

TI  - Widespread subsidence and carbon emissions across Southeast Asian peatlands
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsidence and carbon emissions in tropical peatlands are primarily linked to drainage history, not land-use type, according to large-scale high-resolution remote sensing in Southeast Asia.Over the last three decades, most of the 25 million hectares of tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia have been deforested and drained. As a consequence, declining water tables are exposing peat to oxidation, converting plant material accumulated over millennia to carbon dioxide, and causing land subsidence. Here, we quantify the widespread peat carbon loss by using InSAR remote sensing to map subsidence at 90-m resolution across 2.7 Mha of peatland area from 2007 to 2011. Over 90% of the surveyed area is subsiding, with a mean rate of 2.2 cm yr(-1). Consequently, the region now faces loss of productive land and flooding because many peatlands are near sea level. Our measurements reveal that smallholder agricultural areas and degraded peatlands are subsiding at rates comparable to those of plantations, and that subsidence rates increase away from rivers and decrease over time following drainage. Because of its detailed spatial resolution, InSAR provides a valuable tool to identify emissions by land use and geography and to target hotspots for better management. Finally, we use remotely sensed maps to update IPCC emissions factors and calculate regional CO2 emissions from peat oxidation of 155 +/- 30 MtC yr(-1) in 2015, similar in magnitude to both regional fossil-fuel emissions and peat fires.

TI  - Industry-driven mitigation measures can reduce GHG emissions of palm oil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland stores a large amount of carbon. In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%-34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%-58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18-25 cm compared to 57-73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%-43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%-29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment.

TI  - Benefits of tropical peatland rewetting for subsidence reduction and forest regrowth: results from a large-scale restoration trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage and deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) in Southeast Asia cause carbon emissions and biodiversity loss of global concern. Restoration efforts to mitigate these impacts usually involve peatland rewetting by blocking canals. However, there have been no studies to date of the optimal rewetting approach that will reduce carbon emission whilst also promoting PSF regeneration. Here we present results of a large-scale restoration trial in Sumatra (Indonesia), monitored for 7.5 years. Water levels in a former plantation were raised over an area of 4800 ha by constructing 257 compacted peat dams in canals. We find peat surface subsidence rates in the rewetted restoration area and adjoining PSF to be halved where water tables were raised from similar to - 0.6 m to similar to - 0.3 m, demonstrating the success of rewetting in reducing carbon emission. A total of 57 native PSF tree species were found to spontaneously grow in the most rewetted conditions and in high densities, indicating that forest regrowth is underway. Based on our findings we propose that an effective PSF restoration strategy should follow stepwise rewetting to achieve substantial carbon emission reduction alongside unassisted regrowth of PSF, thereby enabling the peat, forest and canal vegetation to establish a new nature-based ecosystem balance.

TI  - Mitigating soil greenhouse-gas emissions from land-use change in tropical peatlands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Conversion of tropical peat swamp forests to meet the demand for industrial plantations and agricultural production systems has triggered rapid and substantial carbon loss in the Asia-Pacific region. Various management practices have been designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from tropical peat soils after changes in land use. We conducted a meta-analysis using 506 paired observations on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from peat soils under different land uses and the effects of management practices on emissions. As compared to peat swamp forest, other land uses had higher emissions of CO2 (heterotrophic respiration) and N2O from soils, whereas soil-based CH4 emissions were also increased but not significantly so. Raising the water table decreased CO2 emissions but increased N2O emissions; reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs led to decreased CO2 and N2O emissions in oil-palm (Elaeis spp) plantations and cropping systems; and shading and growing cover crops decreased CO2 emissions. Practices such as these are needed for careful management of tropical peatlands, and additional measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are required to guide future GHG mitigation strategies in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Temporal Subset SBAS InSAR Approach for Tropical Peatland Surface Deformation Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland in Southeast Asia has undergone rapid degradation and shows large subsidence due to oxidation and peat shrinkage. The measurement of those deformations is thus valuable for evaluating the peat condition and assessing peat restoration. The time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TInSAR), especially with the small baseline subsets (SBAS) method, is capable of measuring long-term deformation. However, the dynamic surface scatterers often change in tropical peatland, which degrades the coherent scatterer (CS) distribution density. This article presents a simple and efficient TInSAR approach that enhances the CS density under such dynamic surface scatter variation based on the SBAS method. In the presented approach, a long-time series of single-look complex images is separated into subsets, and deformation estimation is performed for each subset. The effectiveness of this simple solution was investigated by InSAR simulation and validated using SAR observation data. We applied the subset SBAS approach to the three-year Sentinel-1A C-band SAR dataset acquired over tropical peatland in Indonesia. The analyses showed an improved number of CSs for the introduced subset approach. We further introduce the color representation of CS temporal behavior per subset for visual interpretation of scatterer change.

TI  - Genome-resolved carbon processing potential of tropical peat microbiomes from an oil palm plantation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Tropical peatlands in South-East Asia are some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world. Extensive repurposing of such peatlands for forestry and agriculture has resulted in substantial microbially-driven carbon emissions. However, we lack an understanding of the microorganisms and their metabolic pathways involved in carbon turnover. Here, we address this gap by reconstructing 764 sub-species-level genomes from peat microbiomes sampled from an oil palm plantation located on a peatland in Indonesia. The 764 genomes cluster into 333 microbial species (245 bacterial and 88 archaeal), of which, 47 are near-complete (completeness >= 90%, redundancy <= 5%, number of unique tRNAs >= 18) and 170 are substantially complete (completeness >= 70%, redundancy <= 10%). The capacity to respire amino acids, fatty acids, and polysaccharides was widespread in both bacterial and archaeal genomes. In contrast, the ability to sequester carbon was detected only in a few bacterial genomes. We expect our collection of reference genomes to help fill some of the existing knowledge gaps about microbial diversity and carbon metabolism in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Opportunities and risk management of peat restoration in Indonesia: lessons learned from peat restoration actors
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant efforts have been invested to restore degraded peatlands in Indonesia considering the high mitigation potential as an effective natural climate solution. However, peat restoration in Indonesia faces challenges such as suboptimal planning and risk management. In this study, we assessed the national potential peat restoration area using spatial analysis and identified the associated risks based on lessons learned from past restoration efforts. We estimated the extent of potential restoration areas by analyzing canal networks, burnt areas, and critical land maps at the national scale. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, followed by a national workshop with relevant stakeholders to assess the potential risks and develop risk management strategies for peat restoration. Our analysis estimated 6 Mha, or 45% of Indonesia's total peatland area, as potentially restorable areas for rewetting and/or revegetation efforts. Of this potential area, 50% falls under concession holder management. The identified risks consisted of technical (39%), management (38%), social (17%), and economic (6%) factors, with 15 and 22% classified as extreme and high risk, respectively. Policymakers can use these findings to strengthen regulations and improve the chances of successful restoration implementation, supporting Indonesia's emissions reduction target and providing economic benefits for restoration actors.

TI  - Targeted land management strategies could halve peatland fire occurrences in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesian peatlands and their large carbon stores are under threat from recurrent large-scale fires driven by anthropogenic ecosystem degradation. Although the key drivers of peatland fires are known, a holistic methodology for assessing the potential of fire mitigation strategies is lacking. Here, we use machine learning (convolutional neural network) to develop a model capable of recreating historic fire observations based on pre-fire season parameters. Using this model, we test multiple land management and peatland restoration scenarios and quantify the associated potential for fire reduction. We estimate that converting heavily degraded swamp shrubland areas to swamp forest or plantations can reduce fires occurrence by approximately 40% or 55%, respectively. Blocking all but major canals to restore these degraded areas to swamp forest may reduce fire occurrence by 70%. Our findings suggest that effective land management strategies can influence fire regimes and substantially reduce carbon emissions associated with peatland fires, in addition to enabling sustainable management of these important ecosystems.Land management scenarios that restore degraded swamp shrubland areas to swamp forest through blocking minor canal systems could substantially reduce peatland fire occurrence and associated greenhouse gas emissions, according to a machine learning and numerical modelling study.

TI  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantation on tropical peatland in South East Asia: Photosynthetic response to soil drainage level for mitigation of soil carbon emissions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While existing moratoria in Indonesia and Malaysia should preclude continued large-scale expansion of palm oil pro-duction into new areas of South-East Asian tropical peatland, existing plantations in the region remain a globally sig-nificant source of atmospheric carbon due to drainage driven decomposition of peatland soils. Previous studies have made clear the direct link between drainage depth and peat carbon decomposition and significant reductions in the emission rate of CO2 can be made by raising water tables nearer to the soil surface. However, the impact of such changes on palm fruit yield is not well understood and will be a critical consideration for plantation managers. Here we take advantage of very high frequency, long-term monitoring of canopy-scale carbon exchange at a mature oil palm plantation in Malaysian Borneo to investigate the relationship between drainage level and photosynthetic uptake and consider the confounding effects of light quality and atmospheric vapour pressure deficit. Canopy modelling from our dataset demonstrated that palms were exerting significantly greater stomatal control at deeper water table depths (WTD) and the optimum WTD for photosynthesis was found to be between 0.3 and 0.4 m below the soil surface. Rais-ing WTD to this level, from the industry typical drainage level of 0.6 m, could increase photosynthetic uptake by 3.6 % and reduce soil surface emission of CO2 by 11 %. Our study site further showed that despite being poorly drained com-pared to other planting blocks at the same plantation, monthly fruit bunch yield was, on average, 14 % greater. While these results are encouraging, and at least suggest that raising WTD closer to the soil surface to reduce emissions is un-likely to produce significant yield penalties, our results are limited to a single study site and more work is urgently needed to confirm these results at other plantations.

TI  - Evaluating bundles of interventions to prevent peat-fires in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance.

TI  - Catastrophic impact of extreme 2019 Indonesian peatland fires on urban air quality and health
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland fires generate substantial quantities of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and in Indonesia are intensified during El Ni & ntilde;o-related drought leading to severe air quality impacts affecting local and distant populations. Limited in-situ data often necessitates reliance on air quality models, like that of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, whose accuracy in extreme conditions is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate how a network of low-cost sensors around Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan during the 2019 fire season, quantified extreme air quality and city-scale variability. The data indicates relatively strong model performance. Health impacts are substantial with estimates of over 1200 excess deaths in the Palangka Raya region, over 3200 across Central Kalimantan and more than 87,000 nationwide in 2019 due to fire-induced PM2.5 exposure. These findings highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate extreme fire events, including reducing fire use and landscape remediation to prevent peat fire ignition.Networks of low-cost sensors can be used with atmospheric models to understand variability of air quality on a fine scale and show that emissions from peatland fires contribute to many excess deaths, suggests an analysis from the 2019 fire season in Kalimantan

TI  - Forest disturbance alerts for the Congo Basin using Sentinel-1
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A humid tropical forest disturbance alert using Sentinel-1 radar data is presented for the Congo Basin. Radar satellite signals can penetrate through clouds, allowing Sentinel-1 to provide gap-free observations for the tropics consistently every 6-12 days at 10 m spatial scale. In the densely cloud covered Congo Basin, this represents a major advantage for the rapid detection of small-scale forest disturbances such as subsistence agriculture and selective logging. Alerts were detected with latest available Sentinel-1 images and results are presented from January 2019 to July 2020. We mapped 4 million disturbance events during this period, totalling 1.4 million ha with nearly 80% of events smaller than 0.5 ha. Monthly distribution of alert totals varied widely across the Congo Basin countries and can be linked to regional differences in wet and dry season cycles, with more forest disturbances in the dry season. Results indicated high user's and producer's accuracies and the rapid confirmation of alerts within a few weeks. Our disturbance alerts provide confident detection of events larger than or equal to 0.2 ha but do not include smaller events, which suggests that disturbance rates in the Congo Basin are even higher than presented in this study. The new alert product can help to better study the forest dynamics in the Congo Basin with improved spatial and temporal detail and near real-time detections, and highlights the value of dense Sentinel-1 time series data for large-area tropical forest monitoring. The research contributes to the Global Forest Watch initiative in providing timely and accurate information to support a wide range of stakeholders in sustainable forest management and law enforcement. The alerts are available via the https://www.globalforestwatch.org and http://radd-alert.wur.nl.

AB  - Kalimantan peatland spans similar to 5.9million ha (similar to 11% of Kalimantan's total terrestrial land area) as a part of Indonesian peatlands, covers similar to 21 million ha, contains similar to 57.8 Gtof terrestrial carbon. Land cover change of peatland forest results in significant sources CO2 emissions. Thus, we identified to estimate carbon emissions generated by crop land and ex burnt activities in Kalimantan's peatlands degraded forest. Soil CO2 respiration was measured under four of the most prominent land cover and annual agricultural crops on 4-5 year post fire (fern, corn, pineapple) and newly burnt areas in West Kalimantan peatlands. Measurements were obtained from Licor 8100 and gathered by monthly assessments. Among the land cover types showed different mean monthly CO2 fluxes. Soil CO2 respiration on newly burnt peatland, pineapple plantation and fern covered showed the highest and not significantly different among them. Cornsmall-scale plantation soil respired the lowest and significantly different from the other three land covers. Dry vs. rainy month comparisons show huge different (>50%) monthly CO2 fluxes rate. Each land cover type has distinctive peat environmental factors that significantly affect CO2 respiration. The result indicates that each crop/cover types generate different level site factors, which affect different level of peat CO2 rates. The regression models of site factors measured for each specific land cover can be applied to obtain better estimate CO2 respiration rates of degraded peatland and agricultural crop cover types. Moreover, it is able to be applied as a baseline for degraded peatland management and CO2 emission mitigation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Peatland subsidence and vegetation cover degradation as impacts of the 2015 El nino event revealed by Sentinel-1A SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the world's largest tropical peatland, mostly located in the southern province of Sumatra, the south of Kalimantan, and Papua. The catastrophic fires between June and October 2015 induced by the El Niiio event burnt most of these peatland areas. We analyzed spatio-temporal peat subsidence during pre- and post-fires in the peat hydrological unit of Sungai Sugihan Sungai Saleh (KHGSS), South Sumatra using Sentinel-1 images by applying DInSAR-SBAS algorithm. Based on our analysis, the linear subsidence rate after the 2015 peat fires increased by a factor 6.4 compared to that of pre-fires. Generally, the estimated subsidence is temporally well-correlated with the precipitation variation. In addition, the subsidence patterns are spatially correlated with the hotspot distribution, peat thickness, and drainage networks. Furthermore, we mapped vegetation cover over the KHGSS by using the Sentinel-1 images as well. The results show that the vegetation degradation is correlated with the hotspot distribution and the highly-degraded vegetation associated with the 2015 peat fires. It demonstrated that the 2015 El Nino event has significant impacts on increasing the amount of the subsidence and the vegetation degradation in KHGSS area.

TI  - Litter Decomposition in Wet Rubber and Fruit Agroforests: Below the Threshold for Tropical Peat Formation
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are shaped by slow litter decomposition, but threshold decomposition rates that allow peat formation remain unclear. Can agroforestry in the tropics be compatible with paludiculture that allows peat formation? We explored the determinants of litter decomposition in wet agroforests adjacent to tropical peatlands in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) by litterbag studies (up to 16 weeks) with standing litter sources to estimate rate constants, characterize litter quality (especially lignin (L), polyphenolics (Pp) and nitrogen (N)), and monitor temperature and groundwater levels. In litter transfer experiments we tested for home-field advantage (HFA) effects between land cover types. Mean residence times around 85 weeks at 27 degrees C were associated with a high (L + Pp)/N ratio. However, in the crossover treatments, mean residence times varied from 30 to 180 weeks and strong HFA effects (up to 80% faster decomposition at "home") were found when litter from other sources was tested in old fruit-based agroforests. HFA indicates a local decomposer community well-adapted to its normal litter diet. Litter residence times of around two years are below the apparent peat formation threshold. Maintaining wet agroforest conditions adjacent to peat domes supports peatland rewetting and restoration but does not contribute to on-site peat formation processes.

TI  - Influence of FSC certification on the governance of the logging sector in the Congo basin
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of private forest governance systems, such as the standard and approach developed by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), is often assessed at the local level although they also have an indirect influence on public policies at the national level. Such spillover effects must be understood to assess the effectiveness of certification in contributing to improved forest governance. With this purpose, this article analyses the influences of the implementation of FSC standards on changes in forest governance in Cameroon, Congo and Gabon based on perceptions of 43 "knowledgeable" actors of FSC natural forest management. The information was collected through the use of semi-open and open interviews, and rankings. Findings show that perceived FSC influence on forest governance has followed two pathways: (a) a clear impact on stakeholder participation and timber traceability; and (b) a limited impact on improving national governance, as illustrated by the lack of global improvement in resource management practices or in biodiversity conservation. Moreover, interviewees agreed that struggles against corruption and transparency have not been impacted by the FSC certification in the Congo Basin. This mitigated influence of FSC on forest governance is first explained by a limited spillover effect of the virtuous practices of the seven FSC-certified companies on the national logging sector. Secondly, progress in FSC certification has been little taken up by public policies, which remain the main leverage for action on forest governance in producing countries.

TI  - Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems framework into restoration planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of tropical peat swamp forest to drainage-based agriculture alters greenhouse gas (GHG) production, but the magnitude of these changes remains highly uncertain. Current emissions factors for oil palm grown on drained peat do not account for temporal variation over the plantation cycle and only consider CO2 emissions. Here, we present direct measurements of GHGs emitted during the conversion from peat swamp forest to oil palm plantation, accounting for CH4 and N2O as well as CO2. Our results demonstrate that emissions factors for converted peat swamp forest is in the range 70-117 t CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% confidence interval, CI), with CO2 and N2O responsible for ca. 60 and ca. 40% of this value, respectively. These GHG emissions suggest that conversion of Southeast Asian peat swamp forest is contributing between 16.6 and 27.9% (95% CI) of combined total national GHG emissions from Malaysia and Indonesia or 0.44 and 0.74% (95% CI) of annual global emissions.

TI  - Refining greenhouse gas emission factors for Indonesian peatlands and mangroves to meet ambitious climate targets
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - For countries' emission - reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement to be effective, baseline emission/removals levels and reporting must be as transparent and accurate as possible. For Indonesia, which holds among the largest area of tropical peatlands and mangrove forest in the world, it is particularly important for these high - carbon ecosystems to produce high - accuracy greenhouse gas inventory and to improve national forest reference emissions level/forest reference level. Here, we highlight the opportunity for refining greenhouse gas emission factors (EF) of peatlands and mangroves and describe scientific challenges to support climate policy processes in Indonesia, where 55 to 59% of national emission reduction targets by 2030 depend on mitigation in Forestry and Other Land Use. Based on the stock - difference and flux change approaches, we examine higher - tier EF for drained and rewetted peatland, peatland fires, mangrove conversions, and mangrove on peatland to improve future greenhouse gas flux reporting in Indonesia. We suggest that these refinements will be essential to support Indonesia in achieving Forest and Other Land Use net sink by 2030 and net zero emissions targets by 2060 or earlier.

TI  - Land use changes, green house gas emissions, and rehabilitation model of native tree species towards sustainable management
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tropical peatlands play a crucial role in the global ecosystem. These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carb & oacute;n dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity.

TI  - Rapid assessment of the value of forest income for people in Central Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable data on the contribution of forests to the livelihoods of households in the Congo Basin are not always readily available to governments and decision-makers. This paper assesses the value of forest resources on livelihoods in Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Central Africa Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Data were collected using the Forest Poverty Linkages Toolkit, between 2012 and 2014 on stratified samples of 616 Bantu and indigenous people's households in 15 villages. The study reveals that forest resources account for 48% to 63% of the total revenue of rural households. In Bantu households, estimates of the gross income from the forest per capita/day range from $US 0.18 to $US 1.3. This value is about double that received by indigenous people except in Congo. Non-cash income is about twice as high as cash income. On average, cash income reaches only about 23% of the World Bank $1.25 a day income level for chronic poverty. However, non-cash income - about twice as high as cash income - mitigates these profound poverty levels to some extent. The paper concludes by considering the importance of the findings for policy-making in Central Africa and the Congo Basin, and more widely. It is suggested that much more data of this kind is need to shape appropriate approaches to sustainable forest management, with a better understanding of the economic security and the livelihood resilience of the chronic poor increasingly kept in mind.

TI  - Ecological outcomes and popular perceptions of urban restored forests in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is suggested as a tool to mitigate environmental problems caused by urbanization, but its utility may be hampered by conflict between ecological design and neighbouring communities' needs. We explore this issue by comparing vegetation diversity and structure in a 21-year-old urban reforestation project in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, with a nearby reference forest, and we assessed popular perceptions about the project. Overall, density and basal area of canopy trees in the restoration plantation reached 73% and 46%, respectively, of the values found in the reference forest, but ground cover by exotic grasses was substantially higher in the planted forest. Rarefied species richness was similarly high in the plantation forest (59 species) and in the remnant forest (69 species), but species composition was markedly different. The human legacy on restoration diminished with time, reflected in the higher proportion of species and individuals of late-successional, native and not-planted species in the seedling community of the plantation forest. While community perceptions of reforestation were positive and both use and non-use values were reported, interviewees reported little involvement in the development of the project, which could have contributed to synergies between ecological and social outcomes.

TI  - Fire-sensitive and threatened plants in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, Brazil: Identifying priority areas for Integrated Fire Management and ecological restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme wildfires present an ever-increasing problem in different landscapes around the world. Here, we explore recent wildfires to prioritize recovery efforts and mitigate effects of future wildfires in the Pantanal, the largest continuous wetland in the world. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM), we categorize affected areas based on potential levels of degradation by fire and the predicted suitability for threatened and fire-sensitive plants. Based on this information, we identify key areas for fire prevention. Under land cover change scenarios predicted for 2050, approximately 25 % of the land cover under future threat will have potentially high biomass accumulation. We identified 1272 km(2) in priority areas with forest formation, with restoration cost of at least US$ 576,189. This case study provides an analysis workflow that can be used to assess other wildfire-threatened parts of the world. These results can inform public policy to establish new fire brigades, conservation efforts using Integrated Fire Management, and restoration areas to mitigate biodiversity loss.

TI  - How Legal-Oriented Restoration Programs Enhance Landscape Connectivity? Insights From the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide, but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity. Here, we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the Brazilian Forest Code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Brazil. We gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2,408 rural properties, totalizing 748,601 ha of farmlands within the Atlantic Forest biome and its ecotone with Cerrado, two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Together, rural properties account for 50,783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs). On the basis of this, we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within APPs, as determined by the Forest Code. The simulation of restoration at the property-level resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches, reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size. At the sugarcane mill level, the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity. Despite these benefits, final forest cover (remnant plus restored forests) would still be reduced (< 20%-the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law) in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation. The mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in human-modified tropical landscapes, but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests.

TI  - Importance of bistatic SAR features from TanDEM-X for forest mapping and monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are one of the important sources for human induced carbon dioxide emissions and their rates are highest in tropical forests. For man-kind, it is of great importance to track land-use conversions like deforestation, e.g. for sustainable forest management and land use planning, for carbon balancing and to support the implementation of international initiatives like REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors are suitable to reliably and frequently monitor tropical forests due to their weather independence. The TanDEM-X mission (which is mainly aimed to create a unique global high resolution digital elevation model) currently operates two X-band SAR satellites, acquiring interferometric SAR data for the Earth's entire land surface multiple times. The operational mission provides interferometric data as well as mono- and bistatic scattering coefficients. These datasets are homogenous, globally consistent and are acquired in high spatial resolution. Hence, they may offer a unique basic dataset which could be useful in land cover monitoring.Based on first datasets available from the TanDEM-X mission, the main goal of this research is to investigate the information content of TanDEM-X data for mapping forests and other land cover classes in a tropical peatland area. More specifically, the study explores the utility of bistatic features for distinguishing between open and closed forest canopies, which is of relevance in the context of deforestation and forest degradation monitoring. To assess the predominant information content of TanDEM-X data, the importance of information derived from the bistatic system is compared against the monostatic case, usually available from SAR systems. The usefulness of the TanDEM-X mission data, i.e. scattering coefficients, derived textural information and interferometric coherence is investigated via a feature selection process. The resulting optimal feature sets representing a monostatic and a bistatic SAR dataset were used in a subsequent classification to assess the added value of the bistatic TanDEM-X features in the separability of land cover classes. The results obtained indicated that especially the interferometric coherence significantly improved the separability of thematic classes compared to a dataset of monostatic acquisition. The bistatic coherence was mainly governed by volume decorrelation of forest canopy constituents and carries information about the canopy structure which is related to canopy cover. In contrast the bistatic scattering coefficient had no significant contribution to class separability. The classification with coherence and textural information outperformed the classification with the monostatic scattering coefficient and texture by more than 10% and achieved an overall accuracy of 85%. These results indicate that TanDEM-X can serve as a valuable and consistent source for mapping and monitoring tropical forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI  - Multicriteria approach to prioritize forest restoration areas for biodiversity conservation in the eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the global magnitude of forest degradation and deforestation and the high cost of ecological restoration, several approaches have been used to prioritize conservation or restoration areas based on different objectives and criteria. The present work aims to develop a multicriteria approach to defining forest restoration priority areas in the Itacaitinas River basin, eastern Amazon, that maximizes the criteria equitably. The selected criteria were: improve forest connectivity, provide climatic refuges for biodiversity, mitigate the impacts of deforestation on streamflow, and improve the probability of natural regeneration. A strong difference between selected areas was observed when the criteria of forest connectivity and mitigate the impact on streamflow were considered separately, but greater equity among the criteria was achieved using the multicriteria approach. The most priority areas were concentrated near protected areas. The method used provides a flexible framework, and different criteria or subarea selections can be applied for different purposes to facilitate adaptive management. Analyzing forest restoration prioritization on rural properties can provide guidance for conserving and restoring biodiversity at the landscape scale while complying with legal requirements.

TI  - Towards an Inclusive Approach to Forest Management: Highlight of the Perception and Participation of Local Communities in the Management of miombo Woodlands around Lubumbashi (Haut-Katanga, DR Congo)
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The misappropriation of sustainable forest programs by local communities and the under-utilization of their knowledge are major impediments to the mitigation of deforestation. Within this context, participation has become a principle used in almost all interventions. It is important to evaluate the practices in this area to ensure better involvement of local communities. This survey examined the perception and participation of local communities in the management of miombo woodlands, based on semi-structured questionnaire surveys involving 945 households in 5 villages in the Lubumbashi rural area. The results reveal that local communities perceive soil fertility loss and deforestation as major environmental challenges in their area. This perception remains largely influenced by their socio-demographic factors such as respondents' age, seniority in the villages, and level of education. To mitigate deforestation, the rare actions of provincial public services and non-governmental organizations are focused on the sustainable exploitation of miombo woodlands through the development of simple management plans, reforestation, and forest control. These activities are sparse and poorly inclusive of scientific findings and the priorities of local communities. These justify poor community participation, particularly in the actions of provincial public services. For a better appropriation of sustainable forest management plans and to reinforce miombo woodlands' resilience to anthropogenic pressures, based on these findings, we recommend a concerted and inclusive approach to forest planning.

TI  - Forest cover effects of payments for ecosystem services: Evidence from an impact evaluation in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the effects of "Water and Forest Producers" (PAF), a payment for ecosystem services project, on forest cover outcomes in a watershed serving the Rio de Janeiro region of Brazil. We apply propensity score matching and regression to 81 beneficiary properties on 8848 ha and 398 control properties on 33,748 ha. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for changes in rates of reforestation and deforestation, and the resulting change in forest cover. Over the first 7 years of PAF (2010-2016), our results indicate that the project increased forest cover on participating properties by only 136 ha (95% confidence intervals of 8-265 hectares), or 1.5% relative to our estimate of the counterfactual scenario without PAF. Impacts on forest cover were caused mostly by reduced deforestation rather than reforestation. "Placebo" impact tests estimated using pre-intervention data indicate that our results are robust. The observed forest cover benefit came at the perhectare cost of $32,963 ($16,917-$560,367) paid mostly with off-site mitigation funds. Semi-structured interviews with PAF beneficiaries suggest that the limited impacts of PAF may be the result of mostly enrolling properties that likely would have remained forested even without the project.

TI  - Learning from change in the Sangha Tri-National landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A participatory landscape monitoring initiative was introduced in the Sangha Tri-National landscape at the frontier of Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic in 2006. The initiative allowed a broad range of stakeholders, called the Sangha Group, to monitor changes in local peoples' livelihoods and the environment. The group held annual meetings to discuss changes in the landscape. The intention was that the work of the Group would enable adaptation of management interventions. Simple simulation modelling techniques and a set of indicators were used to track changes in the landscape. Indicators were identified by local people who were then invited to assess them annually. The large number and diversity of stakeholders occupying a vast area of forest and a shortage of skilled enumerators meant that indicator values were difficult to measure consistently. However the existence of the models and indicator framework did enrich the discussions amongst the stakeholders and helped them to understand the main drivers of change in the landscape. Interventions of aid agencies and conservation organisations had little impact on local peoples' livelihoods but external influences, notably the global financial crisis in 2008 and the civil strife in the CAR sector beginning in 2011 caused a serious deterioration in livelihoods and the environment in the landscape.

TI  - Identifying Key Drivers of Peatland Fires Across Kalimantan's Ex-Mega Rice Project Using Machine Learning
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout Indonesia ecological degradation, agricultural expansion, and the digging of drainage canals has compromised the integrity and functioning of peatland forests. Fragmented landscapes of scrubland, cultivation, degraded forest, and newly established plantations are then susceptible to extensive fires that recur each year. However, a comprehensive understanding of all the drivers of fire distribution and the conditions of initiation is still absent. Here we show the first analysis in the region that encompasses a wide range of driving factors within a single model that captures the inter-annual variation, as well as the spatial distribution of peatland fires. We developed a fire susceptibility model using machine learning (XGBoost random forest) that characterizes the relationships between key predictor variables and the distribution of historic fire locations. We then determined the relative importance of each predictor variable in controlling the initiation and spread of fires. The model included land-cover classifications, a forest clearance index, vegetation indices, drought indices, distances to infrastructure, topography, and peat depth, as well as the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI). The model performance consistently scores highly in both accuracy and precision across all years (>75% and >67.5% respectively), though recall metrics are much lower (>25%). Our results confirm the anthropogenic dependence of extreme fires in the region, with distance to settlements and distance to canals consistently weighted the most important driving factors within the model structure. Our results may help target the root causes of fire initiation and propagation to better construct regulation and rehabilitation efforts to mitigate future fires.

TI  - Recovery of soil phosphorus on former bauxite mines through tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils, especially when topsoil is removed by mining. This nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions, which have direct consequences for P availability to plants and, consequently, for restoration success. Therefore, understanding how the stocks of different soil P fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions, monitoring, and adaptive management. Here, we investigated the recovery of soil P fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic P at (1) a bauxite mine prepared for restoration; (2) two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years; and (3) an old-growth forest remnant. Overall, restored areas recovered levels of labile organic P (P-o-NaHCO3) at 5-40 cm and of moderately labile organic P (P-o-NaOH) at different depths, exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest. The use of P-rich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome. Some other fractions, however, recovered only after 24 years of restoration. Other inorganic P fractions did not differ among mined, restored, and conserved sites: nonlabile P-i(residual P and P-HCl), labile P-i(P-i-NaHCO3), and moderately labile P-i(P-i-NaOH). Forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil P fractions, highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining.

TI  - Linking centennial scale anthropogenic changes and sedimentary records as lessons for urban coastal management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal eutrophication and urban flooding are increasingly important components of global change. Although increased seawater renewal by barrier openings and channelizing are common mitigation measures in coastal lagoons worldwide, their effects on these ecosystems are not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the re-lationships between human interventions in the watershed, artificial connections to the sea, and the sediment burial rates in an urban coastal lagoon (Maric & PRIME;a lagoon, Southeastern Brazil). Sediment accretion along with nutrient and carbon burial rates were determined in two sediment cores representing the past-120 years (210Pb dating) and associated with anthropogenic changes as indicated by historical records and geoinformation ana-lyses. Lagoon infilling and eutrophication, expressed by the average sediment accretion, TP, TN, and OC burial rates, respectively, increased-9-18, 13-15, 11-14 and 11-12-fold from the earliest (<1950) to the most recent (2000-2017) period. These multi-proxy records confirm mechanistic links between deforestation, urbanization, and untreated sewage discharges. In addition, our findings reveal artificial connections to the sea may contribute to lagoonal eutrophication and infilling, particularly when not integrated with sewage treatment and forest conservation or reforestation in the watershed. Therefore, increased seawater renewal by physical interventions commonly considered as mitigation measures may in contrast cause severe degradation in coastal lagoons, causing harmful consequences that should be not neglected when implementing management practices.

TI  - Geographic Setting and Groundwater Table Control Carbon Emission from Indonesian Peatland: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia's emission reduction target by 2030.

TI  - Rapid Response of Bird Communities to Small-Scale Reforestation in Indonesian Borneo
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha) community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by 29% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site) were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity.

TI  - The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowgmund), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha(-1)), AR (66.414 Mg C h(-1)) AsR (65.73 Mg C ha(-1)) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha(-1)). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.

TI  - Measuring the causal effect of no-till system adoption on Brazilian natural areas
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till system (NTS) is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity. Therefore, employing NTS results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas. This study aims to evaluate the causal effect between NTS adoption and land use decisions in Brazil, with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas. The discussion on the effects of NTS use over agricultural practices gains relevance in Brazil, given the country's strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity. We conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching, which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly. Our statistical results show that the adoption of NTS had a positive effect on the natural (0.338; p-value < 0.05) and cultivated agricultural (0.214; p-value < 0.05) areas of the treated municipalities. The evidence from this case study indicates that NTS allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands, preserving natural areas, while corroborating Borlaug's approach and further reinforcing the use of NTS as a sustainable soil management practice.

TI  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration by applied nucleation: A case study in the Pampa, southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the Pampa biome is still inadequate, with a gap in the knowledge of the successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration. Thus, monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration, as well as to ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for adaptive management actions. In this study, the progression of the techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was investigated using ecological indicators. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, in an area of riparian forest. The region belongs to the Pampa biome, southern Brazil. The evaluations took place in two different monitoring periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2021, in two areas, one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other under passive restoration. Ecological indicators of composition, structure, and function were measured, sampled in 10 plots through monitoring per area. The results showed significant differences between the monitoring periods in each area by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). The areas presented differences in floristic composition between monitoring periods by non-metric scaling analysis (nMDS), and differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER). The dendrometric variables (height, diameter, breast height, nuclei area, and crown area) presented a significant difference by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) in the evaluation of the development of the nuclei. The ecological indicators of structure (canopy cover, soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area under restoration by applied nucleation. In the area under passive restoration, the indicators of structure (litter thickness and soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period. In both areas, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. was the species that most contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring moments. In the development of the nuclei, the dendrometric variables were statistically superior in the second monitoring period, pointing to progression in the development of the nuclei. It is concluded that the restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied area, as the nuclei progress over time. The area under passive restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession. The study result provide support for the improvement in future restoration projects for riparian areas in the Pampa biome.

TI  - Fires, Smoke Exposure, and Public Health: An Integrative Framework to Maximize Health Benefits From Peatland Restoration
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions of particulate matter from fires associated with land management practices in Indonesia contribute to regional air pollution and mortality. We assess the public health benefits in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore from policies to reduce fires by integrating information on fire emissions, atmospheric transport patterns, and population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We use adjoint sensitivities to relate fire emissions to PM2.5 for a range of meteorological conditions and find that a Business-As-Usual scenario of land use change leads, on average, to 36,000 excess deaths per year into the foreseeable future (the next several decades) across the region. These deaths are largely preventable with fire reduction strategies, such as blocking fires in peatlands, industrial concessions, or protected areas, which reduce the health burden by 66, 45, and 14%, respectively. The effectiveness of these different strategies in mitigating human health impacts depends on the location of fires relative to the population distribution. For example, protecting peatlands through eliminating all fires on such lands would prevent on average 24,000 excess deaths per year into the foreseeable future across the region because, in addition to storing large amounts of fuel, many peatlands are located directly upwind of densely populated areas. We also demonstrate how this framework can be used to prioritize restoration locations for the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency based on their ability to reduce pollution exposure and health burden. This scientific framework is publicly available through an online decision support tool that allows stakeholders to readily determine the public health benefits of different land management strategies.Plain Language Summary Regularly occurring fires in Indonesia are associated with drought conditions and agricultural practices. These fires contribute to dangerous levels of particulate matter pollution that are harmful to public health throughout the region. We develop an interdisciplinary scientific framework to connect land use decisions with fire activity and public health outcomes. Our estimates find that if current trends continue, exposure to air pollution from Indonesian fires would cause, on average, 36,000 excess deaths per year across Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. These deaths can be prevented through land management strategies, which would reduce the number of deaths attributable to air pollution from fires. Current plans to restore peatlands would reduce regional fire emissions-related mortality by approximately 66% if fully implemented.

TI  - Mapping Land Suitability to Guide Landscape Restoration in the Amazon
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond reducing deforestation, the control of forest degradation, the promotion of forest restoration, and the improvement of agricultural practices in the Brazilian Amazon are becoming increasingly important for sustainable development. To enable farmers and authorities to organize their landscapes and optimize both agricultural practices and the provision of ecosystem services, mapping land suitability is essential, but it is lacking in the region. In this paper, we present a method for mapping land suitability at a fine scale (30-m pixels), adapted to the needs of farmers and municipalities, to not only optimize agricultural production but also the ecosystem services provided by forests. We used topographic data from the Brazilian municipality of Paragominas to produce four maps, one each of soil texture, slope, floodplains, and hydrography, that we then combined into a single land suitability map. This map has been incorporated into a spatial database, which also contains information on land use, remoteness, and land tenure. We performed spatial analyses to measure the process of land use change, and to define indicators that enable local stakeholders to organize landscape restoration. We highlight an organic link between agricultural intensification and forest restoration, and provide a spatial tool for landscape design, assessment, and monitoring.

TI  - Prescribed Burning Reduces Large, High-Intensity Wildfires and Emissions in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has recently (2014) changed from a zero-fire policy to an Integrated Fire Management (IFM) program with the active use of prescribed burning (PB) in federal Protected Areas (PA) and Indigenous Territories (IT) of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). PB is commonly applied in the management of fire-prone ecosystems to mitigate large, high-intensity wildfires, the associated emissions, and high fire suppression costs. However, the effectiveness of such fire management in reducing large wildfires and emissions over Brazil remains mostly unevaluated. Here, we aim to fill the gap in the scientific evidence of the PB benefits by relying on the most up-to-date, satellite-derived fire datasets of burned area (BA), fire size, duration, emissions, and intensity from 2003 to 2018. We focused on two Cerrado ITs with different sizes and hydrological regimes, Xerente and Araguaia, where IFM has been in place since 2015. To understand fire regime dynamics, we divided the study period into three phases according to the prevalent fire policy and the individual fire scars into four size classes. We considered two fire seasons: management fire season (MFS, which goes from rainy to mid-dry season, when PBs are undertaken) and wildfires season (WFS, when PBs are not performed and fires tend to grow out of control). Our results show that the implementation of the IFM program was responsible for a decrease of the areas affected by high fire recurrence in Xerente and Araguaia, when compared with the Zero Fire Phase (2008-2013). In both regions, PB effectively reduced the large wildfires occurrence, the number of medium and large scars, fire intensity, and emissions, changing the prevalent fire season from the WFS to the MFS. Such reductions are significant since WFS causes higher negative impacts on biodiversity conservation and higher greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that the effect on wildfires can still be reduced if effective fire management policies, including PB, continue to be implemented during the coming decades.

TI  - Multi-scenario modelling framework for afforestation strategies to mitigate runoff and flooding across storm return periods in tropical large river basins: the Upper Citarum case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Flooding is a frequent disaster in Indonesia, especially in the Upper Citarum River Basin, causing substantial damage. This study assesses the impact of afforestation on runoff, peak discharge and flood risks under different storm conditions using hydrological (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models. Six afforestation scenarios were analyzed: No Forest (NF), Medium Afforestation (MF), Bandung's 2029 spatial plan (F-2029), Riverbank Afforestation (RF), spatial plan for 2029 (SP-2029) and No Built-up (NB), with Land Cover 2021 (LC-2021) as the baseline. Rainfall return periods (2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 years) were generated from 32 years of rainfall data. The results show land cover changes significantly influence runoff, with urbanization increasing flood risks and afforestation improving water retention. Riverbank afforestation (RF) and reduced built-up areas (NB) were the most effective in mitigating flood risks, while reduced forest cover (NF) and urban expansion (SP-2029) exacerbated flooding. Validation with historical flood data highlighted flood-prone areas like Margahayu, Bojongsoang, Dayeuhkolot and Baleendah. Frequent but less severe floods were noted in 2- and 5-year return period scenarios. These findings emphasize the critical role of afforestation and land cover management in reducing flood risks and enhancing resilience in the Upper Citarum Basin.

TI  - Ecological restoration efforts in tropical rural landscapes: Challenges and policy implications in a highly degraded region
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has received increasing attention as international agreements have set ambitious goals tc mitigate environmental change and reshape degraded landscapes. However, current restoration activities sometimes remain modest in their success. In particular, tropical forest restoration has had mixed outcomes wilt variable cost-efficiency. Here, we address the need for taking into account the spatial context of restoration tc inform policy initiatives that aim to improve the ecological and economic effectiveness of restoration. We ac" cessed the spatial distribution of relevant characteristics for ecological restoration in an emblematic heavily degraded tropical region: Sao Paulo state, Brazil. We compared statewide patterns in soil erosion risk, distance tc remnant habitat, and agricultural land use, to their characteristics in land voluntarily offered for active re storation. Based on this comparison, active restoration is likely to take place through small, low-priced parcels of land, usually in the context of substantial soil erosion risk and exacerbated deforestation. Restoration ecology predicts the need for expensive actions to assist a limited recovery process in such highly degraded conditions This general pattern also suggests the necessity for long-term commitment among a broad set of social actors combined to mitigation of degradation in adjacent remnants and agricultural lands. Active restoration may be complemented by spontaneous regeneration in areas with less adverse conditions. Policy makers therefore neec to consider the complementarity of lands voluntarily offered for restoration, and land made available for re storation through other mechanisms. Our findings, likely applicable to other densely populated tropical regions suggest that land-use policies need to address drivers of restoration success at a fine-scale to enable effective strategies. We suggest this can be achieved by spatial analyses that incorporate biophysical features that de termine restoration opportunities and the likelihood of success.

TI  - A rapid biological assessment of Lokutu, Democratic Republic of Congo.
T2  - RAP Bulletin of Biological Assessment
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of their high biological diversity and uniqueness, African rainforests are a top global conservation priority (Olson and Dinerstein 1998, Kamdem-Toham et al. 2003, Mittermeier et al. 2004). Forest destruction has been fueled by rapid population growth and also by extensive road building which have greatly increased access to forests (Wilkie and Laporte 2001). The total harvest of wildlife in the Afrotropical region is estimated to be about 5 million tons annually, making this the most intensively hunted tropical region in the world (Fa et al. 2002). Recurring wars, political instability, disease, and endemic corruption have also created serious impediments for African forest conservation. While well over half of all of Africa's rainforests have been cleared and fragmented, Central Africa retains almost 60% of the original forest cover (Naughton-Treves and Weber 2001).The Congo Basin Forest comprises the second largest block of tropical rainforest remaining on Earth. The majority of the Congo Basin Forest lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the third largest country in Africa, covering some 2,344,000 km2 at the center of the continent. DRC is the single most biologically rich country in Africa, and, in terms of species richness, is near the top of the list for Africa for virtually every group of organisms. DRC harbors important communities of megafauna and, resulting from its proximity to the second largest river system on Earth, the Congo, DRC also holds a diverse freshwater fish fauna. Conservation International (CI) has identified the Congo Basin Forest as one of the world's High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas and, as such, a global biodiversity conservation priority. Lokutu - Lokutu, within the Territory of Basoko, DRC, lies on the southern boundary of the northern-most extent of the Congo River (see Map). The Lokutu area still has forests, some of them within Unilever's Lokutu Oil Palm Plantation concession. Lokutu Oil Palm Plantation concession (630 km2) is an active plantation of which ca. 100 km2 are covered with oil palm (and some cocoa and coffee). The remaining ca. 530 km2 are lightly to heavily disturbed. At one time, the Lokutu area was completely covered with lowland moist forest (Grainger 1996). The Plantation has been cleared except for narrow strips of forest along streams and rivers, and two (ca. 50 km2 each) forest blocks in the northwest of the concession. These two blocks, as well as the forests surrounding the plantation, have been selectively logged. Lokutu Plantation employs ca. 1,900 people. The total population of the Lokutu area is ca. 10,000 people. Lokutu is located in the northeastern section of the region south of the Great Bend of the Congo River, sometimes referred to as the Cuvette Centrale. This is also adjacent to the Maringa-Wamba-Lopori landscape, targeted for conservation and development activities under the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP). Despite the high conservation importance of this landscape, there are no formal protected areas in this region. RAP EXPEDITION OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES - The primary objective of this RAP survey was to identify potential areas for long-term investment as part of Conservation International's biodiversity conservation program for the Congo Basin High Biodiversity Wilderness Area. A first short survey of the area around the village of Lokutu in September 2002 examined the opportunity of an involvement of CI into the logging and oil palm concession of Unilever. The purpose of this RAP survey was to investigate the conservation value of the Lokutu area. The specific aims of the expedition were to:* Derive a brief but thorough overview of species diversity within the Lokutu area and evaluate the area's relative conservation importance;* Undertake an evaluation of threats to this biodiversity;* Provide management and research recommendations for this area together with conservation priorities; and * Make RAP data publicly available for decision-makers as well as members of the general public in the DRC and elsewhere, with a view to increasing awareness of this ecosystem and promoting its conservation. The RAP expedition's team of six scientists comprised international scientists specializing in Central Africa's terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. The RAP team examined selected taxonomic groups to determine the area's biological diversity, its degree of endemism, and the uniqueness of the ecosystem. RAP expeditions survey focal taxonomic groups as well as indicator species, with the aim of choosing taxa whose presence can help identify a habitat type and its condition. We chose to survey plants, odonates (dragonflies), amphibians, reptiles, birds, and larger mammals (with a focus on primates). STUDY AREA - We conducted surveys during the dry season in forests within and near Unilever's Lokutu Oil Palm Plantation concession. The surveys were conducted over 14 days (26 October - 8 November, 2004). Surveys focused mainly on four forest sites (see Map, Table 1.1). SUMMARY Of RESULTS - Criteria generally considered during RAP surveys in order to identify priority areas for conservation across taxonomic groups include species richness, species endemism, rare and/or threatened species, and critical habitats. Measurements of species richness can be used to compare the number of species per area among areas within a given region. Measurements of species endemism indicate the number of species endemic to some defined area and give an indication of both the uniqueness of the area and the species that will be threatened by degradation or loss of that area's habitats (or conversely, the species that will likely be conserved through protected areas). Assessment of rare and/or threatened species that are known or suspected to occur within a given area provides an indicator of the importance of the area for the conservation of biodiversity. The presence or absence of such species also aids assessment of their conservation status. Many species listed on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2006) carry increased legal protection, thus giving greater importance and weight to conservation decisions. Describing the number of critical habitats or subhabitats within an area identifies sparse or poorly known habitats within a region that contribute to habitat variety and, therefore, to species diversity. The following is a summary, based on these criteria, of the key findings from our field study.Plants - A total of 485 taxa of indigenous plants and 89 taxa of exotic plants were recorded. The low botanical diversity of the palm plantations is compared with almost primary forest. The most interesting of the timber species was Pericopsis elata or Afrormosia. Considering that the Kisangani area is considered to be the last stronghold of this species, the very low stocking rate noted during this survey suggests that the situation is more serious than previously thought.Odonates (Dragonflies) - A total of 86 taxa of odonates, mostly Guineo-Congolian running-water species, were found. There were several remarkable range extensions, as well as new species of Platycypha, Elattoneura and Mesocnemis. The species richness for odonates in this area is high, especially since only 24 (28%) species are widespread Afrotropical species; the remaining 62 (72%) are Guineo-Congolian species. Of the Guineo-Congolian group, 47% of the species occur almost throughout the Guineo-Congolian realm (i.e., well into West Africa), but the other 53% are more localized, restricted to the forested center of the continent. Thirteen of the species (almost one in six) have yet to be found outside the Congo Basin. The RAP results indicate a healthy watershed in the Lokutu area, with limited degrees of pollution and streambed erosion. If forest cover and natural stream morphology are retained, the rich dragonfly fauna is expected to persist. The species list is especially long considering the paucity of stagnant water species and the absence of certain Congolian endemics. The observed richness is probably typical of the Congo Basin as a whole and other areas are expected to be even richer. Therefore, the Lokutu area does not require specific conservation action as concerns the conservation of the odonate fauna.This RAP survey demonstrated that it is possible to rapidly obtain a clear picture of odonate diversity, even allowing a partial description of their ecology. The rich and apparently largely natural odonate fauna found contrasts with the impoverished status of the other taxonomic groups studied. Therefore, it is recommended to use odonates more frequently to supplement biodiversity assessments of the more traditional taxonomic groups, especially in the Congo Basin, where sampling odonates may show whether existing conservation priorities also protect freshwater diversity. Amphibians and Reptiles - Twenty-one species of amphibians and 16 species of reptiles species of amphibians and 16 species of reptiles were identified. Most species were common savannah or forest species that can adapt to a high level of anthropogenic disturbance. The known distributional range for six amphibian species (Afrixalus equatorialis, Amnirana amnicola, Cardioglossa gratiosa, Dimorphognathus africanus, Hyperolius cf. lateralis and Leptopelis ocellatus) was extended. Given the circumstances of this RAP survey (i.e., inaccessibility of potentially pristine forest patches), the species list reported here does not allow for meaningful conservation commendations. Birds - A total of 204 species of birds were found in the Lokutu area, of which 20 species are Palearctic migrants. No bird species listed as threatened on the 2004 IUCN Red List were encountered. We obtained geographic range extensions for 14 species and one subspecies. Previous logging activity, past and ongoing wide-scale conversion of forests to oil palm plantations and gardens, and heavy hunting pressure were documented. The findings indicate that the Lokutu area is of relatively low value as a site for the conservation of birds. This is due, in part, to a decline in the bird species richness of the site as a result of forest degradation, fragmentation, and clearance, togeof some species. A preliminary list of the birds of the Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary (near Kinshasa) is presented at the end of this report. Mammals - Six species of primates and eight species of large mammals were recorded. Previous logging activity, ongoing wide-scale conversion of forests to oil palm plantations and gardens, and heavy hunting pressure were documented. Hunters claimed that they never observed large mammals such as African elephants, African buffaloes, leopards, or gracile chimpanzees (bonobos). The largest mammal present is the red river hog. The Lokutu area is of little conservation value for the conservation of primates and large mammals due to a considerable decline in the biological richness of the site and the collapse of the primate and large mammal communities. This situation has come about as a result of forest degradation, fragmentation, and clearance, together with unsustainable levels of hunting. CONSERVATION CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS - Given (1) the great loss of biodiversity and other conservation values, (2) the ever increasing human population and concomitant need to exploit the area's natural resources, (3) the lack of interest/will/ability, both of central government and local government, to control and manage the use of the natural resources, and (4) the high costs (both in terms of money and time) of working in the area, we do not find the Lokutu area to be a priority site for conservation investment or action - nor do we recommend that Lokutu be considered part of CI's Congo Basin High Biodiversity Wilderness Area. In other words, there are numerous other forests in equatorial Africa with a far more valuable biodiversity, and with far fewer threats, where much more conservation impact can be achieved for the funds and time invested.Although the necessary permits were obtained from the various ministries in Kinshasa, the local authorities in the Lokutu area had little respect for this authorization, and actively sought out discrepancies - no matter how seemingly insignificant. Central Government has little or no authority in the Lokutu area. This opens the question as to the safety of any financial investment in the area. Based on the above, any investment in this area would be highly risky, not only as far as funding conservation actions is concerned, but also in support of the oil palm industry.If, however, Unilever, or some other source (e.g., USAID), has conservation funds that can only be used for mitigating the negative conservation situation at Lokutu, there are some actions that could be taken. These include: * Establishing active, long-term, family planning and conservation education programs, * Putting into place large community-protected and community-managed conservation areas, together with bushmeat hunter cooperatives, that would allow for recovery of wildlife populations and their sustainable exploitation for bushmeat,* Re-establishing the livestock industry with the aim of replacing a large portion of the bushmeat that is now eaten with beef, goat, sheep and poultry. One of the original objectives of this RAP was to assess the biodiversity over a much wider area, more specifically, of the forests 40 km or more south of Lokutu. We were unable to accomplish this objective due to permit restrictions. Thus, we are unable to say in this report (1) how far south from Lokutu are found the nearest sites of high biodiversity value, (2) what impact the departure of Unilever from Lokutu might have on the survival of that biodiversity, or (3) what kind of conservation strategy would need to be put into place for the Lokutu area in order to conserve any high biodiversity sites that might exist to the south. Thus, an additional conservation recommendation of this report is that all necessary permits be obtained from the central, regional and local government authorities and another survey of about one month be undertaken in the forests located > 40 km to the south of Lokutu.The Congo River is one of Africa's great biological barriers and, as such, the floras and faunas on either side of this River are known to be substantially different. We recommend that more extensive biodiversity surveys be conducted on both sides of the River in the Lokutu area.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on reference values is one of the great demands in ecological restoration, as they enable evaluating the restoration progress and taking adaptive management measures. Here we aimed to: (i) verify whether ecological indicators are influenced by the area of reference ecosystems (mature fragments); (ii) determine reference and comparison values for comparing the restoration progress; and (iii) check how long restoration forests take to reach naturalness values that are like the reference ecosystems (and can therefore be considered restored). We used the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as an object of study and compilated information about 967 secondary, mature and restoration forests in a wide geographical extension. In total, 14 ecological indicators were assessed in a sampling area of 1,928,024 m(2). We used simple linear regression to analyze the data and descriptive statistics for creating the reference and comparison values. We found that ecological indicators were not related to the area of mature fragments. Thus, they are useful for monitoring reference ecosystems of different sizes, and more attention can be given to the degree of conservation of the ecosystems. We defined intermediate and final reference values from secondary and mature forests, respectively. We also established comparison values for several restoration stages using data of planting, assisted and unassisted restoration areas. At the same time, we applied the concept of naturalness in restoration and obtained a continuum of naturalness, which was very useful for tracking the restoration progress. With the reference and comparison values determined, restoration practitioners can evaluate their restoration areas by comparing their monitoring results with ours. Moreover, by using the naturalness concept we verified that indicators can have different restoration trajectories. Some indicators reached similar naturalness levels as references from the beginning of restoration, but others required between one and two decades to recover. This study is the first to create evaluation criteria for forest restoration based on a large data set, and we hope that similar studies can be developed in other biomes.

TI  - Interspecific variation in vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in pioneer and non-pioneer species used in tropical forest restoration
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation projects have gained interest over recent years due to the loss of biodiversity in tropical regions as a result of large deforestation by anthropogenic actions. However, better knowledge on the tolerance of plant species to environmental stresses is needed for reforestation success. Here, we evaluated the photoprotective and antioxidant capacity, in terms of vitamin E accumulation, of five pioneer (Platypodium elegans Vogel, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil, Cecropia pachystachya Tr,cul. and Aegiphila sellowiana Cham.) and five non-pioneer (Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemo, Cedrela fissilis Vell., Genipa americana L., Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. and Hymenaea courbaril L.) species, in relation to the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. Furthermore, we examined differences between sun and shade leaves on vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation. Pioneer plants showed on average 33% higher malondialdehyde levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, than non-pioneer species, but no significant differences in vitamin E contents. In contrast, a marked interspecific variation was observed in the levels of alpha-tocopherol and its precursor, gamma-tocopherol. Natural variation revealed interesting relationships between vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. The pioneer species, P. elegans, did not accumulate alpha-tocopherol and displayed the highest levels of malondialdehyde. Sun and shade leaves accumulated vitamin E levels to a similar extent, except for the pioneer L. pacari and the non-pioneer C. langsdorffii, the former accumulating more alpha-tocopherol in sun leaves and the latter in shade leaves. We conclude that interspecific variation is higher than both leaf type and successional-group variation in terms of vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation, and that vitamin E levels, particularly those of alpha-tocopherol, negatively correlate with the extent of lipid peroxidation, thus supporting a photoprotective and antioxidant function for vitamin E in plants growing in tropical environments.

TI  - Thinning temporarily stimulates tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data.

TI  - Net-zero emission targets for major emitting countries consistent with the Paris Agreement
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 100 countries have set or are considering net-zero emissions or neutrality targets. However, most of the information on emissions neutrality (such as timing) is provided for the global level. Here, we look at national-level neutrality-years based on globally cost-effective 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C scenarios from integrated assessment models. These results indicate that domestic net zero greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions in Brazil and the USA are reached a decade earlier than the global average, and in India and Indonesia later than global average. These results depend on choices like the accounting of land-use emissions. The results also show that carbon storage and afforestation capacity, income, share of non-CO2 emissions, and transport sector emissions affect the variance in projected phase-out years across countries. We further compare these results to an alternative approach, using equity-based rules to establish target years. These results can inform policymakers on net-zero targets. Over 100 countries have set or are considering net-zero emissions targets. Here, the authors show that a country's potential for negative emissions and methodological issues affect when countries can reach net-zero, calling for clear internationally agreed definitions and accounting methods.

TI  - A generalizable monitoring model to implement policies to promote forest restoration - A case study in Sao Paulo - Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Examples of large-scale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries, and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets. Given the increasing investment of time, effort, and money in restoration, there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness. Some countries are already conducting monitoring programs, but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown. Restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties, such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation. With the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects, the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs. The aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes. The Sao Paulo Forest Restoration Program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model. This paper presents the conceptual model, emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs. Based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review, the resulting Forest Management Decisions Support System (FMDSS) embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an auto-updatable knowledge base. The result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the FMDSS. The restoration of degraded areas in a case with > 40,000 rural properties serves as the case study. Although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ, the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations. Additionally, conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes, supported by an auto-updatable knowledge base, mitigate the risk of failures, mainly when the comprehensive gathering of well-established references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset.

TI  - Amazonian dark earths enhance the establishment of tree species in forest ecological restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDeforestation of areas for agriculture and cattle breeding is the leading cause of ecological degradation and loss of biodiversity. The solution to mitigate these damages relies on techniques that improve soil health and the microbial quality of these degraded areas. Here, we demonstrate that the high nutrient and microbiological contents of Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) can promote the development of trees used in ecological restoration projects.MethodsWe used degraded soil from crops as control and ADE from the Central Amazon to conduct the experiment, using 20% of ADE as inoculum in degraded agricultural soil. Our goal was to assess whether a small amount of ADE could promote changes that improve plant development similar to its growth under a 100%ADE. We simulated conversion from pasture to forest restoration area by planting U. brizantha in all pots. After 60 days, we removed it and planted Cecropia pachystachya, Peltophorum dubium, and Cedrela fissilis.ResultsOur results demonstrated that both 20%ADE and 100%ADE treatments increased pasture productivity and, consequently, soil carbon stock. Also, in these treatments, P. dubium and C. fissilis had better growth and development, with 20%ADE plants showing a performance similar to those planted in 100%ADE. Both 20%ADE and 100%ADE showed similar numbers of taxa, being significantly higher than in the control soil.DiscussionThe 20%ADE was sufficient to increase significantly the microbial richness in the soil, providing several beneficial microorganisms to all tree species such as Pedomicrobium, Candidatus Nitrososphaera, and members of Paenebacillaceae. Nevertheless, C. pachystachya, a common pioneer tree in the Amazonian Forest showed a small response even to 100%ADE with a corresponding lower taxa number than the other two species. In conclusion, we point out that microbial structure remains very similar among plants but dissimilar among treatments, highlighting the role of ADE as an enhancer of plant development and beneficial microbiota enrichment in the rhizosphere. The use of 20%ADE was sufficient to alter the microbial community. Therefore, we believe our data could contribute to speeding up forest restoration programs by adopting new biotechnological approaches for forest restoration ecology.

TI  - Indigenous tenure security and local participation in climate mitigation programs: Exploring the institutional gaps of REDD plus implementation in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism faces implementation challenges related to tenure security and governance institutions. In response, multiple regional climate mitigation initiatives have emerged. In Peru, indigenous networks have created their own Indigenous Amazonian REDD (RIA), an initiative aiming to strengthen property rights for native peoples. At roughly the same time, the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Program (PNCB), a conditional payment scheme aiming to encourage sustainable forest management. However, these initiatives must still overcome fragmented institutional governance of forests at the regional scale and continued challenges related to indigenous tenure security. This article examines how indigenous federations and the Peruvian government are attempting to implement these initiatives in the Amazonian region of Madre de Dios to examine how challenges play out in practice. These cases illustrate the institutional gaps between national policies, regional capacities, and local needs and expectations. However, it also demonstrates how an innovative institutional partnership at the subnational scale may be overcoming some of these challenges.

TI  - State of the art and for remote sensing monitoring of carbon dynamics in African tropical forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - African tropical forests play a crucial role in global carbon dynamics, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation, yet monitoring their structure, diversity, carbon stocks and changes remains challenging. Remote sensing techniques, including multi-spectral data, lidar-based canopy height and vertical structure detection, and radar interferometry, have significantly improved our ability to map forest composition, estimate height and biomass, and detect degradation and deforestation features at a finer scale. Machine learning approaches further enhance these capabilities by integrating multiple data sources to produce improved maps of forest attributes and track changes over time. Despite these advancements, uncertainties remain due to limited ground-truth validation, and the structural complexity and large spatial heterogeneity of African forests. Future developments in remote sensing should examine how multi-sensor integration of high-resolution data from instruments such as Planet, Tandem-X, SPOT and improved AI methods can refine forest composition, carbon storage and function maps, enhance large-scale monitoring of tree height and biomass dynamics, and improve forest degradation and deforestation detection down to tree level. These advancements will be essential for supporting science-based decision-making in forest conservation and climate mitigation.

TI  - Multi-Scalar Governance for Restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: A Case Study on Small Landholdings in Protected Areas of Sustainable Development
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of forest restoration projects requires cross-scale and hybrid forms of governance involving the state, the market, civil society, individuals, communities, and other actors. Using a case study from the Atlantic Forest Hotspot, we examine the governance of a large-scale forest restoration project implemented by an international non-governmental organization (NGO) on family farmer landholdings located within protected areas of sustainable development. In addition to forest restoration, the project aims to provide an economic benefit to participating farmers by including native species with market potential (fruits, timber) in restoration models and by contracting farmers in the planting phase. We employed qualitative methods such as structured interviews and participant observation to assess the effect of environmental policy and multi-scalar governance on implementation and acceptability of the project by farmers. We demonstrate that NGO and farmer expectations for the project were initially misaligned, hampering farmer participation. Furthermore, current policy complicated implementation and still poses barriers to project success, and projects must remain adaptable to changing legal landscapes. We recommend increased incorporation of social science methods in earlier stages of projects, as well as throughout the course of implementation, in order to better assess the needs and perspectives of participants, as well as to minimize trade-offs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable forest management are important tools to,improve the quality of forest management. In most cases they have been developed by experts, but the participation of stakeholders is essential if the C&I are to be locally relevant and practicable. We asked four stakeholder groups to apply a set of C&I to a forest management unit in the eastern Amazon basin. The study confirmed the importance of involving stakeholders and demonstrated that effective efforts begin with well-defined and clearly understandable C&I. Stakeholders were better able to apply and adapt measurable verifiers than the more abstract indicators and criteria. Intensive communication about personal experiences and subjective interpretations is necessary to prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations, Our study also confirmed the general practical applicability of C&I and revealed their potential as instruments of communication and learning.

TI  - Status of Sumatran Tiger in the Berbak-Sembilang landscape (2020)
T2  - Journal of Threatened Taxa
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the status of the Critically Endangered Sumatran Tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae is a key component for assessing the effectiveness of conservation interventions, and thus informing and adapting strategic planning for the remaining 600 Sumatran Tigers on the island. The Berbak-Sembilang National Park is an integral part of the priority Berbak-Sembilang Tiger Conservation Landscape, in a unique habitat of mixed peat and freshwater swamp in eastern Sumatra. Our camera trap survey covered both the Berbak and Sembilang Tiger Core Areas (BTCA, STCA) over a period of 10 years, with surveys undertaken in 2010, 2015, 2018-2019. The most recent population density estimates (BTCA 1.33 adults/100 km(2), 95% CI 0.82-1.91 with 19 adults; and STCA 0.56 adults/100 km(2), 95% CI 0.45-0.89 with five adults) confirmed a small but stable population. A landscape level management approach is a priority for tiger population recovery, consolidating ground-based protection and establishing a well-maintained fire management system with reforestation of affected areas along with multi-stakeholder engagement and partnerships. The study also recommends extending the BTCA to include the primary swamp forest in the north of the national park, based on evidence from camera trap surveys.

TI  - Enhancing Water Ecosystem Services Using Environmental Zoning in Land Use Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes alter the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, impacting the potential and flow of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration projects aiming to enhance native vegetation have proven effective in mitigating the impacts of LULC changes on ecosystem services. A key element in implementing these projects has been identifying priority areas for restoration, considering that resources allocated to such projects are often limited. This study proposes a novel methodological framework to identify priority areas for restoration and guide LULC planning to increase the provision of water ecosystem services (WESs) in a watershed in southeastern Brazil. To do so, we combined biophysical models and multicriteria analysis to identify priority areas for ecological restoration, propose environmental zoning for the study area, and quantify the effects of LULC changes and of a planned LULC scenario (implemented environmental zoning) on WES indicators. Previous LULC changes, from 1985 to 2019, have resulted in a nearly 20% increase in annual surface runoff, a 50% increase in sediment export, a 22% increase in total nitrogen (TN) export, and a 53% increase in total phosphorus (TP) export. Simultaneously, they reduced the provision of WESs (baseflow -27%, TN retention -10%, and TP retention -16%), except for sediment retention, which increased by 35% during the analyzed period. The planned LULC scenario successfully increased the provision of WESs while reducing surface runoff and nutrient and sediment exports. The methodology employed in this study proved to be effective in guiding LULC planning for improving WES. The obtained results provide a scientific foundation for guiding the implementation of WES conservation policies in the studied watershed. This method is perceived to be applicable to other watersheds.

TI  - Grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus affect Collembola communities and soil functions in southern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical-chemical parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation). While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures. Our results on afforestation effects in subtropical grasslands are similar to those described for temperate zone, and may underpin the development of conservation strategies for land-use on subtropical grasslands.

AB  - Profile of dielectric constant of a substance or a surface indicates its electromagnetic parameters. The profile is associated with electric polarization, permeability with magnetic polarization, and conductivity with an electric current field. In the practice, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) are commonly utilized to determine how much velocity of a substance and its scattering profiles. However, information about the profile radar scattering mechanisms in tropical peatland is still limited. Therefore, we evaluated dielectric constant from the field using GPR and estimated its spatial variation from a dual-polarization Sentinel-1A type C-band SAR in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatera Province, Indonesia. We measured dielectric constant at the two major types of land use, namely oil palm and acacia. Results indicated that the dielectric constant derived from SAR Sentinel-1A and GPR are affected by peat moisture. It increases as the peat moisture increases. Results show that during peat dry conditions, the profiles of dielectric constant derived from dual-pol Sentinel-1A images are relatively similar to the dielectric constant of peat in Siak Regency. It ranges between 31.78 and 59.3. The dielectric constant derived from GPR ranges between 69 and 70.

TI  - Atlantic Forest restoration recovers physical and biological properties in the short term, but not the general soil quality
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has the potential to improve and recover soil quality, helping to mitigate soil degradation worldwide. However, soil monitoring is often overlooked in restoration, preventing a comprehensive understanding of how restoration interventions affect soil quality and the time required for recovering different soil properties. Herein, we tested if MAR areas (moderately assisted recovery-tree plantings) in the early restoration stage have better soil quality (and ecosystem services) than UNR areas (unassisted natural recovery-abandoned pastures) and pastures in continuous use (PCU). We collected 72 soil samples in three 5-year-old MAR areas and three 5-year-old UNR areas, one PCU, and one reference ecosystem (RE) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica). A total of 45 variables representing macrofauna, fertility, structure, and aggregation were measured and then submitted to multivariate analyses to compute sub-indicators and a general indicator of soil quality (GISQ). The richness of orders and classes, cationic exchange capacity, total porosity, and biogenic aggregates contributed the most to the sub-indicators. MAR and UNR areas had similar values to the RE for macrofauna, structure, and aggregation sub-indicators, but they were far below the RE for fertility. In addition, all areas had lower GISQ values than the RE. Soils were classified as high quality in RE and medium quality in other areas. Our study evidences that some soils' physical and biological properties can be rapidly recovered through forest restoration, but 5 years is not enough time to change the general soil quality and make restoration areas have better conditions than the previous land use. If the restoration goal is to have high soil quality in the short term, corrective actions should be taken to improve soil fertility and help the area along the desired trajectory.

TI  - Institutional bricolage of Sustainable Forest Management implementation in rural settlements in Caatinga biome, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) implementation strategies articulate different aims, goals, and interests across different scales of governance and social-ecological contexts. When SFM is implemented in common pool or public forests, governmental initiatives play a central role in defining formal institutions that will interact with the local social-ecological context. At the same time, local actors' practices of governing common pools forests are also a key factor in SFM implementation. This article uses a critical institutionalism lens to analyse how interactions between a new set of formal institutions with pre-existing local institutions result in (un) expected governance outcomes when implementing SFM on the ground. Using the Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil as a case study, it shows how local actors (bricoleurs) perform institutional bricolage processes by rejecting, adapting, or integrating institutions linked to SFM implementation strategies to their social-ecological contexts. The article is based on a qualitative data analysis from twenty interviews with local and governmental actors, and nine site visits to rural settlements and industries. It concludes that formal SFM institutions in Caatinga do not dialogue with all the different roles that forests resources have in the livelihood of local actors, but rather have a dominant focus on the production of forest biomass for energy supply. Moreover, we found that the success of SFM implementation is highly dependent on the interactions amongst local actors within the social-ecological context. Accordingly, positive results are only achieved when these interactions help to face implementation challenges, specifically those linked to bureaucracy and to technical capacity.

TI  - A novel energy systems model to explore the role of land use and reforestation in achieving carbon mitigation targets: A Brazil case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its low global share of direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (1-2%), the implications of technological transitions in the agricultural and forestry sector on the energy system have been overlooked. This paper introduces the Agriculture and Land Use Sector module part of the ModUlar energy System Environment (MUSE), a novel energy system simulation model. The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways. To illustrate the model's capabilities, Brazil is used as case study. Outputs suggest that by 2030 under a 2 degrees C mitigation scenario, most of Brazil agricultural production would move from 'transitional' to 'modern' practices, improving productivity and reducing deforestation rates, at the expense of higher energy and fertiliser demand. By mid-century Brazil has the potential to liberate around 24.4 Mha of agricultural land, where large-scale reforestation could have the capacity to sequester around 5.6 GtCO(2), alleviating mitigation efforts in the energy system, especially reducing carbon capture and storage technology investments in the industry and power sector.

TI  - Economic Value of Environmental Services Regulating Flow and Maintaining Water Quality in the Piracicaba River Basin, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - From distributed or semidistributed hydrological models, it is possible to identify where land use decisions can bring greater economic benefits in relation to water use. This study aimed to integrate simulations of a hydrological model varying the land use in four reforestation scenarios that influence the economic benefits of provision environmental services, including the user's alternatives as a key parameter and finally estimating the economic value of such benefits. The "avoided costs" method was used for economic valuation of flow regularization service and adequacy of water quality in the Piracicaba River basin, aiming to generate various economic instruments to support decision makers. The cost for water storage was estimated from the rising rain volume infiltrating the soil from the change in the dynamics of land use, whereas the cost of maintaining water quality was obtained from the variation between the effects of scenarios in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads. The valuation methodology allowed us to estimate the avoided costs, which will mainly contribute to application of economic instruments to manage water resources, directing land use decisions in hydrographic basins, guiding environmental impact assessment studies, and the definition of mitigation measures.

TI  - Leaching of sulfentrazone in soils of reforestation in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study determined the mobility of sulfentrazone in soils used for reforestation (Haplic Planosol, Ultisol, Humic Cambisol, and Regolithic Neosol) in the south of Brazil. To form the soil columns, previously prepared PVC tubes (10-cm diameter and 50-cm long) were filled with soil samples. Sulfentrazone was applied on top of the columns, which contained soil with moisture close to the field capacity. Subsequently, simulated 60-mm rainfall was applied to the columns. After draining the water, the columns were opened, and soil samples of each segment of 5.0 cm of the columns were taken for analysis of sulfentrazone by high-performance liquid chromatography. The herbicide was extracted from the soils by the solid-liquid extraction method with low temperature partition (SLE-LTP), which was adapted and validated. Sulfentrazone showed high mobility in the four soils analyzed, but presented lower mobility in the Humic Cambisol due to its lower rate of desorption. In this soil, the herbicide remained in the upper layers of the column, while in the other soils the herbicide was distributed throughout the columns. The soil that held the highest concentration of the compound in the first two segments of the column (0-5 and 5-10 cm) was the one with the highest clay content. Thus, it was concluded that the sulfentrazone leaching process in the soils analyzed is dependent on the chemical and physical characteristics of the soils, particularly, the contents of clay, sand, and organic matter.

TI  - Rapid Response of Bird Communities to Small-Scale Reforestation in Indonesian Borneo.
T2  - Tropical Conservation Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha) community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by 29% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site) were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of biodiversity offsets to achieve net gain
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the outcomes and tracking the trajectory of biodiversity offsets is essential to demonstrating their effectiveness as a mechanism to conciliate development and conservation. We reviewed the literature to determine the principles that should underpin biodiversity offset planning and the criteria for offset evaluation at the project level. According to the literature, the core principles of equivalence, additionality, and permanence are used as criteria to evaluate conservation outcomes of offsets. We applied the criteria to evaluate offsets of a large iron ore mining project in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. We examined equivalence in terms of the amount of area per biodiversity value affected and fauna and flora similarity, additionality in terms of landscape connectivity, and permanence in terms of guarantees to ensure protection and restoration offsets lasting outcomes. We found an offset ratio (amount of affected area:offset area) of 1:1.8 for forests and 1:2 for grasslands. Ecological equivalence (i.e., similarity between affected and offset areas) was found for forested areas, but not for ferruginous rupestrian grasslands or for fauna. Landscape metrics showed that connectivity improved relative to the preproject situation as a result of locating restoration offsets in the largest and best-connected forest patch. Permanence of offsets was addressed by establishing covenants and management measures, but financial guarantees to cover maintenance costs after mine closure were lacking. Offsets should be equivalent in type and size, provide conservation outcomes that would not be obtained without them (additionality), and be lasting (permanence). To monitor and evaluate offsets, it is necessary to determine how well these 3 principles are applied in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of offsets. Achieving measurable conservation outcomes from offsets is a long-term endeavor that requires sustained management support, and is information intensive. Thus, offsets require ongoing monitoring and evaluation as well as adaptive management.

TI  - Regeneration response of Brazilian Atlantic Forest woody species to four years of Megathyrsus maximus removal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5 x 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10 cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guineagrass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives.

TI  - Forest restoration after severe degradation by coal mining: lessons from the first years of monitoring
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration after mining often requires strong interventions, including soil reconstruction, which makes vegetation establishment a challenge. We analyzed regeneration of woody plant species in the first years of restoration in areas severely degraded by coal mining in the south Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. At the four restoration sites, we collected data on cover of the herbaceous layer (including invasive grasses) and on abundance and richness of introduced trees and of spontaneously establishing woody plants. We also evaluated soil chemical features at all sites. We compared functional characteristics of the woody regeneration with nearby forest remnants (target communities) and evaluated the dynamics of regeneration over 3 years by principal coordinates analyses. The influence of biotic and abiotic variables for the regeneration of woody species was analyzed by partial redundancy analysis. We found high variation in community composition and structure among restored sites. Most of this variation was explained by variables related to soil chemistry and introduced trees. Over time, an increase in woody species establishment could be observed, and woody species communities appear to be at the start of trajectories toward target communities. Fertilization of soil, as commonly applied in restoration, seems to increase cover of exotic grasses, which clearly impedes the development of planted trees and woody species regeneration. Although the restoration of abandoned mining areas is a challenge due to the severe degradation, our results-despite the short period of observation-allow for the conclusion that restoration is possible, even with high initial costs. We highlight the importance of monitoring the initial process of restoration and of (re) defining intermediate goal and project targets, following an adaptive management approach.

TI  - Assessing the impact of soil use and management systems on soil health in Southern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing demand for adopting more sustainable agricultural management practices worldwide has prompted soil health assessment studies. In southern Brazil, there is a growing diversification in soil use and management systems. This study aimed to evaluate soil health under different soil use and management systems in this region using the Soil Management Assessment Framework. The study investigated secondary forest, no-tillage, and pasture across three mesoregions of Parana<acute accent> State: West, Southwest, and Central East. Soil health was evaluated in the surface layer, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of soil use and management on soil health. Scores for bulk density, water-filled pore space, pH, phosphorus, potassium, microbial biomass carbon, and beta-glucosidase activity were sensitive to detecting changes in soil conditions. However, other indicators, such as macroaggregate stability and total organic carbon, need refined algorithms for regional adaptation. Differences in soil health among soil use and management were observed. Secondary forest generally maintained optimal soil health indices, with values above 0.86. No-tillage showed good soil health indices in the evaluated layer, with values above 0.80. Notably, no-tillage with organic agricultural systems and the application of organic residues appeared to contribute positively to soil health improvement, with indices reaching 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. Pastures, especially silvopasture, showed potential for improving soil health through plant diversity, achieving an index of 0.88. We suggest that future studies compare different soil health indices to improve algorithms for interpreting soil health indicators on a regional scale.

TI  - Sipongi System: Navigating and fostering collaboration in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sipongi System is essential in dealing with forest and land fires because this system provides real-time data that empowers stakeholders and communities to proactively overcome fire dangers. Its advantages are seen in its ability to provide detailed information regarding weather conditions, wind patterns, water levels in peatlands, air quality, and responsible work units. This data facilitates efficient decision-making and resource allocation for fire prevention and control. As an embodiment of Collaborative Governance, the Sipongi System actively involves various stakeholders, including government institutions, local communities, environmental organizations and the private sector. This cooperative approach fosters collective responsibility and accountability, improving fire management efforts. The Sipongi approach is critical in reducing forest and land fires in Indonesia by providing real-time data and a collaborative governance model. This results in faster response times, more effective fire prevention and better resource allocation. Although initiallydesigned for Indonesia, the adaptable nature of the system makes it a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in other countries and regions, tailored to specific needs and environmental conditions. Qualitative research methods underlie this study, including interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of credible sources. Government officials, community leaders, environmental experts and organizational representatives were interviewed to comprehensively examine the mechanisms of the Sipongi System and its impact on forest and land fire management in Indonesia. Future research should explore the application of Sipongi Systems and collaborative governance in various contexts by conducting comparative studies across countries and ecosystems. Additionally, assessing the long-term impact and sustainability of the Sipongi System is critical to evaluating its effectiveness over time

TI  - Rice yield enhancement and environmental sustainability with precision nutrient management
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rice agriculture faces challenges related to incorrect fertilizer use and the inappropriate application of improved varieties. Site-specific nutrient management offers a viable method for modifying fertilizer usage in alignment with the distinct needs of various rice cultivars and the prevailing soil conditions. This study investigated the effects of site-specific nutrient management on the growth and productivity of adaptable-modified rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) in Semarang, IndonesiaAdditionally, it analyzed the agronomic and economic outcomes of implementing site-specific nutrient management versus traditional fertilization practices. METHODS: The three varieties, Inpari-6 (V1), Hipa-5 (V2), and local (V3) were tested with a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Fertilizer treatments included the Ministry of Agriculture recommendations (P1), site-specific fertilizer using a soil test kit (P2), and farmer's fertilization practices (P3). The data obtained consisted of growth indicators, yield elements, and economic efficiency. FINDINGS: The results showed that the combination of site-specific fertilization (P2) and Inpari-6 produced the highest number of productive tillers (16) and yielded 7.4 ton per hectares of milled dry grain, increasing productivity by 39.6 percent. The integration of this combination led to the highest decrease in nitrogen fertilizer application and improved profit margins, achieving a profit difference of 42.8 percent relative to the fertilization practices typically used by farmers. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of site-specific nutrient management in optimizing resource use, decreasing nitrogen runoff, and elevating rice yields. CONCLUSION: Site-specific nutrient management outperformed the traditional fertilization methods, especially when combined with the Inpari-6 variety. These findings support using site-specific nutrient management as a long-term strategy to increase yields, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance economic returns. More extensive studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of site-specific nutrient management on both the environment and agronomy in different rice cultivation regions

TI  - Reconciling rural development and ecological restoration: Strategies and policy recommendations for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased demand for both agricultural production and forest restoration may lead to increased competition for land in the next decades. Sustainably increasing cattle ranching productivity is a potential solution to reconcile different land uses, while also improving biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. If not strategically implemented in integration with complementary policies, sustainable intensification can however result in negative environmental, economic and social effects. We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land. Our study shows that results from socioeconomic interviews and biophysical modelling of potential productivity increases offer robust insights into practical solutions on how to pursue sustainable development in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots.

TI  - Large-scale forest restoration generates comprehensive biodiversity gains in an Amazonian mining site
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To reconcile environmental issues with socioeconomic development, the mitigation hierarchy emerges as a pivotal strategy that sequentially addresses environmental impacts through a structured approach of avoidance, minimization, remediation, and offsetting. No net loss (NNL) is achieved when biodiversity gains from all four mitigation stages are larger than the project's environmental impacts. Here, we assessed biodiversity changes linked to the implementation of the S11D Eliezer Batista iron mining Complex in the Caraj ' as National Forest, Par ' a state, Brazil, expecting losses due to mining activities and gains through forest restoration offsets. We evaluated biodiversity stocks based on Biotic Value as the product of habitat importance and actual conditions. Habitat importance, a unique value for each class of land cover recognized within the study site, is based on the evaluation of habitat naturalness, rarity and endangerment, and substitutability. Actual conditions are computed from field-surveyed key ecological attributes of vegetation structure, community composition and diversity, and ecological processes, and forest restoration activities are able to restitute, within 4-6 years only, approximately 73 % of old-growth forest conditions. The Biotic Value ranges from 0 for mine lands to 1 for patchy savanna formations stocking above ironstone outcrops (locally known as cangas) and amounts to 0.43 units/ha for secondary forests. Between 2008 and 2021, we detected comprehensive land-use changes in the study area: Cangas, farmlands and old-growth forests decreased, while secondary forests and minelands increased considerably. Despite environmental degradation, the emergence of secondary forests contributed to a positive biodiversity balance within the areas managed by the mining company (+379 units), while biodiversity losses dominated outside the company's boundaries (-171 units). Although like-for-like compensation of canga impacts remains challenging, we thus conclude that forest restoration efforts initiated by the mining company effectively reversed the trajectory of environmental degradation prevailing in the landscape and provided considerable biodiversity gains for the region.

TI  - Forest restoration monitoring through digital processing of high resolution images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources.

T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, efforts were made to mitigate invasive marine algae and repurpose it as an agricultural resource. We used interviews and participant observation with farmers to analyze possible benefits and tradeoffs of adopting algal soil inputs, with attention to labor patterns, nutrient sources and efficiency, soil health, and productivity. Conventional and organic growers were interested in composted algae to improve soil organic matter, and the fertilizer value of liquid anaerobic digestate, but algal levels declined unexpectedly. Should levels resurge, organizations that conduct boundary work between farmers and conservation agencies will enable its wider use as a soil amendment.

TI  - Ecological indicators of passive restoration in South Brazil's Atlantic Forest areas with former Pinus taeda L. plantations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural regeneration and the restoration course. However, most developed restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014) formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover, dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas.

TI  - Analysis of environmental degradation in Maceio-Alagoas, Brazil via orbital sensors: A proposal for landscape intervention based on urban afforestation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In decades, Brazilian cities have undergone profound changes, accentuated after implementing public policies such as Programa de Aceleracao do Crescimento (PAC) and Minha Casa Minha Vida (PMCMV). This article assessed the urban expansion in the Benedito Bentes (BB) district, Maceio, Brazil, during 1987-2017. The objectives of this investigation were: i) to assess the environmental degradation from the urban advance and the land use/cover (LULC) via orbital sensors products (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, Land Surface Temperature LST and CO2 Flux) for the following years (09/03/1987, 09/07/2003, 10/21/2012 e 12/14/2017); and ii) propose a landscape intervention based on native urban afforestation. The NDVI appointed a drastic reduction of vegetation between 1987 and 2003, from 23.3 km(2) to 4.8 km(2). On the other hand, LST values showed a significant increase between 1987 and 2017, from 22.1 +/- 0.6 degrees C to 26.9 +/- 2.1 degrees C, in some BB areas, these values were higher than 30 degrees C. Regarding the estimate of CO(2)Flux, in average terms, in 1987 were absorbed 3.5 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1), and in 2017 started emitting 0.4 mu mol.m(-2)s(-1). These Brazilian government programs minimized the housing deficit from a socio-economic perspective. However, this rapid urbanization without sustainable planning contributed to increased LST, changed the local LULC and microclimate. The solution to this problem can be the mitigation via urban reforestation from plantings of native trees (Bauhinia forficata, Bauhinia variegata, Caesalpinia leiostachya, and Cassia spectabilis) in an area of higher population circulation to reduce the urban heat island effects.

AB  - In this study, tweets related to fires in Riau, Sumatra, were identified using carefully selected keywords for the 2014-2019 timeframe. The TAGGS algorithm was applied, which allows for geoparsing based on the user's nationality and hometown and on direct referrals to specific locations such as name of province or name of city in the message itself. Online newspapers covering Riau were analyzed for the year 2019 to provide additional information about the reasons why fires occurred and other factors, such as impact on people's health, animal mortality related to ecosystem disruption, visibility, decrease in air quality and limitations in the government firefighting response. Correlation analysis between meteorological information, Twitter activity and satellite-derived hotspots was conducted. The existing approaches that BMKG and other Indonesian agencies use to detect fire activity are reviewed and a novel approach for early fire detection is proposed based on the crowdsourcing of tweets. The policy implications of these results suggest that crowdsourced data can be included in the fire management system in Indonesia to support early fire detection and fire disaster mitigation efforts.

TI  - The legacy of colonial fire management policies on traditional livelihoods and ecological sustainability in savannas: Impacts, consequences, new directions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land occupation and management systems have defined fire regimes and landscapes for millennia. The savanna biome is responsible for 86% of all fire events, contributes to 10% of the total carbon emissions annually and is home to 10% of the human population. European colonization has been associated with the implementation of fire suppression policies in many tropical savanna regions, markedly disrupting traditional fire management practices and transforming ecosystems. In this paper we assess savanna burning approaches from pre-colonial to contemporary eras in three regions: northern Australia, southern Africa and Brazil. In these regions, fire suppression policies have led to (i) conflicts between government authorities and local communities; (ii) frequent late dry season wildfires and/or (iii) woody encroachment. Such consequences are facilitating changes to fire management policies, including recognition and incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary community-based adaptive savanna fire management. Such programs include implementation of prescribed early dry season fires and, in some regions, generating income opportunities for rural and traditional communities through the reduction of late dry season wildfires and associated greenhouse gas emissions. We present a brief history of fire management policies in these three important savanna regions, and identify ongoing challenges for implementation of culturally and ecologically sustainable fire management policies.

TI  - Strategies for mitigating forest arson and elephant conflict in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Indonesia are disappearing at an alarming rate, because the large population of poor rural people require land for agriculture. In Indonesia, forest fire is used to clear land and for protest, indirectly increasing opportunities for human-elephant interaction. Human-elephant conflict is a problem for elephant conservation and human wellbeing in all areas where elephants and humans compete for space, and is most severe in Asia. This paper presents a case study of poor rural people living near Way Kambas National Park, on the island of Sumatra. The park is valued for its critically endangered and endangered mega-fauna, but is a hotspot for both forest arson and human-elephant conflict. We describe the multifactorial conflict happening in the park, which involves arson, poaching, police brutality, and violation of elephants. Workshops with villagers and park stakeholders reveal villager-park interaction, and expose multiple levels of resentment and vicious retribution. Villagers resent the park for a multitude of reasons and take direct action, burning the park and killing elephants. We conclude that saving Way Kambas National Park will ultimately require construction of a barrier preventing human and elephant movement in and out of the park. However in the immediate term, successful conservation must understand and address villager-park conflict, respond to threats of arson, and help villagers protect farms from elephants.

AB  - The conversion of peat swamp forest and peatlands is generally caused by the use of fire in land preparation, which is at risk of triggering uncontrolled forest and land fires. Even though the Indonesian government has explicitly banned the use of fire in clearing peatland for agriculture since 2014, which was stated on government regulation number 71 of 2014 concerning the protection and management of peat ecosystems, people still use fire in land preparation because it is cheap. This research investigated how do the community of Rengas Merah-Riding and Senasih Mulya-Kayu Labu, Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, adapt to the "zero burnings" policy? In-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed using tabulation and a qualitative descriptive approach The results of the study indicated that by the prohibition on the use of fire in land clearing, the community has tried to adapt it even though it cannot be fully implemented. The local communities of research site have alternative livelihoods without using fire, which is "bekarang" (fishing) (both site), developing edible bird nest (both site), and making "purun" mat crafts (only in Senasi Mulya-Kayu Labu). The results of the study are expected to be a valid promotion for local livelihoods without burning, as an element of community livelihoods revitalization within the framework of peat restoration programs.

TI  - Effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on lizard communities in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of human altered landscapes affects biodiversity on every continent. A fundamental goal of conservation biologists is to understand why certain species are at risk of extinction while others are able to persist in human altered landscapes. Afforestation, the conversion of unforested lands to planted forest, is rapidly altering many natural landscapes worldwide. In the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), a global biodiversity hotspot, a shortage of government incentives has the landscape riddled with abandoned plantation forests that are not subject to active restoration projects. Studies investigating the impacts of abandoned plantations on biodiversity are strikingly limited. We examine the effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on the structure of Cerrado lizard communities. We assessed changes in lizard capture, richness and equitability along cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus transects. Our results indicate abandoned Eucalyptus plantations have subsets of Cerrado species persisting with a great loss of endemic species. The cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus linear transect analysis demonstrated distance from native habitat is positively correlated with loss of biodiversity. We performed correspondence analyses to summarize the variation in species captures across different sites, habitats and pitfall array positions. These analyses depicted strong species associations between habitats and their pitfall array positions. This study is the first to show the negative impacts of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on Cerrado lizard communities, serving as a cautionary tale of Cerrado biodiversity non-resilience in abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Mitigation requires that abandoned Eucalyptus plantations are made more suitable to Cerrado lizards by implementing targeted habitat heterogeneity restoration.

TI  - Integrated fire management in a tropical biosphere reserve: Achievements and challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are among the most critical threats to tropical rainforests. In the Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican state of Chiapas, vast rainforest areas suffered destruction by fires in 1998 and 2003. However, there have been no more widespread fires, and previously burnt areas have been recovering. The present study analyses the integrated fire management processes implemented in the reserve. It includes 19 expert interviews and a survey applied to 274 inhabitants of local communities. It argues that the successful prevention of further adverse wildfire events is related to a fire management approach, which emphasizes cultural and physical fire prevention and incorporates strong participation by local communities. The communities have established internal agreements to mitigate wildfire risk. Thus, the reserve might serve as an example of how integrated and cultural fire management can be applied in practice. However, these achievements face challenges, mainly due to budget cuts, changing governmental priorities, and the crisis of the rule of law in Mexico. An event that particularly impacted fire management practices in the area in recent years was the implementation of the federal government's Sembrando Vida ("Planting Life") program. First, it led to deforestation and the provocation of wildfires but afterwards it seems to have induced the abandonment of agricultural burning by a considerable percentage of local farmers.

TI  - Shifts in composition of avian communities related to temperate-grassland afforestation in southeastern South America
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation of temperate grasslands with fast-growing trees for industrial pulpwood production is spreading in South America. Despite high afforestation rates resulting from governmental policies that stimulate pulpwood production in grasslands of southern Brazil and Uruguay, the impact of this activity on biodiversity remains to be properly assessed. We used an Impact-Reference study design to evaluate how grassland afforestation affects the composition of grassland bird assemblages. We sampled eucalyptus plantations and neighboring natural grasslands in southern Brazil from 2006-2009, and relied on nested sampling and analysis to separate the effects of afforestation from the natural variability of grasslands. We recorded a significant difference in composition between assemblages from grasslands and tree plantations. Species adapted to open, treeless areas tended to be negatively affected in relation to edge or forest birds in eucalyptus plantations. Afforestation is systematically replacing the bird assemblage of hilltop grasslands by a collection of common edge and forest species that occur in nearby riverine and hillside forests. Although most grassland birds negatively affected by tree plantations are common and widespread, observed and predicted afforestation rates in southeastern South America may result in regional population reductions in the near future.

TI  - Simulating land use and land cover change under contrasting levels of policy enforcement and its spatially-explicit impact on tropical forest landscapes in Ecuador
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study simulates the future impact of land use and land cover (LULC) change and the enforcement of policy bundles on the multi-functionality of tropical forest landscapes. It focusses on the Northern Ecuadorian Amazonas (NEA) which is characterised by high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time is threatened by deforestation and unsustainable land use practices. Scenario simulations mimic LULC change during 2016-2030 at canton-level (area: 2,146 km2) combining explorative with policy-screening components. Scenarios NATIONAL(+)POLICY, NATIONAL(-)POLICY, REGIONAL(+)POLICY, and REGIONAL(-)POLICY are contrasted by varying deforestation trends (high regional demand for agricultural products vs. national-level structural transformations) and the enforcement/ non-enforcement of policy bundles on forest protection, reforestation and restoration. An indicator-based impact assessment analysed in a spatially-explicit fashion for each scenario in 2030 (i) the evolution of agricultural and forestry-related LULC change trajectories, (ii) future hotspots of deforestation, (iii) remaining forest core zones (FCZ) as key element of habitat integrity, and (iv) the provisioning of long-term carbon sinks. Key findings reveal that only NATIONAL(+)POLICY, as the combination of enforced policy bundles and simulated national LULC change trend extrapolating the long-term reference period 1990-2016, lead to an expansion of forest areas and a 2% carbon stock gain in 2030 compared to 2016. When assuming a linear continuation of this trend, it requires 96 years to reach a similar carbon stock level compared to the reference year 1990. Farm area expansion will continue to affect protected forests in case of scenarios NATIONAL(-)POLICY and REGIONAL(-)POLICY but will be avoided in NATIONAL(+)POLICY and REGIONAL(+)POLICY. The simulated persistence of many farming areas reveals that the likelihood to reforest existing agricultural patches will be rather low. Against expectations, scenario NATIONAL(+)POLICY which assumes net zero deforestation by 2030 led to a high level of FCZ fragmentation contrasting its carbon sink potential (27,971 Mio. Mg ha-1) which performed best among all scenarios. Our study depicts a mismatch of future LULC change realities compared to the anticipated future achievements of the Ecuadorian land use policy framework. The simulated variability of forest change patterns (deforestation, reforestation) and farming trajectories (diversification, intensification, rotation) further suggests to foster more cross-sectoral policy approaches that acknowledges the hybrid role of local stakeholders who can be farmers and forest users at the same time. Our study shows that focusing on preserving carbon stocks and their long-term climate mitigation potential only while neglecting other important ecosystem functions or biodiversity can be a short-sighted policy goal if not accompanied by rural development programmes. We further conclude that scenario-based assessments should become an integral part of multi-stakeholder interactions across relevant levels of decision-making. This can support long-term sustainable land use management which is not only relevant for the case of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazons region but for many other landscapes in transition.

TI  - Sensitivity of different parameters for selection of higher plants in urban afforestation: Exposure of Guabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.) to diesel engine exhaust
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban afforestation can mitigate the effects of air pollution by acting as a sink for atmospheric emissions, but these emissions (e.g., combustion gases from diesel engines) can be a precursor of structural and physiological changes in higher plant species, which could compromise the success of afforestation projects. In this study, Guabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.) plants were exposed in greenhouses to combustion gases emitted by a diesel engine over 120 days, with daily intermittent gas exposure. Every 30 days, leaf injury (chlorosis and necrosis), plant biomass and physiological/biochemical parameters (proteins, chlorophyll and peroxidase enzyme activity) were evaluated. The data obtained were used to construct a hierarchy of the sensitivity (and inversely, of the resistance or tolerance) of this higher plant species to the diesel oil combustion gases: peroxidase > biomass zchlorophyll > protein > leaf injury. Variations in these parameters could be used for the early diagnosis of plant stress or as a marker for stress tolerance in trees. In the first case, a sensitive species could be used for the phytomonitoring of air quality and in the second case the lack of significant variations in these parameters would indicator tolerance of the plant species to air pollution. The results showed that Guabiroba, a plant native to the Atlantic forest, is sensitive to air pollution and could therefore be used for air quality monitoring, since all parameters analyzed were affected by the polluted air.

TI  - Productivity assessment of timber harvesting techniques for supporting sustainable forest management of secondary Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil has been subject to overexploitation in the past prompting the formulation of a rigorous conservation orientated policy by the government including a strict ban of timber harvesting. In the region, the forestland is mostly owned by farmers. The economic value of the forest is rather limited for those farmers, because of the prohibition of commercial timber harvesting as a source of income. Sustainable forest management systems can offer great potential as new income opportunities for land holders, and further actively support the process of ecosystem rehabilitation and protection of these ecosystems. Yet, successful implementation of such sustainable management systems requires feasible and adapted timber harvesting systems. In order to develop such harvesting systems, a regional comparative case study was conducted at a typical smallholder forestry venture with the objective to analyze and evaluate harvesting methods 6 supporting sustainable management of the Atlantic Forest. This study assessed production rates and associated costs of a common conventional timber harvesting method (CM) and a proposed alternative method (AM). CM was performed by a selected, typical forest landowner who had only basic training in chainsaw operations, but 20 years of experience at the wood yard of his small sawmill. In contrast, AM employed a professional chainsaw operator from the Amazon forest, trained and experienced in reduced impact logging techniques using state of the art equipment, supplemented by a snatch block and a skidding cone for improved extraction. Time study based models identified tree volume, winching distance and skidding distance to landing as the most significant independent variables affecting productivity. Total net productivity ranged from 4.9 m(3) PMH0-1 for CM to 3.1 m(3) PMH0-1 ki for AM. Corresponding gross-productivity ranged from 3.0 m(3) SMH-1 to 1 1.9 m(3) SMH-1 with an overall mean utilization rate of 60.8 % and 60.9 %, respectively for CM and AM. Associated harvesting costs ranged from 12.05 m(-3) to 20.94 m-3 with an estimated annual production of 4000 m(3) and 2700 m(3), respectively. Although AM showed overall lower productivity and higher costs, it enabled important improvements in terms of occupational health and safety. In conclusion, a suitable harvesting system should integrate local experiences of CM and proposed technical improvements of AM.

TI  - Alternative biodiesel feedstock systems in the Semi-arid region of Brazil: Implications for ecosystem services
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil has low levels of human development and a marginal environment subject to chronic water scarcity. This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and biofertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multifunctional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare.

TI  - Soil macrofauna in wooded pasture with legume trees
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands afforestation aims at adding different soil uses in a way they become profitable for their owners. As such handling aims at minimizing impacts, the current study had as its goal the use of soil macrofauna in order to evaluate legume afforestation effects on the soil, regardless the depth. Thus, nitrogen fixing species were inserted onto grassland areas and the macrofauna collection was performed 6 years after their planting in the 0-10cm, 10-20cm and 20.30cm layers, in winter and summer. Leguminous influence was different between depths and times of the year. It mostly favors communities under "Mimosa" Genus treetops. Besides, the effects from climatic seasonal variations on invertebrates were mitigated by the implementation of such legume trees.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of Drosophila (Hexapoda, Diptera) in post-mining sites under different forest restoration techniques in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas-Para, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years).

TI  - Farmers' strategies for managing acid upland soils in Southeast Asia: an evolutionary perspective
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The acid soils of the uplands of Southeast Asia have resisted intensive agricultural use for centuries. In recent decades, however, due to rapid population growth, escalating market demand for agricultural produce, and govemment policies for land development and settlement, the acid uplands have become the focus of more intensive land-use systems, placing greater demands on farmers and requiring the development and dissemination of improved practices for soil management. In order to develop appropriate soil management technologies and plan effective interventions to facilitate their adoption, it is important to understand the goals and circumstances of farmers in the acid uplands, the range of farming systems they have developed, and the variety of socio-economic factors and trends influencing the evolution of these farming systems. Building on Boserup's model of agrarian change, an evolutionary framework is developed and applied to five case studies: a long-fallow (shifting) cultivation system in Sarawak, Malaysia; a short-fallow system in South Kalimantan, Indonesia; a continuous cropping system in Bukidnon, Philippines; a tree crop (with intercropping) system in Southern Thailand; a livestock grazing system in Daclac, Vietnam. The framework provides a useful tool to interpret and categorise farmers' evolving soil management strategies and to plan more effective soil management research and interventions.

TI  - Biomass and carbon balance in a dry tropical forest area in northeast Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas.

TI  - Field evaluation of selected soil erosion models for catchment management in Indonesia
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three models, viz., areal non-point source watershed environment response simulation (ANSWERS), universal soil loss equation (USLE) and adapted universal soil loss equation (AUSLE) are evaluated for their performance under the field conditions of the Riam Kanan catchment in South Kalimantan province of Indonesia. While ANSWERS is evaluated for its accuracy to predict both runoff and soil loss, USLE and AUSLE are evaluated for soil loss only. The study was carried out in the context of sedimentation concerns for the Muhammad Nur Reservoir-an important source of drinking and irrigation water supply for the catchment. The models are evaluated using field data collected under four different land uses and during 2 years of field experiments. The land uses considered are cropland with minimum tillage, cropland with conventional tillage, grassland and areas reforested with rubber trees. The ANSWERS model in general has a tendency to overpredict runoff values. The ANSWERS model also was relatively better for predicting soil loss followed by the AUSLE and USLE models. Overall, the ANSWERS model proved superior for predicting soil loss in the Riam Kanan catchment. However, given that the AUSLE model produced sufficiently reliable results and is relatively easy to use, the AUSLE model would also appear to be a useful tool for predicting soil erosion in the catchment.

TI  - Use of artificial perches for wild birds in a degraded area in southern Brazil.
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - . One of the major setbacks in environmental restoration is how to promote the arrival of propagules in degraded areas, and this issue is intensified at sites without vegetation, where natural dispersal is limited. To overcome this issue, one of the methods employed is the use of artificial perches, intended for attracting seeddispersing birds, providing perching sites, and thus, facilitating the formation of vegetation nuclei from the seeds that are excreted, regurgitated, or accidentally dropped. The aim of this study was to quantify and identify the birds that used the artificial perches in a degraded area on the margins of the Forqueta River, RS, Brazil, in order to evaluate their effectiveness as an ecological restoration method. Over one year, 11 bird species were observed to use the perches. Despite the presence of birds, there was no significant seed germination at the base of the perches. Absence of frugivorous species and adverse conditions of the soil might have contributed to this result. Previous studies showed diverging results on the effectiveness of artificial perches, indicating the need for considering several factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of invasive species. The present study highlights the complexity of ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded areas and the importance of adaptive approaches to reach effective results.

TI  - Can the dynamics of forest restoration reduce landscape fragmentation in the Atlantic forest?
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the landscape changes in two forest restoration areas: one adjacent to remaining forest fragments (AA) and the other non-adjacent Brazil. The areas have been previously used for sugarcane cultivation and have undergone restoration interventions involving planting over 30 native species. The satellite images used were from 2011, 2015, and 2019, allowing for the analysis of changes in vegetation cover and landscape fragmentation. The results indicate that both areas experienced an increase in vegetation cover over time, as evidenced by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, adjacent to forest fragments, the AA area exhibited greater ecological connectivity and less fragmentation, resulting in a large forest fragment from 2015 onwards. On the other hand, the non-adjacent ANA area showed slower progress but managed to form a large fragment by 2019, thanks to the presence of planted species such as Mimosa caesalpiniifolia. Moreover, the analysis of fragmentation metrics revealed a reduction in the division index in both areas, which was more pronounced in AA. The supervised classification of the images indicated changes in the restoration areas and their surroundings, with the expansion of classes such as Forest and Exposed. The results highlight the importance of functional connectivity between forest fragments, especially in areas adjacent to remaining fragments, which can accelerate the restoration process and reduce fragmentation. Active restoration, through planting high-density native species, proved effective in rehabilitating forest cover. This study suggests that forest restoration in anthropized areas can mitigate fragmentation, with effects observable in less than a decade, particularly when connecting existing fragments. These findings underscore the importance of implementing restoration strategies that foster connectivity between forest fragments and of continuously monitoring fragmentation metrics to evaluate the efficacy of restoration actions.

TI  - Can partnerships and community-based conservation reverse the decline of coral reef social-ecological systems?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine aquarium trade has played an important role in shaping the ecological state of coral reefs in Indonesia and much of the Asia-Pacific. The use of cyanide by ornamental fishers in Buleleng District, Bali, in the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a precipitous decline in the ecological health of reefs. Cyanide-free harvesting techniques were introduced after 2000, along with reef restoration measures. This paper examines social and ecological processes in the fishing village of Les, Bali, in ending the use of cyanide and the resulting ecological restoration. An emphasis on conservation-development (with livelihood objectives) was important in securing interest and cooperation across stakeholder groups. Adaptive approaches to governance and knowledge co-production were also important. The strategy used at Les is now being exported to other communities across Indonesia, and provides a promising example of a marine resources-based conservation-development initiative that may be implemented at other, similar communities.

TI  - Genetic diversity of reintroduced tree populations of Casearia sylvestris in Atlantic forest restoration sites
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest have shown more concern about genetic variability in floristic diversity in the last years. To create effective conservation policies, we need extensive knowledge on structures and patterns of genetic variation between natural populations and within them. We characterized the genetic population of Casearia sylvestris Swartz in an area under forest restoration processes (Iracemapolis, Sao Paulo) established between 1988 and 1990, and compared it to a natural remnant of semi-deciduous seasonal forest (Caetetus, Sao Paulo). The distance between locations is similar to 210 km. One hundred twenty-eight adult plants were collected, 64 individuals in the native forest remnant and 64 in the restored fragment. The genetic data were generated by the screening of six AFLP primers combinations with a total of 296 loci for each population. The forest restoration site presented overall higher levels of genetic diversity compared to the natural remnant area. The most likely number of genetic clusters found was three (K = 3). The genetic variation was higher within populations, either in the natural or restored site, than between populations. Farther, 25 candidate outlier loci were selected and separated into two groups giving support to future research with species adaptation in these different environments. Our results show that evaluation of restored tree populations of C. sylvestris is crucial to monitoring long-term restoration programs and understand if they persist over time. We hope that our results aim at species management and the establishment of others restoration projects.

TI  - Eucalyptus productive matrix influences the soil seed bank in southern Brazil
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus species are cultivated for various purposes around the world, mainly because they adapt well and grow quickly. These productive matrices of planted forests are common in Brazil, added to which, areas of native vegetation are requirements of environmental legislation. Although eucalyptus plantations are widely distributed in Brazil, little is known about the soil seed bank (SSB) in the eucalyptus productive matrix (EPM). We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6 months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness, composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence, species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants. These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support actions in ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Trade-offs among forest value components in community forests of southwestern Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary conservation interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Metaheuristics applied for storage yards allocation in an Amazonian sustainable forest management area
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the sustainable management of Amazonian forests, it is essential to carry out the optimal planning of logging infrastructures to reduce costs and environmental impacts. However, there is a high degree of complexity due to the number of variables involved. Among these infrastructures, wood storage yards are of utmost importance as they directly influence the opening of forest roads and trails. The objective of this research was to evaluate the allocation of wood storage yards through exact solution and metaheuristics in a forest management area. The study area was a native forest under sustainable forest management regime located in the Brazilian Amazon. Three instances were formulated involving 5947 trees and 3172 wood storage yards facilities. We used a binary integer programming model solved by CPLEX and the metaheuristics Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), Tabu Search (TS), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). GAP values increased as a function of instances. Although all metaheuristics obtained significant solutions with shorter processing times, only SA obtained feasible solutions in all executions for all three instances. In general, the metaheuristics were efficient in obtaining feasible solutions faster than CPLEX, which represents the feasibility of the planning of allocation storage large areas, and without significant losses of best-known solution. The SA presented the best performance in the three evaluated instances. Contribution of this study can be highlighted: evaluation of alternative computational methods for planning the allocation of wooden storage yards; evidence was obtained of effectiveness and efficiency of assessed metaheuristics and, the applicability of approximate methods in this problem was evaluated.

TI  - End of the line for the golden lion tamarin? A single road threatens 30 years of conservation efforts
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads have a myriad of negative effects on biodiversity, ultimately threatening the persistence of populations. In this Perspective we call attention to an extreme example, where the entire current geographic range of the endangered golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia, GLT) is bisected by a major highway that is being widened to four lanes. We believe that the planned mitigation actions are not enough to reduce the expected increase of barrier effects and road mortality. These impacts may lead to a sequence of cascading effects that could jeopardize the conservation actions that prevented the extinction of GLTs three decades ago. We identify specific road sections along the highway and accompanying paved roads in the region that if equipped with tailored over passages would greatly reduce the road barrier effects. We also highlight areas where reforestation efforts could be extended in order to help reestablishing the connectivity between GLT habitat areas. We suggest that the working group integrating key decision makers and stakeholders, including the Non-governmental organization leading the conservation efforts, partner universities, national road and environmental agencies, and the road construction company, to implement and to monitor the complementary road passages to improve connectivity of GLT habitat, and consequently to ensure the species' survival.

TI  - TREE VEGETATION AFFECTING SOIL STABILITY, SOIL POROSITY AND SOIL TOTAL NITROGEN IN THE PROTECTED FOREST OF KULON PROGO COMMUNITY FORESTRY, YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to investigate the influence of tree vegetation on basic soil functions reflected by soil structural stability (SSy), soil porosity (SPy), and soil total nitrogen (STN). Data were collected from 35 plots distributed across five stand types in the protected forest of Kulon Progo Community Forestry, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. (Pinus [PN], Aleurites-Swietenia [AS], Swietenia-Acacia [SA], Melaleuca-Acacia [MA], and Tectona-Dalbergia [TD] stands). Comparative analyses were applied to compare SSy, SPy and STN. The influences of tree vegetation and environmental factors on SSy, SPy and STN were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Our results showed that SSy, SPy and STN varied among plots and stand types where those were directly proportional to each other. Overall, PN stands exhibited less values of basic soil functions than other stands. In this regard, tree vegetation provided high influence on SSy, SPy and STN where the most important factor was an interaction among canopy coverage, soil organic matter and soil organic carbon which are directly proportional to each other and negatively correlated to below -stand utilization. Accordingly, dense -canopy trees are highly recommended for species enrichment by considering adaptive management systems, to ensure the ecological restoration process of degraded forests.

TI  - Topoclimatic Zoning of Three Native Amazonian Forest Species: Approach to Sustainable Silviculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropized areas in the Brazilian Amazon require detailed mapping to identify zones for sustainable use. This study developed a topoclimatic zoning framework to evaluate the conservation and agroforestry potential of three native species: Carapa guianensis (Andiroba), Dipteryx odorata (Cumaru), and Bertholletia excelsa (Amazon Nut). The hypothesis was that integrating topographic and climatic data can effectively identify high-potential areas for these species to support forest restoration and sustainable management. This study applied ecological modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to classify zones into high, medium, and low potential for each species. Results showed Carapa guianensis has high potential in 64% of anthropized areas, Dipteryx odorata in 72% of the Legal Amazon, and Bertholletia excelsa in 58%, highlighting their adaptability and strategic value for restoration efforts. The findings emphasize the importance of topoclimatic zoning as a tool for conservation and sustainable use strategies. By aligning with Brazil's Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Law, this approach can foster agroforestry practices, enhance biodiversity conservation, and strengthen the Amazon bioeconomy, ensuring ecological resilience and sustainable development.

TI  - Characterization of methane emissions from rice fields in Asia. III. Mitigation options and future research needs
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions from rice fields were determined using automated measurement systems in China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Mitigation options were assessed separately for different baseline practices of irrigated rice, rainfed, and deepwater rice. Irrigated rice is the largest source of CH4 and also offers the most options to modify crop management for reducing these emissions. Optimizing irrigation patterns by additional drainage periods in the field or an early timing of midseason drainage accounted for 7-80% of CH4 emissions of the respective baseline practice. In baseline practices with high organic amendments, use of compost (58-63%), biogas residues (10-16%), and direct wet seeding (16-22%) should be considered mitigation options. In baseline practices using prilled urea as sole N source, use of ammonium sulfate could reduce CH4 emission by 10-67%. In all rice ecosystems, CH4 emissions can be reduced by fallow incorporation (11%) and mulching (11%) of rice straw as well as addition of phosphogypsum (9-73%). However, in rainfed and deepwater rice, mitigation options are very limited in both number and potential gains. The assessment of these crop management options includes their total factor productivity and possible adverse effects. Due to higher nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, changes in water regime are only recommended for rice systems with high baseline emissions of CH4. Key objectives of future research are identifying and characterizing high-emitting rice systems, developing site-specific technology packages, ascertaining synergies with productivity, and accounting for N2O emissions.

TI  - Genetic diversity of reintroduced tree populations in restoration plantations of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genesthe basic constituent of biodiversity.

TI  - Drone-Based Assessment of Canopy Cover for Analyzing Tree Mortality in an Oil Palm Agroforest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm monocultures are highly productive, but there are widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Some of these negative impacts might be mitigated by mixed-species tree interplanting to create agroforestry systems, but there is little experience with the performance of trees planted in oil palm plantations. We studied a biodiversity enrichment experiment in the lowlands of Sumatra that was established in a 6- to 12-year-old oil palm plantation by planting six tree species in different mixtures on 48 plots. Three years after tree planting, canopy cover was assessed by drone-based photogrammetry using the structure-from-motion technique. Drone-derived canopy cover estimates were highly correlated with traditional ground-based hemispherical photography along the equality line, indicating the usefulness and comparability of the approach. Canopy cover was further partitioned between oil palm and tree canopies. Thinning of oil palms before tree planting created a more open and heterogeneous canopy cover. Oil palm canopy cover was then extracted at the level of oil palms and individual trees and combined with ground-based mortality assessment for all 3,819 planted trees. For three tree species (Archidendron pauciflorum, Durio zibethinus, and Shorea leprosula), the probability of mortality during the year of the study was dependent on the amount of oil palm canopy cover. We regard the drone-based method for deriving and partitioning spatially explicit information as a promising way for many questions addressing canopy cover in ecological applications and the management of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution of urban heat islands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of an urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most common impacts of the urbanization process. To mitigate the effects of UHI, the planning of urban forests (e.g., creation of parks, forests and afforestation streets) has been the major tool applied in this context. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of heat islands in Vila Velha, ES, Brazil using the mono-window algorithm. The study followed these methodological steps: 1) mapping of urban green areas through a photointerpretation screen; 2) application of the mono-window algorithm to obtain the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST); 3) correlation between LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference build-up index (NDBI); 4) application of ecological evaluation index. The results showed that the mean values of LST in urban areas were at least 2.34 to 7.19 degrees C higher than undeveloped areas. Moreover, the positive correlation between LST and NDBI showed an amplifying effect of the developed areas for UHI, while areas with a predominance of vegetation attenuated the effect of UHI. Urban centers, clustered in some parts of the city, received the worst ecological assessment index. Finally, the adoption of measures to guide the urban forest planning within urban centers is necessary to mitigate the effect of heat islands and provide thermal comfort in urban areas.

TI  - Development of a methodology for selecting criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management: A case study on participatory assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes an application of multiple criteria analysis (MCA) in assessing criteria and indicators adapted for a particular forest management unit. The methods include: ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons. These methods were used in a participatory decision-making environment where a team representing various stakeholders and professionals used their expert opinions and judgements in assessing different criteria and indicators (C&I) on the one hand, and how suitable and applicable they are to a forest management unit on the other. A forest concession located in Kalimantan, Indonesia, was used as the site for the case study. Results from the study show that the multicriteria methods are effective tools that can be used as structured decision aids to evaluate, prioritize, and select sets of C&I for a particular forest management unit. Ranking and rating approaches can be used as a screening tool to develop an initial list of CBI. Pairwise comparison, on the other hand, can be used as a finer filter to further reduce the list. In addition to using these three MCA methods, the study also examines two commonly used group decision-making techniques, the Delphi method and the nominal group technique. Feedback received from the participants indicates that the methods are transparent, easy to implement, and provide a convenient environment for participatory decision-making.

TI  - Forest restoration methods, seasonality, and penetration resistance does not influence aboveground biomass stock on mining tailings in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration methods applied on the areas affected by the Fundao tailings dam collapse have a high priority in Mariana region. We evaluated the effect of different restoration methods and site preparation techniques, depth and seasonality on penetration resistance of tailings, and how these predictors affect tree aboveground biomass in areas affected by the Fundio dam collapse in Mariana, Brazil. No significant differences in penetration resistance and aboveground biomass between treatments were observed, but significant differences were observed between seasonal periods. The main univariate model explained the significant effects of depth and seasonality, mainly by a negatively wet effect on penetration resistance. According to the best models (univariate and multivariate) were those that had depth as a predictor. This study showed how penetration resistance can be an indicator to select the best period for restoration process in areas affected by the collapse of the Fundao dam, but no limit to the aboveground biomass recovery on tailing.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of agricultural and livestock activities on tropical forests often results in long-lasting damage to soil and vegetation. In undisturbed tropical forests, nutrient stocks tend to be larger in the aboveground biomass than in the soil profile; therefore, deforested sites may remain bare for decades due to nutrient limitation. In such circumstance, amelioration of edaphic conditions and planting of tree species adapted to open canopy conditions (pioneers) could help restore ecosystem functions while providing a sustainable source of timber and prompting natural succession. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of biochar as a soil amendment that could accelerate the reforestation of degraded lands. We used a randomized block design with five treatments and four replications, comparing the performance of exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis) and native Tachigali vulgaris trees. We monitored reforested plots for 49 months, evaluating tree survival and growth rates, litter production, canopy cover and density of invasive grasses. The addition of biochar in the soil did not result in significant differences in tree survival or productivity when compared to controls. Comparing the two species, native trees (T. vulgaris) performed better by all metrics, showing 52% survival and producing 241.7 Mg ha(-1) of aboveground biomass after four years of growth. During that same period the survival rate of eucalyptus was 38% and the aboveground productivity was only 82.4 Mg ha(-1). In contrast with eucalyptus plantations, T. vulgaris showed rapid canopy cover and completely suppressed invasive grasses, generating up to 11.7 Mg ha(-1) more litter than eucalyptus trees. Although eucalyptus is one of the most commonly used species in reforestation for timber, charcoal, and pulp and paper production in Brazil, our results demonstrate that T. vulgaris has the potential to replace eucalyptus in commercial plantations with the added benefit of being a native species that can promote the establishment of a stable forest cover in degraded sites.

TI  - ProbFire: a probabilistic fire early warning system for Indonesia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent extreme landscape fire episodes associated with drought events in Indonesia pose severe environmental, societal and economic threats. The ability to predict severe fire episodes months in advance would enable relevant agencies and communities to more effectively initiate fire-preventative measures and mitigate fire impacts. While dynamic seasonal climate predictions are increasingly skilful at predicting fire-favourable conditions months in advance in Indonesia, there is little evidence that such information is widely used yet by decision makers.In this study, we move beyond forecasting fire risk based on drought predictions at seasonal timescales and (i) develop a probabilistic early fire warning system for Indonesia (ProbFire) based on a multilayer perceptron model using ECMWF SEAS5 (fifth-generation seasonal forecasting system) dynamic climate forecasts together with forest cover, peatland extent and active-fire datasets that can be operated on a standard computer; (ii) benchmark the performance of this new system for the 2002-2019 period; and (iii) evaluate the potential economic benefit of such integrated forecasts for Indonesia.ProbFire's event probability predictions outperformed climatology-only based fire predictions at 2- to 4-month lead times in south Kalimantan, south Sumatra and south Papua. In central Sumatra, an improvement was observed only at a 0-month lead time, while in west Kalimantan seasonal predictions did not offer any additional benefit over climatologyonly-based predictions. We (i) find that seasonal climate forecasts coupled with the fire probability prediction model confer substantial benefits to a wide range of stakeholders involved in fire management in Indonesia and (ii) provide a blueprint for future operational fire warning systems that integrate climate predictions with non-climate features.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Selective Logging on the Forest Understory in the Amazon Using Airborne LiDAR
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management (SFM) areas. However, monitoring the forest understory-a critical area for assessing logging impacts-remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rond & ocirc;nia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts.

TI  - Variability and genetic structure in fragments of Eugenia involucrata De Candolle established through microsatellite markers
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Eugenia involucrata DC. is a forest species with high environmental and economic potential. The objective of this study was to quantify the genetic variability and analyzed the genetic structure of three natural fragments located in the central region of the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We used four microsatellite loci developed for the congener species Eugenia uniflora and using GenAlEx 6.5 software, parameters of genetic variability and its partition among and within fragments were estimated for each locus. We observed high levels of genetic variability (3.67 alleles per locus; H-O = 0.815; H-E = 0.625; F-IS = -0.294), most of which (93%) were distributed within the fragments, suggesting that these individuals came from a single original population. Gene flow between fragments was high (2.35 to 4.56 migrants per generation), resulting in low genetic differentiation indexes (F-ST values ranging from 0.052 to 0.096). The fragments showed high genetic variability, distributed within the remnants themselves, and low genetic differentiation. Our results have repercussions for planning locally adapted germplasm collections for forest restoration programs, thereby avoiding the implantation of populations with an exogamous depression.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of protected area management in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

TI  - Brazilian State Forest Institutions: Implementation of forestry goals evaluated by the 3L Model
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of Brazilian territory (54%), or approx. 463 million ha, is covered by forests. Public forest ownership dominates with up to 80%, private forests cover cca. 20% and cca. 8% is unclaimed. In public forests the practice of concessions is growing, with the expectation of reducing the problem of Amazonian illegal loggings. Private forests are mainly under plantation management, which generates 5.5% of the country's industrial gross domestic product. Relevance of both is accordingly high, although not dominant in forest share. A key question for forest policy is how successfully the state regulates both issues in practice. Our paper accordingly focuses on the Brazilian Forest Service and the Ministry of Agriculture, which are state forest institutions in charge of forest concessions and planted forests. We look at their performance against legally based forestry goals and rely on primary (participatory observation, semi-structured personal interviews and questionnaire) and secondary sources (documents) for empirical evidence. The 3 L Model serves as a theoretical basis. It was selected while applying criteria and indicators for evaluation of public institutions' comprehensive performance with respect to sustainable forest management. The results show that Brazilian forest policy strives toward sustainable forest management, as an overall goal. In more particular, the performance of both examined state forest institutions is more market (than public demand) oriented and moves towards strengthening market competences. At the same time, there are constrains in sustaining forest stands. Due to permanent and strong conflicts related to land use changes in Brazil, the relevance of a mediator, aiming to harmonize all different interests related to forest protection and use, is high, but this role is still not taken, at least not by the evaluated state forest institutions. This represents new task for the forestry practice, while facilitating diverse interests in Brazilian forests could not only be a contribution toward conflict management between environmental, forestry and agribusiness actors but could also grant stronger political role to respective state forest institution(s). For attending this role, the performance evaluation of the whole and rather complex forest-related institutional setting in Brazil could provide relevant science-based policy arguments. This paper shows that the 3 L Model could be applied for such evaluation, as it was possible to adapt it to a non-European country and get a comprehensive overview of Brazilian plantation and concession forestry in practice.

AB  - Drought is the main natural disasters in Indonesia. Study of spatial and temporal drought pattern distribution is great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation. Agricultural drought assessment was used to monitor agricultural sustainability, particularly in East Java as the national centre for agricultural production in Indonesia This study aimed to detect the spatial and temporal pattern of agricultural drought using Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and illustrated drought characteristics in East Java, Indonesia during 2017-2018. In this research, we use LST and EVI data from MODIS Terra satellite data. We used LST for calculating TCI, and EVI for calculating VCI. VHI were obtained by TCI and VCI score. The result showed that all drought-affected areas were experienced by moderate droughts. Bojonegoro, Magetan and Gresik district has the highest drought level compared to another district in East Java. Drought area increased significantly in September to October, which is dry season in Indonesia and cover 69.13% of agricultural area.

T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Edaphic macrofauna must be better studied if we want to take advantage of their full potential for the restoration of tropical ecosystems. We investigated changes in edaphic macrofauna density and diversity along a secondary succession chronosequence in the Atlantic Forest. Our results show some clear patterns of change in soil macrofauna along the chronosequence. Density did not increase along secondary succession, but was correlated with canopy cover. Diversity was characterized by high dominance of social insects and evenness among other groups. We conclude soil macrofauna has a high capacity to recolonize young forests and that its recovery is considerably fast compared to other ecosystem transformations.

TI  - Land Recovery and Soil Management with Agroforestry Systems
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Soils have many ecological functions and provide various ecosystem services including support for global food and fuel production. However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet's arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

TI  - Use of artificial perches for wild birds in a degraded area in southern Brazil
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - . One of the major setbacks in environmental restoration is how to promote the arrival of propagules in degraded areas, and this issue is intensified at sites without vegetation, where natural dispersal is limited. To overcome this issue, one of the methods employed is the use of artificial perches, intended for attracting seeddispersing birds, providing perching sites, and thus, facilitating the formation of vegetation nuclei from the seeds that are excreted, regurgitated, or accidentally dropped. The aim of this study was to quantify and identify the birds that used the artificial perches in a degraded area on the margins of the Forqueta River, RS, Brazil, in order to evaluate their effectiveness as an ecological restoration method. Over one year, 11 bird species were observed to use the perches. Despite the presence of birds, there was no significant seed germination at the base of the perches. Absence of frugivorous species and adverse conditions of the soil might have contributed to this result. Previous studies showed diverging results on the effectiveness of artificial perches, indicating the need for considering several factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of invasive species. The present study highlights the complexity of ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded areas and the importance of adaptive approaches to reach effective results.

TI  - Wealth and the distribution of benefits from tropical forests: Implications for REDD
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interventions to strengthen forest conservation in tropical biomes face multiple challenges. Insecure land tenure and unequal benefit sharing within forest user groups are two of the most important. Using original household level survey data from 130 villages in six countries, we assess how current wealth inequality relates to tenure security and benefit flows from forest use. We find that villages with higher wealth inequality report lower tenure security and more unequal flows from forest income and externally sourced income. Furthermore, we find that wealthier individuals within villages capture a disproportionately larger share of the total amount of forest benefits available to each village, while external income often benefits poorer individuals more. These findings suggest that unless future forest conservation interventions actively work to mitigate inequalities linked to existing forest benefit flows, there is a risk that these interventions-including those associated with REDD + activities reproduce or even aggravate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities within user groups, potentially undermining both their conservation and economic objectives.

AB  - The hooded capuchin (Sapajus cay) is an adaptable, generalist primate species found throughout eastern Paraguay with preferences for the Paraguayan Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA). BAAPA is one of the world's most critically endangered terrestrial habitats with more than 90% of its original cover lost to industrial agriculture. Given its charismatic characteristics, the capuchin species is a candidate flagship species for this ecoregion; however, its habitat preferences in BAAPA degraded fragments are unknown. We develop a species distribution model using MAXENT to determine the remotely sensed microhabitat features associated with habitat suitability in forests that had experienced different levels of degradation. The model was fitted to presence-only observations at two sites, Rancho Laguna Blanca and Nueva Gambach, to determine how hooded capuchin distribution is associated with remotely sensed habitat features in BAAPA fragments. Wetness (mean and standard deviation), a measure of soil moisture and canopy closure, was found to be the most important driver at both sites. The capuchins showed a preference for more mature forest, bamboo dominated forest and flooded forest (that has experienced little selective logging in the past). The capuchin was a forest obligate species and avoided crop fields. The monkeys were less likely to be found in degraded areas, even though they were still forested. As Paraguayan deforestation involves the creation of large crop fields separating BAAPA fragments, the probability that the hooded capuchin can move between those fragments is low. The hooded capuchin is a candidate flagship species for an agroforestry reforestation programme to reconnect BAAPA fragments. We propose that combining native tree corridors with shade grown yerba mate and slash pine plantations would create habitat for the capuchin and other wildlife while helping to alleviate poverty in the area and the pressure that this causes on the forests' natural resources.

TI  - Characterizing aboveground biomass and tree cover of regrowing forests in Brazil using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Characterization of regrowing forests is vital for understanding forest dynamics to assess the impacts on carbon stocks and to support sustainable forest management. Although remote sensing is a key tool for understanding and monitoring forest dynamics, the use of exclusively remotely sensed data to explore the effects of different variables on regrowing forests across all biomes in Brazil has rarely been investigated. Here, we analyzed how environmental and human factors affect regrowing forests. Based on Brazil's secondary forest age map, 3060 locations disturbed between 1984 and 2018 were sampled, interpreted and analyzed in different biomes. We interpreted the time since disturbance for the sampled pixels in Google Earth Engine. Elevation, slope, climatic water deficit (CWD), the total Nitrogen of soil, cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements and fire frequency were analyzed in their importance for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree cover derived from global forest aboveground biomass map and tree cover map, respectively. Results show that time since disturbance interpreted from satellite time series is the most important predictor for characterizing AGB and tree cover of regrowing forests. AGB increased with increasing time since disturbance, surrounding tree cover, soil total N, slope, distance to roads, distance to settlements and decreased with larger fire frequency, CWD and CEC of soil. Tree cover increased with larger time since disturbance, soil total N, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements, slope and decreased with increasing elevation and CWD. These results emphasize the importance of remotely sensing products as key opportunities to improve the characterization of forest regrowth and to reduce data gaps and uncertainties related to forest carbon sink estimation. Our results provide a better understanding of regional forest dynamics, toward developing and assessing effective forest-related restoration and climatic mitigation strategies.

TI  - Land use footprints and policies in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological footprints have been assessed widely from a resource production-consumption perspective but much less from a land use per capita availability-demand standpoint. The later view is key to land use policy because it sheds light on the need of changing or adapting uses to get a balance between those of ecological (e.g., forests, riparian wetlands) and those of socioeconomic (e.g., cropland) value. Thus, the purpose of this study was to introduce the LUEF - Land Use Ecological Footprint, defined as the area of a specific use or occupation in a region over the population of that region in a pre-defined timeframe. The index was then applied to the Brazilian territory at the macro region resolution, and to the 2015 - 2019 period. The results identified deforestation, urban densification, cropland/pasture expansion and riparian forest restoration as main drivers of LUEF change in the studied period, as well as supporters of concomitant gross domestic product. The results also revealed negative consequences of LUEF changes for water security and organic carbon stocks in the top layer of soils (decline). Some regional metrics were proposed to revert these consequences, namely the control of urban LUEF above 100 m2/hab to keep water security at the National average level, and of cropland LUEF below 900 m2/hab to preserve organic carbon stock in the macro regions' topsoils close to the National average (46.9 Mg/ha), reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sequel. The leveling of those LUEFs at the aforementioned values requires intensification of ongoing policy initiatives relevant to mitigate the land use ecological footprints. The study identified various examples, which included the Brazilian Forest Code, the National policies on urban and family agriculture, Payment for Ecosystem Services programs, among others. Overall, the study recognized Brazil as being in the right track to pursue sustainable land use.

TI  - The impact of green house gas mitigation policy for land use and the forestry sector in Indonesia: Applying the computable general equilibrium model
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's economy relies heavily on the land-based sector, which results in high deforestation and forest degradation that leads to large emissions from Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF). Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, Indonesia has committed to achieving emission reductions of 29% by 2030 as compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. However, as the largest share comes from LUCF, mitigation efforts in this sector will reduce its production. This study assesses the potential impact of the implementation of the mitigation efforts in the LUCF sector on the economy and environment through the use of a computable general equilibrium model. Two main approaches were introduced to reduce emissions: 1) increasing the crop yield (intensification), which is expected to motivate farmers to use less land and thus, lead to a decrease in deforestation; and 2) encouraging land conservation. Our simulation indicated that intensification alone results in less GDP loss but does not significantly reduce deforestation and emissions from LUCF as farmers will still cultivate the land as usual, and land expansion for commercial plantations, especially palm oil, will continue. Therefore, introducing conservation practices, though costly, may help to protect forest areas and reduce emissions from LUCF. Thus, the simultaneous implementation of intensification and conservation efforts is recommended. To this end, cooperation between the central and regional governments is necessary along with an incentive scheme that encourages farmers to adopt mitigation efforts on their lands.

TI  - Typology, management and smallholder farmer-preferred traits for selection of indigenous goats (Capra hisrcus) in three agro-ecological zones in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the typology, production management, and smallholder farmer-preferred traits in selecting indigenous goats in three agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Based on a structured survey, baseline data were recorded on 320 adults and unrelated does from 202 goat farms. Hierarchical clustering on principal components revealed three clusters in the goats studied well distinguished by double and triple kidding. Prolific goats mostly clustered into cluster two and three more represented by goats of South Kivu while 82.69% of goats in Tshopo were clustered into cluster one characterized by low reproductive performances. The Canonical Discriminant Analysis revealed that the body length was an important variable both to discriminate and to classify goats from the three AEZs. Goats from Kinshasa and South Kivu were not distanced while large distance was observed between goats from Kinshasa and Tshopo (F-stat, p < 0.001). While not subjected to any good management practices, goats were considered as a source of income and saving method in smallholder farmers' households. Adaptability, resistance to disease and prolificacy were preferred traits by farmers in selecting goats. These results give the first step in the decision-making towards goat improvement in DR Congo.

TI  - Germination, viability and dormancy of 47 species from threatened tropical montane grassland in southeast Brazil: Implications for ex situ conservation
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate anthropogenic impacts on plant diversity in tropical montane grasslands, one of the most threatened ecosystems in Brazil, it will be essential to develop ex situ conservation strategies to preserve wild species. The lack of basic research on the seed storage behaviour of grassland species may, however, limit their use for reintroduction and restoration projects.We investigated seed storage behaviour at the community level by comparing the effects of cold-low RH (10 degrees C; 10% RH) and freezing-low RH (20 degrees C; 10% RH) conditions on seed viability, germination and dormancy of 47 species.Fresh seeds of 43% of the species showed primary dormancy. More than half of the species showed high seed survival responses (viability >60%) under both storage temperatures. Despite a variety of dormancy responses among the different species, the low RH storage conditions tested released dormancy for most species during 12- and 30-month storage times. Multivariate analysis of the best (freezing-low RH, 30 months) storage condition evidenced the formation of five distinct groups, three with species having high conservation potential in seed banks.Although further studies are needed to test dormancy-breaking treatments and improve seed conservation practices, this first approach to assessing seed banking techniques could contribute to demand for locally adapted seeds for ecological restoration projects in tropical montane grasslands.

TI  - Costs of certified emission reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the cost structure of certified emission reductions (CERs) through various types of projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. Using the CDM project data, the costs of CERs and their variation across technology and over time and space are estimated by applying alternative functional forms and specifications. Results show that the average cost of CERs decreases with the project scale and duration, scale and duration effects significantly vary across project types, and there is an upward trend in costs. The results also show that the distribution of the projects in the CDM portfolio or a given location does not strictly follow the relative cost structure, nor does the distribution of the CDM projects in different host countries follow the principle of comparative advantage. More than 84% of the CDM portfolio consists of various energy projects with substantially higher costs of CERs than afforestation and reforestation, industrial and landfill gas reduction, and methane avoidance projects, which are only 12% of all projects. While per unit cost of abatement plays an important role in the bottom-up and top-down models to evaluate emission reduction potential and analyze policy alternatives, the findings contradict the presumption of such models that project investors seek out low-cost opportunities. At the aggregate level, the cost of CER by the projects in Asia and Europe is similar but higher than those hosted in Africa, Americas, and Oceania. Yet more than 83% of the projects in the CDM portfolio are located in Asia; more than 69% of the projects are in China and India alone. China appears to have a comparative advantage (i.e., lowest opportunity cost) in energy efficiency projects, while India has a comparative advantage in hydro power projects and Brazil has a comparative advantage in wind power projects. In contrast, energy efficiency category accounts for only 8% of the CDM projects in China, hydro power accounts for 12% of the projects in India, and wind power accounts for 18% of the projects in Brazil. The results provide a basis for evaluating the incentives that the mechanism offers as a cost effective policy instrument that balances greenhouse gas mitigation across sectors and regions, while fulfilling the objective of the convention.

TI  - Conservation agriculture assists smallholder farmers and their agroecosystem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture, a sustainable farming practice combining no or minimum soil disturbance, crop diversification, and soil cover, can benefit humans and the biophysical environment. However, less than half of Sub-Saharan African countries implement conservation agriculture, and the majority of smallholder farmers are using unsustainable practices. Research and field trials on conservation agriculture adaptation to soil and ag-roecological conditions are vital for increasing adoption of conservation agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the change in soil chemical properties and soil biology from implementation of conservation agriculture, (ii) assess cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) yield and variability under conservation agriculture compared to the conventional farming practice, and (iii) evaluate differences in soil chemical properties, soil biology, and crop yields under conservation agriculture in savannah and forest ecosystems compared to conventional agriculture in smallholder farming in the province of Maniema in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Soils under conservation agriculture had 6.5 times more (p < 0.001) earthworms, 23% and 10% greater (p < 0.05) concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium, respectively, and 100% greater (p < 0.001) cowpea yield than soils under conventional agriculture. Measured across all sites, conservation agriculture and conventional cowpea yields had coefficients of variation of 25% and 16%, respectively. This study showed for the first time that conservation agriculture implementation contributes to soil health and food security associated with smallholder farming in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

CL  - Chiang Mai, THAILAND
AB  - In Indonesia, most of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) cultivars with orange-colour rind are grown on the high land areas of 700-1200 m above sea level. Growing trees under this altitude induces the fruit rind color to change to greenish yellow with more pale flesh. Evaluation of five selected trees had been conducted in order to choose the best one based on the horticultural performance. The selected mother tree were free from the Huang Long Bin pathogen, Citrus tristeza virus, and other viruses by shoot tip grafting, followed by indexing. Now, three years after the viruses, tree planting materials were produced. More than 200,000 trees or 400 ha have been planted by citrus growers in the regency of Nunukan, Berau and Kutai Timur in East Kalimantan, Borneo where this mandarin cultivar was found. 'Borneo Prima', the promising mandarin cultivar will become a mascot of East Kalimantan. It has round-shaped fruit, yellow to orange colour rind, easy peeling and good balance between sweet and sour taste. It is well adapted to low and wet areas. The crop requirement, agro-ecological zones and its relation with other cultivars of mandarin by DNA-test, are discussed in more detail in this paper.

TI  - Forest certification and legality initiatives in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessons for effective and equitable forest governance
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper draws on a case study of the Brazilian Amazon to assess how two widely promoted strategies to govern tropical forests non-state certification and state-based legality initiatives interact with tropical wood production systems and the implications this holds for reducing deforestation and degradation and for local benefit-sharing. The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance.We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems.

TI  - Future environmental and agricultural impacts of Brazil's Forest Code
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of improving the enforcement of Brazil's Forest Code in reducing deforestation in the Amazon has been highlighted in many studies. However, in a context of strong political pressure for loosening environmental protections, the future impacts of a nationwide implementation of the Forest Code on both environment and agriculture remain poorly understood. Here, we present a spatially explicit assessment of Brazil's 2012 Forest Code through the year 2050; specifically, we use a partial equilibrium economic model that provides a globally consistent national modeling framework with detailed representation of the agricultural sector and spatially explicit land-use change. We test for the combined or isolated impacts of the different measures of the Forest Code, including deforestation control and obligatory forest restoration with or without environmental reserve quotas. Our results show that, if rigorously enforced, the Forest Code could prevent a net loss of 53.4 million hectares (Mha) of forest and native vegetation by 2050, 43.1 Mha (81%) of which are in the Amazon alone. The control of illegal deforestation promotes the largest environmental benefits, but the obligatory restoration of illegally deforested areas creates 12.9Mha of new forested area. Environmental reserve quotas further protect 5.8Mha of undisturbed natural vegetation. Compared to a scenario without the Forest Code, by 2050, cropland area is only reduced by 4% and the cattle herd by 8%. Our results show that compliance with the Forest Code requires an increase in cattle productivity of 56% over four decades, with a combination of a higher use of supplements and an adoption of semi-intensive pasture management. We estimate that the enforcement of the Forest Code could contribute up to 1.03 PgCO(2)e to the ambitious GHG emissions reduction target set by Brazil for 2030.

TI  - Assessment of Water Ecosystem Integrity (WEI) in a Transitional Brazilian Cerrado-Atlantic Forest Interface
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Although healthy ecosystems are vital to sustaining human society, the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes have suffered from disorderly human development and the intense use of natural resources. Thus, cost-effective studies are needed to develop tools to assess environmental conservation and the integrity of water courses to inform decisions for ensuring their recovery where ecosystem maintenance is deficient. This study sought to develop a methodology in which the Watershed Habitat Evaluation and Biotic Integrity Protocol (WHEBIP) and Rapid Assessment Protocol for Habitat Diversity (RAP) could be used in an integrated, adaptive manner to evaluate the Water Ecosystem Integrity (WEI) in courses of rivers and streams in tropical regions of the Brazilian Cerrado-Atlantic Forest interface undergoing intense agricultural exploitation. Accordingly, a spatial assessment using geographic information systems was followed by a field visit to apply the methodology. A preliminary assessment of the soil conditions in the Lobo Reservoir Hydrographic Basin was conducted, identifying stretches of rivers and streams that were suitable for payment for environmental services and for recovery from the impact of anthropic activities. Such activities were present in 50.23% of the basin's total area, and intensive degradation was found in stretches of the water courses, primarily where the head springs of the Itaqueri River and Lobo Stream, the principal tributaries of the Lobo Reservoir, lie. Native vegetation, Brazilian Cerrado, and reforestation occupy a total of 38.5% of the basin, comprising areas of intense conservation activity by the Brazilian government.

TI  - Can mulch be effective in controlling exotic grasses and promoting natural regeneration in ecological restoration?
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Mulching use in agriculture has been known since 1802 as the practice of spreading dry leaves and straw on the soil to prevent erosion and water loss. Our study evaluated the mulch effectiveness in the establishment of regenerating seedlings and its contribution to the control of exotic grasses. The studies were carried out in an ecological restoration area in the municipality of Itapira-SP. The treatment with mulching consisted in chemical desiccation with glyphosate herbicide application, keeping the dry grass on the ground. In the control treatment, after chemical weeding, the grass was removed with manual mowing, exposing the soil. Eight months after implantation, we sampled all regenerating seedlings in 100 plots of 50 x 50 cm in each treatment. We considered as seedlings all individuals of tree species less than 100 cm tall. We calculated richness, abundance, similarity, and the relationship of the frequency of seedlings to the height of the mulch. We sampled eight species with 42 seedlings, with only one not identified. The highest abundance and species richness were found in the treatment with mulch (n = 34 individuals; eight species), the most abundant being Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (14 individuals) followed by Solanum mauritianum Scop. (11 individuals), and Platypodium elegans Vog. (three individuals). The presence of exotic grasses was lower in the plots of the mulching (13%) compared to the control treatment (67%). The highest frequency of seedlings was obtained with mulch height from 21 to 37 cm. We suggest that adaptive management practices, such as the use of the mulching technique, can be implemented in ecological restoration areas, because they favor the natural regeneration of native seedlings and can contribute to the control of exotic grasses, but the height of the layer must be controlled.

TI  - Use of n-alkanes to trace erosion and main sources of sediments in a watershed in southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosive processes can transport sediments containing nutrients, heavy metals and contaminants of organic and inorganic origin into bodies of water, therefore affecting the local ecosystem and the population that benefits from the water sources. In order to better understand the origin of sediment sources and establish mitigation measures, the use of the sediment fingerprinting technique has been highlighted. Thus, the present work had as objective to apply n-alkanes in order to trace and understand the main sources of organic matter in sediments and associate the results with land and soil occupation. The study area is located in the municipality of Rio Negrinho - Brazil, in the Sad river basin. Soil samples were collected and classified according to their use and occupation, as well as and samples of local vegetation to be used as reference. The distribution of n-alkanes in the sediments was compared with the distribution found in the vegetation and soil. Previously, a distribution pattern of n-alkanes had been identified in all major vegetation used to trace the source of organic matter and hence the soil. The concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and granulometry were also analyzed in the soil and sediment samples. Indexes between n-alkanes were used and applied to assess the source together with statistical analysis (PCA). In sum, the results showed that the sediments are mainly composed of Pious taeda reforestation soils, as well as soil from the abandoned roads used to transport the cut trees, while the contribution of autochthonous sediments was found to be minimal. In this way, the fingerprint technique served as an auxiliary tool in order to establish measures for the good management of a river basin, bringing important information about the contributing sources of sediment to water bodies.

T2  - ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE HORTICULTURA ORNAMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban afforestation produces a great enhancement in the flora of cities, but if improperly implanted they generate disturbances, especially if the implanted species are not adapted to electric energy networks The objective of this paper was to carry out a qualitative-quantitative survey on urban afforestation through the interconnection with the electricity network in the five cities with most issues of electricity shutdown caused by trees in the South of Minas Gerais state At the end of the inventory there were 221 individuals belonging to 58 species, 56% of which were exotic and 44% native. Eight species counted for 51.99% of the total inventory, being: Jacaranda mimosifolia, Platanus acerifolia, Murraya paniculata, Lagerstroemia indica, Schinus molle, Ficus benjamina, Bauhinia variegata and Poincianella pluviosa. Only the species Schinus molle and Poincianella pluviosa are native. More than half of the inventoried trees presented a size incompatible with the electrical network, species of large (55.59%), medium (24.42%) and small (19.99%) sizes, to be implanted for urban afforestation. The selected streets had narrow widths, but the sidewalks had ideal widths for the implantation of afforestation. Treetop pruning was performed in 20% of the individuals evaluated, a practice that is widely used due to the presence of large species. The species evaluated in the inventory showed height ranging from 2 to 6 meters, not reaching their maximum potential when belonging to medium and large species. For the studied cities it is recommended a new evaluation of the urban afforestation, seeking to identify the appropriate patterns to the urban environment.

TI  - Influence of Removal of a Non-native Tree Species Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. on the Regenerating Plant Communities in a Tropical Semideciduous Forest Under Restoration in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits. In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation systems (modified "taungya" agroforestry system; and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species) established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in So Paulo state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height a parts per thousand yen0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M. caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area. Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings.

TI  - Enhancing ecological connectivity through biodiversity offsets to mitigate impacts on habitats of large mammals in tropical forest environments
T2  - IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are ecological impacts of development projects known to have severe effects on mammals' populations. Here, we study the role of connectivity assessment in Environmental Impact Assessment, focusing on its contribution to determining appropriate mitigation, in particular, biodiversity offsetting. For that purpose, we analysed the dispersal of large mammals in a region potentially influenced by a mine located in the Atlantic rainforest in Brazil and anticipate the long-term outcomes of restoration offsets by modelling a 30-year post-offset scenario. Results show that: (i) offsets enhance ecological connectivity and are used as an alternative habitat for the animals dispersed due to habitat loss and fragmentation; (ii) the location of restoration areas should be carefully planned to maximize their contribution to increase ecological connectivity and enhance habitat quality. The reviewed case suggests that best practices to incorporate connectivity analysis in environmental impact assessment include: (i) monitoring biodiversity to quantify losses and gains; (ii) modelling offset areas alternatives for both protection and restoration; and (iii) conducting rigorous analysis of project alternatives, aiming at impact avoidance.

TI  - Payments for ecosystem services in Amazonia. The challenge of land use heterogeneity in agricultural frontiers near Cruzeiro do Sul (Acre, Brazil)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. By promoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight of their socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting.

TI  - Why is Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. a common species in the mining tailings of the Fundao dam in Minas Gerais, Brazil?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, more than five years after the Fundao dam failure in Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. is the main grass in pasturelands affected by the mining tailings. The aim of this study was to investigate the reason for this fact as well as to determine the ecophysiological effects of mining tailings on B. decumbens and to test whether mixing the tailings with unaffected local soil enhances the affected soil properties. For the experiment, two different soils were collected, one unaffected soil without mining tailings (Ref) and the mining tailings (Tec), and we also created a mixture with 50 % of each soil type (Ref/Tec). We cultivated B. decumbens in the three soil treatments in a greenhouse for 110 days and evaluated soil physical-chemical properties and plant ecophysiology. Our results show that the tailings (Tec) compromised the normal ecophysiological state of B. decumbens. The species survived these adverse conditions due to its great efficiency in acquiring some elements. The soil management tested by this work mitigated the stress caused by tailings and can represent an alternative for the environmental recovery of the affected soils.

TI  - Lessons on direct seeding to restore Neotropical savanna
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical grassland-savanna mosaics are threatened globally, but they are challenging to restore because highly competitive pasture grasses inhibit recovery and are not shaded out by the patchy tree cover. We analyzed the outcomes of restoration projects and experiments established over four years in 55 ha of abandoned pastures dominated by invasive C4 grasses within the Neotropical savanna, Central Brazil. We tested the efficacy of direct seeding native grasses, forbs, shrubs and trees in reducing invasive grass cover and increasing native ground cover. We performed a series of experiments aimed at answering questions about the effect of seeding density, soil plowing to control invasive grasses, life form of ground cover species (grass, forb or shrub) and soil type on restoration outcomes. Relative native cover reached 34 +/- 3% three rainy seasons after the first seeding experiment. Higher seeding densities and more soil plowing repetitions increased relative native cover. Soil type interacted with the life form of ground cover species to strongly influence relative native cover; two years after seeding, the highest relative native cover was achieved in rocky soils seeded with grasses (78 +/- 6%) and the lowest was for seasonally waterlogged soils seeded with shrubs (15 +/- 4%). Direct seeding can effectively establish many native Neotropical savanna species of different life forms with better restoration outcomes on rocky soils and with higher seeding densities. Further research is urgent to improve restoration methods, especially to control invasive grasses, to be able to achieve the large-scale restoration targets set internationally.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium of the NAtive Seed Science, TEchnology and Conservation (NAS-STEC)
CL  - Royal Botan Gardens, Kew, ENGLAND
AB  - Large-scale restoration programmes in the tropics require large volumes of high quality, genetically diverse and locally adapted seeds from a large number of species. However, scarcity of native seeds is a critical restriction to achieve restoration targets. In this paper, we analyse three successful community-based networks that supply native seeds and seedlings for Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado restoration projects. In addition, we propose directions to promote local participation, legal, technical and commercialisation issues for up-scaling the market of native seeds for restoration with high quality and social justice. We argue that effective community-based restoration arrangements should follow some principles: (i) seed production must be based on real market demand; (ii) non-governmental and governmental organisations have a key role in supporting local organisation, legal requirements and selling processes; (iii) local ecological knowledge and labour should be valued, enabling local communities to promote large-scale seed production; (iv) applied research can help develop appropriate techniques and solve technical issues. The case studies from Brazil and principles presented here can be useful for the up-scaling restoration ecology efforts in many other parts of the world and especially in tropical countries where improving rural community income is a strategy for biodiversity conservation and restoration.

TI  - Pollen contamination and nonrandom mating in a Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh seedling seed orchard
T2  - SILVAE GENETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus camaldulensis has potential for timber, energy, pulp and cellulose production in Brazil due to its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. The use of improved seeds, selected for economic growth traits, is necessary to increase productivity of commercial stands. Seed seedlings orchards (SSO) are one option for improved seed production. However, pollen contamination from unimproved populations, as well as non-random mating in the SSO, can decrease the predicted genetic gains in selected populations. Thus, we investigate the mating system, pollen flow and dispersal patterns in an E. camaldulensis SSO and progeny test (PT), established with seedlings collected in the SSO, using seven microsatellite loci. All trees in the SSO were mapped, sampled, and genotyped. For the PT, we sampled, genotyped, and measured the total height of seedlings from 25 families. We detected 10 % inbreeding in the PT, resulting mainly from selfing. Furthermore, we found a correlated mating rate of 18.5 % in the SSO, indicating that within the PT there are some full-sibs. Using paternity analysis, we found 14.7 % pollen contamination and a pattern of pollen dispersal between near neighbor trees in the SSO. We found 9.5 % of inbreeding depression for seedlings height. Due to pollen contamination and non-random mating in the SSO, the actual genetic gains for growth traits in the PT are probably lower than the predicted genetic gains. We discuss some management strategies in the SSO that can be used to increase genetic gains in commercial reforestation established using seeds collected from the SSO.

TI  - Sustainable Palm Oil: Dissecting a Global Debate
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE PLANTATION (1ST ICSP 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Plantation (ICSP) - Better Environment with Better Prosperity, Harmonization of Humankind and Nature
CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Palm oil expansion in tropical forest margins captures headlines, primarily out of concern that encroachment to tropical forest causes environmental problem and ignites social issues [1]. Sustainability has to be understood in the wider context of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), rather than as primarily a plot-level ecological concern about persistence of production, to make sense of the debate that has become a very polarized and find ways forward. Cascading ecological and social issues have caused a loss of trust, (threats of) consumer boycotts and multiple standards and certification responses. Diverse sustainability issues have come up as part of a public issue-attention cycle with five recognisable stages [2]: A) Agenda setting, B) Better and widely shared understanding of what is at stake, C) Commitment to common principles, D) Details of devils derailing operations, devolved to (newly created or existing) formal institutions that handle implementation and associated budgets, and E) Efforts to monitor and evaluate effects. In Indonesia two phases of new establishment of palm oil coexist within a forest transition gradient: (i) (industry-led) expansion into new forest margins with many social and ecological consequences; and (ii) (often farmerled) conversion of existing agroforestry and tree crop (often rubber-based) or pasture economies in mosaic landscapes. External consumer concerns refer to the expansion phase, rather than to production sustainability or issues of smallholder concern. However, certification standards are only partially adjusted to the latter. After a 'voluntary industry standards' phase of differentiation with and shifting blame to non-certified others [3], government involvement in Malaysia and Indonesia suggests that standards and certification can trickle down to enforceable good practice standards for all. This can learn from past ineffective policies that did not address the real issues in local context [4]. On the other hand, subnational jurisdictional entities are the scale at which oil palm production can be balanced with other goals, such as forest conservation and smallholder welfare. This needs a supportive and clear national policy support that combines clarity on forest protection (as in the now permanent moratorium), with support for risk-reducing diversified smallholder oil palm production systems [5,6] and international communication that acknowledges past problems but shows Indonesia is ready to move on, connecting all the dots of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Direct seeding of native fruit tree species with economic benefits in a Brazilian Cerrado managed landscape
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting native species of economic interest is attractive to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation because of their potential to generate income, products and services, combining socioeconomic and environmental demands. Direct seeding is a low-cost restoration technique compared to nursery-raised seedling planting, but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in Brazil. We tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the Brazilian Cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. We monitored germination, survival, growth and establishment for three years. Of the 9000 seeds planted, 18.7% germinated, 29.8% survived and 8.9% were established three years after sowing. Eugenia dysenterica (Mart.) DC. and Dypterix alata Vogel had higher germination, survival and establishment rates and are, thus, the most appropriate species. E. dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed Cerrado and D. alata in agroforestry system, hillside fields and lower field. The species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility. However, phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth. Our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the Cerrado is promising to some species, and to others, the sowing should be done with more seeds, or using nursery-raised seedling. The planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods.

TI  - Enhancing Fire Monitoring Method over Peatlands and Non-Peatlands in Indonesia Using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia needs a daily monitoring system due to its frequent fires and, more importantly, to assist stakeholders in the field in taking action to mitigate disasters. Our method simplified the number of hotspots for field-based purposes and was verified by comparing the point-based (point-HS) VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) 375m-derived temperature anomalies (hotspots) and clustered-based hotspots (cluster-HS, our suggested method). Using Euclidean clustering, we calculated the distance between hotspot points and applied specific criteria to reduce the number of hotspots while aligning them closely with fire incidents. We evaluated accuracy at different fire sizes, burned areas, peatlands, and distances from the reported burn center. We found that the accuracy increases at 1.5 km from the center of the fire for both point- and cluster-HS at 52% and 53%, respectively. For areas larger than 14 ha, both types of hotspots yielded superior results of 83%. Cluster-HS performs better on peatlands than non-peatlands (62% vs. 57%). Without diminishing the precision of the hotspot observation, this study indicates that our method is reliable for assisting field stakeholders in the field in taking actions. Therefore, this product could be implemented into Indonesia's daily hotspot monitoring.

TI  - Local institutions: Regulation and valuation of forest use-Evidence from Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management poses particular challenges as the pressure on forests is huge due to deforestation. In this context, the establishment of protected areas is a common conservation measure where institutions are put in place and sanctions regarding forest use are enforced. This paper focuses on the practice of sustainable forest management and the associated perspectives of local institutions at the rainforest margins of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.Our case study applies a qualitative social science research approach. Interviews and group discussions with relevant actors such as farmers, village authorities, the National Park authority, and non-governmental organization members were conducted. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework served to structure the study and to provide a set of questions to be considered concerning rules, participants, and conservation outcomes. State-induced formal rules are compared with traditional informal rules regarding natural resource use. Our results suggest that the current state-imposed formal rules have not been successfully implemented in the past. Insufficient boundary demarcation, and a lack of congruence between rules and local conditions have been identified as main reasons. Traditional informal rules are rather more respected by local people since they are adapted to traditional use rights and sanctions at the village level. Community conservation agreements (CCAs) are considered a promising tool to mediate between National Park conservation interests and local people's needs integrating traditional informal rules. However, the CCAs implemented in the LLNP area do not address existing differences in perception and behavior of indigenous people and migrants in the area. We argue that this is a central aspect in terms of successful CCA implementation and forest management. Thus, we recommend that the National Park authority should take the cultural diversity of the area seriously into consideration and integrate flexible and distinct socio-cultural strategies into its management processes.

AB  - The restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of forests by 2030 are amongst the leading mitigation strategies for reducing carbon emissions within the Brazilian Nationally Determined Contribution targets assumed under the Paris Agreement. Understanding the dynamics of forest cover, which steeply decreased between 1985 and 2018 throughout Brazil, is essential for estimating the global carbon balance and quantifying the provision of ecosystem services. To know the long-term increment, extent, and age of secondary forests is crucial; however, these variables are yet poorly quantified. Here we developed a 30-m spatial resolution dataset of the annual increment, extent, and age of secondary forests for Brazil over the 1986-2018 period. Land-use and land-cover maps from MapBiomas Project (Collection 4.1) were used as input data for our algorithm, implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset provides critical spatially explicit information for supporting carbon emissions reduction, biodiversity, and restoration policies, enabling environmental science applications, territorial planning, and subsidizing environmental law enforcement.

TI  - Morphological and physiological responses to shade in seedlings of Parkia gigantocarpa Ducke and Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) Barneby (Leguminosae)
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the morphological and physiological responses and shade tolerance in two Amazonian tree seedling species under different shade intensities. Seedlings of P. gigantocarpa and S. parahyba were allocated to the following shade intensities: full sun, low, moderate and high (respectively, 0%, 23%, 67% and 73% of shade, or 2000, 1540, 660 and 540 mu mol(-2).s(-1)) obtained with polyethylene screens in a nursery seedling production. We measured the SPAD index, stomata conductance (gs), transpiration (E), photosynthesis (A) and biomass production. We also calculated the specific leaf area (SLA) and biomass allocation. The highest values of gs, E, A, and biomass production were found under full sun, in P. gigantocarpa, and at low shade intensity, in S. parahyba. In P gigantocarpa, the SPAD index (chlorophyll content) and SLA increased under increasing shade intensity; while in S. parahyba, the increase in shade intensity increased biomass allocated to leaves. Thus, as a strategy of its phenotypic plasticity, the studied species responded differently to shade intensity. Although P. gigantocarpa seedlings developed best under full sun and S. parahyba seedlings performed better under low shade intensity, both species survived the different shade intensities, being shade tolerant and adapted to reforestation programs.

TI  - Use of fuzzy systems in the elaboration of an anthropic pressure indicator to evaluate the remaining forest fragments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to develop a spatial analysis methodology with an inference fuzzy system using the geoprocessing techniques to generate an anthropic pressure indicator (API) based on two other indicators: Circularity Index (CI) and Edge Effects Index (EEI). This new methodology could indicate the remaining forest fragments exposition level after the anthropic action, considering the relationship between the geometry (CI) and the type of land use around the area (EEI) as the main factors. The studied area is located in the southwest part of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The obtained results show that rivers are often found as limits between fragments, demonstrating the importance of the preservation and conservation of riparian forest. In total, 846 forest fragments were identified, occupying 6.19 % of the study area, totalizing 2775.7 ha. Out of the total fragments 48.7 % were in medium and advanced successional stage of regeneration presenting elongated shapes and 16 % were in a high fragility interval, consequence of the edge effects. Moreover, the map of API showed that 16.2 % forest fragments were in a moderate high anthropic pressure interval, which deserve special attention for being very elongated, limited and pressured in an intense way by different types of land use which affect its surroundings. Thereby, the study demonstrated that the understanding of pressure types imposed on the remaining forest fragments through an indicator can contribute to management programs and territorial planning, giving conditions to the forest restoration in areas of strong anthropic pressure, and that the employment of fuzzy logics and geoprocessing could contribute significantly to diagnosis and trouble characterizations.

TI  - Risk of Collapse in Water Quality in the Guandu River (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guandu River, one of the main rivers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, provides water for more than nine million people in the metropolitan region. However, the Guandu has suffered from massive domestic and industrial pollution for more than two decades, leading to high levels of dissolved total phosphorus, cyanobacteria, and enteric bacteria observed during the summers of 2020 and 2021. The use of Phoslock, a palliative compound, was not effective in mitigating the levels of phosphorus in the Guandu River. Furthermore, potable water driven from the river had levels of 2-MIB/geosmin and a mud smell/taste. With all these problems, several solutions are proposed for improving the Guandu River water quality, including establishment of (i) sewage treatment plants (STPs), (ii) strict water quality monitoring, (iii) environmental recovery (e.g., reforestation), and (iv) permanent protected areas. The objective of this paper is to verify the poor water quality in the Guandu and the ineffectiveness and undesired effects of Phoslock.

TI  - The São Paulo State (Brazil) Ecological Fiscal Transfer: Distributive and environmental effects
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To restore 12 million hectares of native vegetation in Brazil by 2030, aligning environmental policies with incentive measures is crucial. The Ecological Fiscal Transfer (known as Ecological ICMS in Brazil) allows states to redistribute the ICMS tax (similar to the Value Added Tax) revenue based on environmental criteria, likely motivating municipalities to take environmental action. Sao Paulo recently modified its ecological ICMS legislation, increasing the ICMS revenue distributed according to environmental criteria and introducing a new criterion for native vegetation cover. We assessed the impact of these changes on tax redistribution, considering three scenarios: the former rules (2021), the new rules (2025), and the new rules with 1.5 million hectares of vegetation restored (2042). While the pattern of ICMS distribution remained mostly unchanged, there were distributional effects. Some municipalities lost up to 5% of their initial revenue, while others with high socio-environmental importance doubled their revenues. Existing environmental criteria still lack incentives for local environmental policies. However, the new criterion for native vegetation cover could, with practical limitations, boost municipal revenue after restoring 1.5 million hectares. Sao Paulo's initiative to incorporate native vegetation cover into an Ecological Fiscal Transfer policy holds the potential to inspire similar tax-based environmental incentives worldwide. However, it must be adapted to motivate local governments to embrace restoration actions rather than serving primarily as a compensatory measure.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

TI  - Soil quality assessment of constructed Technosols: Towards the validation of a promising strategy for land reclamation, waste management and the recovery of soil functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i. e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three(SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha(-1)). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years.

TI  - Differences in the Behavioral Parameters of Young Zebu and Composite Bulls Kept on Non-Forested or in Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry Systems
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The behavior of ruminants can influence their productive efficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of young zebu and composite bulls kept in pasture production systems, either in a crop-livestock-forest integration or without afforestation. The work was carried out in Sao Carlos, Brazil (21 degrees 57 ' 42 '' S, 47 degrees 50 ' 28 '' W), in a high-altitude tropical climate, from March to July, 2022. Forty young bulls were evaluated, being 20 Nelore (Bos indicus) (342.5 +/- 36.6 kg BW; 16.9 +/- 1.8 months) and 20 Canchim (5/8 Bos taurus x 3/8 Bos indicus) (338.4 +/- 39.8 kg BW; 19.1 +/- 1.9 months), equally distributed in full-sun (FS) and integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) production systems. Behavior was monitored uninterruptedly by an acoustic sensor and accelerometer attached to a collar, and complemented by direct visual assessment, in two one-day campaigns per month. Serum cortisol concentration was assessed monthly. Statistical analyses were conducted using a general linear model at a 5% significance level (SAS, version 9.4). The ICLF system had a milder microclimate and favored thermal comfort. Natural shading influenced grazing, resting, and rumination time. The Canchim bulls were more active when moving and grazing (p < 0.05), even at the hottest times of the day. In turn, the Nelore bulls spent more time resting at all times (p < 0.001), which was shown to be an adaptive strategy in response to environmental stimuli. The Canchim bulls had a longer rumination time than the Nelore bulls (p < 0.001), due to their longer grazing time. The frequency of water and mineral mixture intake did not differ between genotypes, regardless of the production system (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the serum cortisol concentrations of the Nelore and Canchim bulls kept in FS or ICLF (p = 0.082). Thus, young bulls of the different genotypes showed different behaviors, regardless of whether they were kept on pasture without afforestation or in an integrated crop-livestock-forestry system.

TI  - Adaptability of lettuce cultivars to planting in no-tillage on straw of Urochloa ruziziensis
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the adaptability of different lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cultivars grown in no-tillage on straw of ruzi grass (Urochloa ruziziensis), as well as its effects on soil temperature and weed control, in successive cultivations in the summer. The treatments were carried out in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates, in a split-plot arrangement (2x4), in which soil management (no-tillage on ruzi grass and convention tillage) was the main plot, and the different crisphead lettuce cultivars (Amanda, Solaris, Vanda, and Vera), the subplots. No difference was observed between cultivars for soil management. No-tillage reduced the soil temperature by up to 3.7 degrees C and weed density by 3.7 times, in comparison with conventional tillage. Ruzi grass promoted a greater bed conservation. In comparison to with conventional tillage, the no-tillage management of lettuce cultivated on ruzi grass straw resulted in a lower yield in the first crop due to excess straw; in a similar yield in the second crop; and in a greater yield in the third crop. Lettuce cultivated on ruzi grass straw in no-tillage management results in a greater sustainability, in comparison with conventional tillage, in three successive plantings.

TI  - Erosion Risk Mapping Applied to Environmental Zoning
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water erosion caused by inappropriate land use compromises the ecosystems and causes economic and social losses. To remedy this, the present study proposes (i) the evaluation of the erosion risk in an Environmental Protection Area (EPA) with the combination of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), soil loss tolerance (T) estimates adapted to Brazilian soils and the legislation; and (ii) control measures from environmental zoning. This was applied to the EPA of Lageado stream, one of the main surface water sources in Campo Grande, Brazil. Several referenced information plans were overlapped and the total area was divided into five zones with different land use profiles, which were determined according to the conservation and preservation of native vegetation, occurrence of wet areas and springs, land use and management, eroded area recovery and occurrence of permanently preserved areas. The methodology proposed was suitable for environmental zoning of protected areas. This protocol can be applied to other areas by including additional variables such as social and economic parameters.

TI  - Participatory ecosystem service mapping to enhance community-based mangrove rehabilitation and management in Demak, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (ES) is essential to understand and manage the contribution of these ecosystems to the well-being of local communities. They are the primary beneficiaries but their experience, knowledge, and information are frequently ignored in ES assessment and mapping. In this study, a participatory resource mapping (PRM) approach was applied using local knowledge and experience to analyze geo-referenced information on mangrove ecosystem services. Local communities were involved from the beginning in method selection, application, evaluation, and verification. This "inclusive participatory ES mapping" was conducted in two villages (Bedono and Timbulsloko, Central Java, Indonesia) from 2014 to 2015. Participants representing different community elements were involved in the mapping process. They first created a historical map of the situation in their villages roughly between 1980 and 1999 (before rehabilitation) and then described the subsequent environmental changes. The mapping exercise also documented different mangrove resources that are utilized by communities and identified key areas, such as harvesting zones, biodiversity hotspots, erosion zones, different fishing grounds, and newly rehabilitated areas. The maps reveal that integrating PRM and indigenous geo-referenced information can elicit past and contemporary information on (changes in) ecosystem service availability and use. The results show that by involving local communities from the beginning, the participatory ES mapping can facilitate social learning, provide the foundation for the creation of social capital, and equip the community with sufficient spatial information to improve local mangrove management. The participatory ES mapping approach presented in this paper can be used as a model to support local and regional decision-making processes and to enhance community-based mangrove management in other coastal regions in Indonesia and beyond.

TI  - Combining microsatellites, growth, and adaptive traits for managing in situ genetic resources of Eucalyptus urophylla
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Genetic diversity and structure of 17 populations representative of the natural range of Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Indonesia were analysed with 10 microsatellite markers. Two provenance and progeny trials, using the same populations, were established in the Republic of the Congo and analysed for growth and survival at 37 months. Observed microsatellite heterozygosity (H-o) was moderate to high within populations (H-o = 0.51-0.72). The index of fixation (F-IS) was significantly different from zero for all populations (F-IS = 0.13-0.31) and possibly resulted from a Wahlund effect. The differentiation parameter was low (F-ST = 0.04) and not significantly different from zero, which can be explained by effective gene flow via pollen. The genetic variances within and among provenances for survival and growth traits were significantly different from zero, representing 13%-23% and 14%-50% of the total variation, respectively. The differentiation between populations based on quantitative traits was marked (Q(ST) = 0.07-0.33). A negative relationship between altitude of the seed source and its performance in the Congo was observed (R-2 = 0.59-0.67) and could be explained by the effect of natural selection along the altitudinal gradient. This marked differentiation for quantitative traits despite high apparent gene flow results in a clinal variation, which suggests the use of altitude of seed source as an important principle for in situ or ex situ management of E. urophylla genetic resources.

TI  - Temporal analysis of desertification vulnerability in Northeast Brazil using Google Earth Engine
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive agricultural production has negative environmental impacts, increasing predisposition to desertification in areas with inadequate soil management. To evaluate the effects of agriculture, we aimed to perform a temporal analysis and analyze the development of desertification in Northeast Brazil. Initially, the region was separated into four climatic zones, grouping the locations with similar characteristics of air temperature and rainfall. In the analyses, images of the northeast region acquired from the Landsat 5 (1989, 1999, and 2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellites were processed using the Google Earth Engine platform. The periods were separated into dry and rainy periods, according to the climatic zones. The evaluation of vegetation index, characterization of the remaining vegetation cover, landscape pattern, and meteorological conditions were performed, respectively, through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, and albedo of the terrestrial surface. The desertification index showed an increase in susceptible areas when comparing the interval from 1989 to 2019. In general, our results showed that there is less predisposition for desertification to occur during the rainy season. Also, when the results of our study were compared to official data released by the National Program of Action to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought, there was disagreement regarding the classification of areas.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional threshold responses of vertebrate communities in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological thresholds are an indicator of rapid and non-linear changes along both natural habitat and land-use gradients. Thus, they can be used to quantify biodiversity responses to human-induced environmental change. We investigated multiple thresholds by analyzing eight environmental predictors of both taxonomic and functional composition of amphibian and bird communities in 47 independent sample units, located within a heterogeneous land use matrix of the megadiverse Atlantic Forest hotspot. We demonstrate that current land use practices alter both the taxonomic and functional composition and promote the establishment of non-native taxa resulting in novel assemblages. Whereas anuran communities experienced dramatic compositional shifts as a result of the transformation of closed forest habitats into Eucalyptus monocultures (at less than 10% land cover), bird communities were mainly altered through the loss of old-growth forest (at 20% forest cover loss). In both groups, observed thresholds were lower than previously reported and much lower than the 20% forest set-aside requirement defined by current land-use legislation. We argue that the strategy of halting forest loss through rapid afforestation with non-native trees has converse and potentially detrimental effects on the conservation of native forest biodiversity. Future studies need to investigate how including novel assemblages in current conservation management strategies can enhance biodiversity protection in human-impacted forest landscapes. The identification of taxon-specific thresholds for both taxonomic and functional community shifts is indispensable when formulating common land use practices and designing mitigation measures. Threshold analyses can guide these actions by providing clear and quantifiable break-points for conservation practitioners.

TI  - A genetic approach for simulating persistence of reintroduced tree species populations in restored forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals, isolated from neighboring populations, and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human-modified landscapes. Resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas. Such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances. However, the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated. We present an individual-based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of: 1) differing levels of initial genetic diversity; and 2) different area sizes on short (tens of years) and mid-term (hundreds of years) restored population viability. We demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of Centrolobium tomentosum, a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics, from tropical and temperate forests, to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size. This knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions, increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs.

TI  - Community forest governance and synergies among carbon, biodiversity and livelihoods
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration has emerged as a key strategy to sequester atmospheric carbon and conserve biodiversity while providing livelihood co-benefits for indigenous peoples and local communities. Using a dataset of 314 forest commons in human-dominated landscapes in 15 tropical countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, we examine the relationships among carbon sequestered in above-ground woody biomass, tree species richness and forest livelihoods. We find five distinct clusters of forest commons, with co-benefits and trade-offs on multiple dimensions. The presence of a formal community management association and local participation in rule-making are consistent predictors of multiple positive outcomes. These findings, drawn from a range of contexts globally, suggest that empowered local forest governance may support multiple objectives of forest restoration. Our analysis advances understanding of institutional aspects of restoration while underscoring the importance of analysing the interconnections among multiple forest benefits to inform effective interventions for multifunctional tropical forests.Forest restoration is emerging as a key climate mitigation strategy. In this study, the authors find that formalized local control and substantive involvement in rule-making are associated with synergies for carbon sequestration, biodiversity and rural livelihoods.

TI  - Do alien species dominate plant communities undergoing restoration? A case study in the Brazilian savanna
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the principles established by the Society for Ecological Restoration International - SER is that the use of exotic species for restoration purposes should be avoided, and this is outlined on the two first attributes expected of a restored ecosystem by the SER Primer. This recommendation is possibly based on the hypothesis that exotics will dominate the restored communities and jeopardize the local biodiversity. We assessed the current plant community in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado undergoing restoration, where 42 species - 6 natives and 36 non-natives were planted, and compared it with the contiguous native community. We aimed at verifying if the surrounding native community has been invaded by alien species, and if the community being restored has been dominated by the latter, not resembling the native flora. Eight years after planting, the alien species were not recorded in the surrounding native ecosystem. In the community undergoing restoration, despite 94% of the planted trees being exotics (86% of the species) they corresponded to only 3% of plants regenerating (14% of the species), indicating that floristic similarity with the native vegetation is increasing over time. We consider that the non-native species planted do not offer threat to the native ecosystems in the vicinity, and tend to be defeated by the natives in the long term. Even though, public policies should prioritize and make feasible the use of native species, better adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Cerrado.

TI  - An Assessment of the Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) Strategy for Irrigated Rice in Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) strategy provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice (Oryza sativa) production. The SSNM fertilizer recommendations are based on the yield goal approach, which has been frequently cited in empirical studies. This study evaluates the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice-producing countries around the world, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explore whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). The results suggest the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites-some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. The SOM also significantly affects the nitrogen fertilizer uptake. I conclude by suggesting that the SSNM strategy can be made to be more adaptive to farmer's fields if these relationships are accounted for in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm.

TI  - Genomic population structure of Parkia platycephala Benth. (Leguminosae) from Northeastern Brazil
T2  - GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Parkia platycephala Benth. is a native species with high nutritional and ecological potential that is used in forest recovery and restoration. However, studies on the diversity and population genetic structure of this species are limited. Therefore, 5036 nucleotide polymorphism loci (resulting from genotyping by sequencing) were used to investigate the diversity and population structure of P. platycephala in two localities of Northeast Brazil. One of the evaluated areas comprised the Conservation Unit, Sete Cidades National Park, the other location consisted of the trees located around the park. A high level of genetic diversity was found for both populations, with similar values of expected heterozygosity (H-E = 0.29), showing the existence of a considerable level of genetic variation. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the diversity (99.06%) was distributed within populations. The results of the genetic structuring indicated little divergence between the plants, suggesting that the evaluated groups could be considered a single population. Few loci under selection (outliers) were identified; thus, no significant evidence of adaptive divergence was found. The results indicate that P. platycephala trees inside and outside the Conservation Unit maintain high genetic diversity, which has potential for use in breeding programs and for the production of seedlings for forest restoration. Furthermore, the importance of the Sete Cidades National Park for in situ conservation of this species is highlighted.

TI  - How long does the Amazon rainforest take to grow commercially sized trees? An estimation methodology for Manilkara elata (Allemao ex Miq.) Monach
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to know the growth rate of the species to be managed to establish sustainable forest management plans because from this information, it is possible to know which species have reached the minimum commercial size to be collected in future harvests. Manilkara elata (Allemao ex Miq.) Monach is considered one of the most commercialized timber tree species, both inside and outside of Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to model the growth rate and the time required for the trees of this species to reach the minimum cutting diameter defined by the current Brazilian legislation; the analysis was based on the adapted Weibull function with data from 31 years of monitoring in the National Forest of Brazil in Tapajos, Path, Amazon, Brazil. Three models were proposed to estimate (i) the annual periodic increase in diameter (API), (ii) the future diameter (dt) and (iii) the time period in years (t) that each tree would need to reach a future diameter according to the average growth rate of the target species and its forest community. Taken together, the data from the managed and unmanaged areas showed no statistically significant differences between the values observed and estimated by the proposed model when assessed with the Graybill F test. The adapted Weibull model performed well when estimating the annual periodic increment and future tree diameter of the M elata population. Based on the diameter growth rate, the 5 cm diameter M. elata trees would require 601-781 years to reach the minimum commercial diameter of 50 cm, but the 40-49.9 cm diameter trees that are considered stock for the next harvest would take an average of 20 years to reach this commercial diameter. As the estimated average growth time is shorter than the cutting cycle prescribed by the legislation (25-35 years), it is recommended that forestry treatments that favor longer survival of M. elata individuals be adopted to achieve greater continuous production by primarily considering the long period that young individuals need to reach the cutting diameter.

TI  - Differences in the Behavioral Parameters of Young Zebu and Composite Bulls Kept on Non-Forested or in Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry Systems.
T2  - Animals
M3  - Article
AB  - The behavior of ruminants can influence their productive efficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of young zebu and composite bulls kept in pasture production systems, either in a crop-livestock-forest integration or without afforestation. The work was carried out in Sao Carlos, Brazil (21[degree]57'42'' S, 47[degree]50'28'' W), in a high-altitude tropical climate, from March to July, 2022. Forty young bulls were evaluated, being 20 Nelore (Bos indicus) (342.5 [plus or minus] 36.6 kg BW; 16.9 [plus or minus] 1.8 months) and 20 Canchim (5/8 Bos taurus x 3/8 Bos indicus) (338.4 [plus or minus] 39.8 kg BW; 19.1 [plus or minus] 1.9 months), equally distributed in full-sun (FS) and integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) production systems. Behavior was monitored uninterruptedly by an acoustic sensor and accelerometer attached to a collar, and complemented by direct visual assessment, in two one-day campaigns per month. Serum cortisol concentration was assessed monthly. Statistical analyses were conducted using a general linear model at a 5% significance level (SAS, version 9.4). The ICLF system had a milder microclimate and favored thermal comfort. Natural shading influenced grazing, resting, and rumination time. The Canchim bulls were more active when moving and grazing (p < 0.05), even at the hottest times of the day. In turn, the Nelore bulls spent more time resting at all times (p < 0.001), which was shown to be an adaptive strategy in response to environmental stimuli. The Canchim bulls had a longer rumination time than the Nelore bulls (p < 0.001), due to their longer grazing time. The frequency of water and mineral mixture intake did not differ between genotypes, regardless of the production system (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the serum cortisol concentrations of the Nelore and Canchim bulls kept in FS or ICLF (p = 0.082). Thus, young bulls of the different genotypes showed different behaviors, regardless of whether they were kept on pasture without afforestation or in an integrated crop-livestock-forestry system.

TI  - Flood vulnerability level analysis as a hydrological disaster mitigation effort in Krueng Jreue Sub-Watershed, Aceh Besar, Indonesia
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The flood phenomenon in the Krueng Jreue Sub-Watershed, Aceh Besar, Indonesia, in recent years indicates biophysical damage to the land. Floods are influenced by factors from biophysical conditions of the land and high rainfall with small river cross-sectional capacity causing water to overflow the embankment and flood low areas. This research aims to analyse the flood vulnerability level in the Krueng Jreue Sub-Watershed, Aceh Besar, Indonesia. The results showed that flood vulnerability in the research area consisted of four classes: very vulnerable, vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and somewhat vulnerable, with each area averaging a score of 43.0, 38.8, 30.0 and 21.7. Types of land use that are particularly vulnerable to flooding are rice fields with a mean total score of 43.0. The vulnerable classes are found in settlements and moorings, with a total score of 42.0 and 36.5, respectively. While open land, shrubs, grasslands, primary forests and secondary forests are quite vulnerable to flooding, with a mean total score of 32.5 each: 30.0, 30.0, 28.0 and 27.0. The main components affecting flood vulnerability are rainfall, temperature and land use, while additional components are soil infiltration and slope. Mechanised hydrological disaster mitigation can be performed through optimisation of weir, embung, rorak and check-dam. Vegetative hydrological mitigation efforts can be performed by reforestation and agroforestry systems, maps and flood prediction. Non-technically, hydrological disaster mitigation efforts can be undertaken with legal policies, law enforcement, map creation and prediction of droughts and socialisation of legislation.

TI  - Opinions on legality principles considered in the FLEGT/VPA policy in Ghana and Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade programme (FLEGT) of the European Union aims at stimulating both legal timber production and good forest governance. The EU establishes Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with individual tropical timber exporting countries; these VPAs should be developed through a stakeholder-inclusive governance process and define national standards for timber legality. The national policy level serves as an interface between the EU policy and the local realities of forest exploitation. This article assesses whether new assemblages of timber legality standards were developed at this interface. It presents the opinions of people actively engaged in the FLEGT/VPA process in Ghana (n=38) and Indonesia (n=40) about which principles regarding timber legality, law enforcement and social safeguards were considered during the VPA negotiations' in each country. Almost half of the respondents (44%) were positive about the integrative focus of VPA discussions focusing on both forestry and livelihood issues, 40% considered it had mostly a limited focus or traditional timber sector focus, and 16% indicated a high degree of attention to social responsibility issues. There were differences in the characteristics of respondents and their opinions between Ghana and Indonesia; these reflect differences in organisation of the FLEGT/VPA process. The findings demonstrate how depending on country-specific policy processes principles from an international forest policy are adapted at national level; this may involve new assemblages of the original policy principles.

TI  - Study of Potential Ecotourism in Rehabilitation Zone of Argowulan Block, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park.
T2  - International Journal of Ecosystem
M3  - Article
AB  - The research aimed to explore ecotourism potential; determine the targeted visiting tourist; design ecotourism activities and to optimize the management of rehabilitation zone at Argowulan Block, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (BTSNP). Data collections of ecotourism potential object, infrastructures, targeted tourists, and conditions of location were carried out by direct observation in the field, interview, and literature search. Data analysis used tabulation, VAC, SWOT, and IVI of plants species. The results showed that the ecotourism potential of Argowulan Block included unique flora, fauna, forest ecosystem, natural panorama, culture and religious heritage of Tengger Hindunese community within location. Among the unique flora which can be found in the area was the endemic species of mentigi plant (Vaccinium varingefolium). There was no tourist specificity who come to Argowulan Block, because this location is yet to be promoted as a new destination area of BTSNP. The targeted potential tourists are those who visit Mount Penanjakan, and those who are interested in reforestation at BTSNP area. Special interest ecotourism themed EDU -RESTRO TOURISM was a proposed ecotourism theme which was developed at Argowulan Block. The activities involved under the proposed theme were tree planting, tree adopting, tree growth measurement, and flora & fauna observation. These ecotourism activities werw distributed in five clusters wherein each cluster has different potential, so the visitors may choose their specific activities offered from different clusters. In addition, it is possible join eco-tourism activities in all the clusters. The fact of this research shows the restored area might be managed for specific interest tourism without waiting for its recovery, if it has a potential tourism. The rehabilitation zone can be used for activities which generate revenue and profit to the area manager, if the activities and visiting patterns are well planned and give conducive conditions for plant growth and safe habitat for fauna. Hence, visiting tourists are not only benefiting from the conservation effort, but they also themselves participate in the conservation activities (planting, forest protection, forest fire mitigation). Track design is necessary to facilitate tourism activities in each cluster and regulate visitors' circulations. In the ordinance of P 56/Menhut-II/2006 about National Park Zonation, there is no activity description to be applied in a rehabilitation zone. The result of this research recommends reforming the ordinance of National Park zonation.

T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The planning and management of street trees are indispensable for sustainable urban development and requires knowledge of the existing situation. The identification of forest species which are present on streets and their distributions is essential to support the adequate planning of street afforestation. This information enables to carry out the general characterization of the place of interest and identify priority areas for management actions. Thus, the present study aimed to identify priority areas for interventions in urban street trees of Sao Pedro do Sul and to verify the influence of exotic species on the diversity index. A census was carried out collecting information about the tree species and their geographic positions, checking it with the specialized literature. The frequencies for families and species were obtained, the Shannon-Wiener index (H ') was calculated for species diversity. The spatialization of trees within the limits of neighborhoods and roads was carried out using a Kernel map. Finally, the density of individuals per kilometer of road in each neighborhood was obtained. 3365 trees were cataloged, of which 98 were not possible to be identifiable. The presence of 91 species was registered, distributed in 34 families. The Fabaceae family obtained the highest density of individuals (19.55%). Exotic species concentrated 63.98 % of the population, with Ligustrum lucidum being the most frequent species (15.66%). The municipality obtained average values of 41.18 trees per kilometer of road and a diversity index of 3.22. The attention index made it possible to identify the neighborhoods with the greatest need for adaptation in terms of the density of road afforestation. The Kernel map made it possible to visualize the distribution of the road afforestation. It was also observed that the diversity of tree species measured in each neighborhood is represented essentially by invasive alien species and that as the diversity values increase, the composition of afforestation with invasive species trees stands out.

AB  - The present world population of 6 billion will reach 8 billion by 2020 and 9.4 billion by 2050. By then, the population will have increased by another 575 million in India, 300 million in China, 200 million in Nigeria, 200 million in Pakistan, and 140 million in Ethiopia. Of the total world population, 8.2 billion will live in developing countries, of which 3 billion will reside in arid and semiarid environments. Thus, soil management challenges for developing countries include achieving food security with minimal risks to environment given per capita land area decreasing to <0.1 ha and per capita irrigated land area to <0.04 ha, severe scarcity of renewable fresh water resources, high risks of soil degradation by a wide range of degradative processes, resource-poor farmers, and weak institutional support. Productivity loss attributable to erosion-caused soil degradation is estimated at 18 million Mg of food staples per year at the 1990 level of yields for subSaharan Africa and 272 million Mg for the world at the 1996 level of production. The productivity loss at a landscape level may range from 0 (or even positive effect) to total crop failure. In addition to enhancing productivity per unit area and per unit time, soil management technologies must also address pressing environmental issues, especially with regard to the greenhouse effect and air quality, water quality, and land application of industrial and urban wastes. Enhancing food production would necessitate adoption of land saving technologies through agricultural intensification on prime agricultural land, conversion of marginal lands to other appropriate land uses, and restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems. Soil-specific technologies for agricultural intensification will have to be developed, fine-tuned, and adopted. These technologies will address the issue of (i) enhancing soil structure, (ii) increasing nutrient use efficiency through integrated nutrient management and strengthening nutrient recycling mechanisms, (iii) conserving soil and water through residue management and adoption of conservation tillage, (iv) improving water use efficiency through development and adoption of efficient methods of water harvesting, recycling and irrigation, and (v) increasing cropping intensity. Improvements in rainfed agriculture through water conservation and enhancing water and nutrient use efficiencies will be a major challenge in subSaharan Africa, India, Central Asian countries, northeastern Brazil, and other semiarid regions of the developing world. Preventing and restoring degraded soils, enhancing soil C sequestration to mitigate the greenhouse effect, and decreasing risks of eutrophication of surface water and contamination of ground water will be priority issues. Soil scientists will need to work closely with those in the basic sciences to address the environmental concerns of agricultural intensification. There is a strong need for high quality, credible, innovative, original, and demand-driven research in soil science in developing countries. Research managers can facilitate achievements of goals of high quality science by creating a conducive and trustworthy work atmosphere and by rewarding productivity and merit.

TI  - Financial assessment of community forest management: lessons from a cross-sectional study of timber management systems in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the financial feasibility of externally-driven community forestry management (CFM), this study assesses twelve CFM systems in the Brazilian Amazon classified as particularly successful by supporting organizations. The study showed that significant investments were necessary to set up the initiatives, including pre-financing the annual operational costs. Only three of the twelve management systems were found to be financially viable. These successful cases were able to follow the Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) guidelines due to the large scale of their operations. The smaller initiatives were not financially autonomous. The findings indicate that the legal regulations and technical principles of the CFM approach do not correspond to the capacities and realities of typical local forest users in the Brazilian Amazon. There is an urgent need to better adapt this approach to the interests and capacities of local resource users.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Mitigation through Sustainable Intensification of Livestock Production in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - EUROCHOICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are projected to reach 3.2 gigatonnes (CO2 eq.) by 2020. The government has made a voluntary commitment to reduce this figure by 40 per cent. A reduction in deforestation and livestock mitigation measures are key components of this commitment. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian Savannah), we analyse abatement potential and cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation measures applicable to livestock production. We focus on the role of intensification measures, particularly pasture restoration and animal performance to meet the objectives of increasing beef production to meet higher demand, while simultaneously reducing emissions. We use a linear programming model that optimises pasture intensification levels according to biophysical and economic parameters and growth in beef demand. We estimate changes in soil carbon stocks generated by pasture management and land use change. According to a baseline projection, beef production in the Cerrado accounts for an average of approximately 122 million tonnes of CO2 eq. per year from 2010 to 2030. The results of our analysis suggest that by implementing cost-effective measures, projected emissions in the region could be reduced by around 24 per cent. Pasture restoration, which will reduce deforestation, is the largest contributor to these results.

TI  - Role of Tree Vegetation and Associated Environmental Factors on the Understory Herb-Layer Composition in a Reforested Area: A Study from "Kulon Progo Community Forestry"
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the understory herb-layer species composition in response to tree vegetation and its associated environmental factors in the reforested area of the Kulon Progo Community Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The understory herb-layer composition among different stand types, including Pinus (PN), Aleurites-Swietenia (AS), Swietenia-Acacia (SA), Melaleuca-Acacia (MA) and Tectona-Dalbergia (TD), was compared using some comparison analyses. The influence of tree vegetation characteristics and associated environmental factors on the understory herb-layer species was analyzed by employing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Our result showed variation in understory herb-layer species composition despite equality in richness and diversity indices. Among all stand types, the MA stand showed fewer shade-tolerant species, and the TD stand exhibited the smallest number of shade-intolerant species. Seedling availability also varied between AS and MA, which contained fewer seedling species. One of the main species in the two stands did not even regenerate. Moreover, all indicator species in MA were shade-intolerant species with invasive characteristics, while those in TD were shade-tolerant and semi-shade-tolerant species. CCA showed that stand types held an important role in the herb-layer species composition, where the number of shade-tolerant and seedling species commonly native to forest were directly proportional to tree canopy coverage, silt proportion in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon yet inversely proportional to below-stand utilization. In contrast, the number of shade-intolerant species had positive correlation to below-stand utilization and inversely to other correlated factors. Our study also indicated the possibility of tree vegetation controlling several environmental factors, where the increase in canopy coverage was followed by an increasing proportion of silt in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon, as well as a decreasing percentage of below-stand utilization. Accordingly, we recommend tree species enrichment with dense-canopy trees and adaptive management of below-stand utilization for better forest development and tree regeneration. This finding provides important knowledge for evaluation and improvement in the ecological restoration of degraded forests.

TI  - Intensive silvicultural practices drive the forest restoration in southern Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of degraded environments is a challenging process due to the presence of adverse factors, which can prevent the establishment and development of forest species. The use of appropriate methods and species, which are able to adapt to the soil and climatic conditions, enable successful conservation plantings. Herein, we aim to identify the performance of native forest species grown under two planting models and different silvicultural practices in a degraded riparian area in the extreme south of the Atlantic Forest Biome. The experiment was initiated in September 2015 with a randomized block design arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme (three silvicultural practices and two planting models). We evaluated the performance of nine native species by the analysis of morphological (i.e., survival, height, and stem diameter) and physiological attributes (i.e., photosynthetic pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence). The use of intensive silvicultural practices in restoration plantations maximized tree survival rates, height, and stem growth, and provided better values for the physiological attributes. The two planting models tested in this study (i.e., "framework species" and diversity) can be used in future restoration projects in subtropical regions associated with intensive silvicultural practices. Solanum mauritianum, among other studied species, presented excellent rates of survival and growth. Several secondary species (e.g., Actinostemon concolor, Trichilia elegans, and Eugenia rostrifolia) propagated from the seedling transplants, also showed the potential to enrich forest plantations in degraded environments.

TI  - Knowledge Management System for Forest and Land Fire Mitigation in Indonesia: A Web-Based Application Development
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and land fires in Indonesia have serious impacts on many aspects, including the environment, health, economy, politics, and international relations. They cause haze pollution that extends to neighboring countries and peatland degradation. Despite extensive research and mitigation efforts, forest and land fires continue to occur and cost lives. Therefore, effective management and mitigation strategies are required. This research developed a webbased knowledge management system (KMS) using the Laravel framework as an effective forest and land fire mitigation platform. The KMS aims to support decision -making, facilitate knowledge exchange, improve coordination between stakeholders, and expand access to relevant information, while maintaining the sustainability of forest and land resources in Indonesia. The KMS evaluation results cover two important aspects: blackbox evaluation and Performance Evaluation. The blackbox evaluation showed that KMS provides knowledge retrieval features based on expert knowledge. The Performance Evaluation revealed that the KMS provides easy and quick access to information on forest and land fire prevention and management. Thus, this research has great potential to help overcome the problem of forest and land fires in Indonesia and protect the environment and society from their adverse effects.

TI  - The Restoration of Degraded Landscapes along the Urban-Rural Gradient of Lubumbashi City (Democratic Republic of the Congo) by Acacia auriculiformis Plantations: Their Spatial Dynamics and Impact on Plant Diversity
T2  - ECOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A. auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis along the urban-rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A. auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations, including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A. auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A. auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their role in the restoration of degraded lands.

TI  - Applying an ecological restoration approach to study patient safety culture in an intensive care unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims and objectivesTo gain an understanding of medication safety culture and other quality issues in a Brazilian intensive care unit using a restorative approach.BackgroundPatient safety should be considered one of the pillars of quality in health care. Thus, patient safety culture is increasingly being explored as a guide for quality improvement efforts.DesignA qualitative approach.MethodsParticipatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration were adapted in this study. This study used focus groups, then subsequent nurse-led photo-narrated walkabouts, and photo elicitation with 23 nurses and one physician in interactive phases of data collection and analysis over an eight-month timeframe.ResultsThe core themes identified were: the medication system shapes patient safety' and the feeling of helplessness in the face of the prevailing organization culture'. Participants discussed supports exiting in the intensive care unit that shape medication safety, the barriers that impede safe medication management, the solutions to improve medication safety and the creation of a better medication safety culture.ConclusionsThe methods used allowed participants to visualise sound practices as well as key safety issues, reflect on their day-to-day work, re-think potential improvements, and enact changes to improve medication safety and medication safety culture. However, the patient safety culture is also marked by administrative pressure. The hospital needs to adopt participatory management, where the health professionals can act together with the organisational leaders to promote a just culture.Relevance to clinical practiceThe participatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration provided participants with a tool to promote patient safety culture and engage policy change dialogue. However, it will be important in future restorative research to track-specific safety outcomes over time to assess the cost-benefit of the adoption of participatory management models.

TI  - To graze or not to graze: A core question for conservation and sustainable use of grassy ecosystems in Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Differently from commonly used forest conservation strategies, the absence of disturbance in non-forest ecosystems can result in loss of biodiversity. Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered.

TI  - Information exchange in swidden communities of West Kalimantan: lessons for designing REDD
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested areas of Kalimantan, Indonesia, are often inhabited by swiddeners, and are also targeted by a range of interventions related to development and forest conservation, including REDD+. Whether these interventions are adopted, adapted or rejected by the local people is linked to the varying degrees of access to information that different types of households have, which also leads to unequal sharing of the associated benefits. This paper analyses factors influencing household access to agriculture and forestry-related information using quantitative and qualitative methods in three communities in West-Kalimantan, and draws lessons for designing REDD+. Household socio-economic characteristics (origin, status, migration patterns) and the divide between sub-groups in the communities (caused by origin, opinions, residential location, and relationships) were found to influence household access to information. Suggestions for improved REDD+ information exchange include: having more targeted and incentivised REDD+ activities; encouraging more equitable information sharing; and taking better account of local realities while designing REDD+.

TI  - Wildfires Jeopardise Habitats of Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), a Flagship Species for the Conservation of the Brazilian Pantanal.
T2  - Wetlands
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in fire regimes can increase extinction risk of species with distribution restricted to fire-prone habitats. The extent of the area burnt in the Brazilian Pantanal reached a record high in 2020, resulting in an environmental catastrophe. This globally important wetland is the main area of occurrence of the Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). Distribution modelling suggests that the macaw occupies areas, where its major food sources, the palms Attalea phalerata and Acrocomia Aculeata are present and Sterculia apetala provides nesting hollows. To estimate the proportion of suitable habitat lost to fire over the years, we overlaid modelled distributions of the macaw and two plant species (Attalea phalerata and Sterculia apetala) with the extent of area burnt in the Pantanal in 2003-2020. We estimated the phenological predictability of the two food plants and evaluated the consequences of fire on the availability of these resources. Considering historical fire recurrence data, Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, Sterculia apetala, and Attalea phalerata are predominantly present in areas with no or low annual fire occurrence. We found that over 25% of Hyacinth Macaw habitat had been affected by fire in 2020, which is about five times higher than the historical annual average. The length and seasonality of the fire season was confirmed by circular statistics, suggesting that the number of large fires increased in 2020 compared to the historical series. Consequently, in the catastrophic season of 2020, wildfires were much more extensive and occurred earlier in the year. We did not detect significant correlation between food availability and historical fire seasonality. Hence, it difficult to predict how changes in the temporal pattern of fires may affect resource availability for the macaw. Moreover, the macaw's peak egg laying occurs in August and nestlings hatch around September, and habitat loss resulting from megafires can compromise the conservation of even large, flying species. This justifies adaptive fire management as an important conservation action to preserve suitable habitat for the Hyacinth Macaw.

TI  - Water Pollution of Some Major Rivers in Indonesia: The Status, Institution, Regulation, and Recommendation for Its Mitigation
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - River water pollution is a significant environmental problem in Indonesia. On the other hand, river water is an important source of drinking water. Therefore, clean and safe water has become a priority program of the Government and is parallel with the international agreement known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rapid population growth and industrialization cause inadequate access to safe water; only 73% of Indonesian people can access safe water. This review paper aims to present a comprehensive discussion concerning water pollution in four big rivers, i.e., Siak, Citarum, Bengawan Solo, and Brantas Rivers, that have experienced pollution and provide alternative solutions to mitigate the pollution. Data were collected from related institutions, governments' regulations, the authors' experiences, and literature studies. Developing a riparian zone with multiple ecological services and introducing Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor and provide real-time water quality information is essential for mitigating river water pollution. Law enforcement is an alternative method to reduce point -source pollutants from industries. Non -point source pollutants from domestic and agricultural wastes may be reduced through spreading awareness and implementing personal and environmental hygiene, involving the community in designing, as well as monitoring and evaluating water quality. Those approaches should be accompanied by proper institutions, regulations, and policies.

TI  - Market-based commons: Social agroforestry, fire mitigation strategies, and green supply chains in Indonesia's peatlands
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops the transboundary concept of market-based commons to explore how partial and incomplete privatisation measures are contributing to the creation, operation, and maintenance of common property in agrarian societies embedded in global economies. Focusing on Indonesia's Riau province, I show how transboundary publics and geographically dispersed users of peatland resources collectively engage in environmental stewardship around sustainable forms of peatland development and activities aimed at mitigating the socio-ecological costs of growth. The paper explores three types of peatland commons centred on social agroforestry using paludiculture (wet cultivation) techniques, fire mitigation strategies, and green supply chains around sustainable peatland products. I argue that while these market-based commons are still in their infancy, they inscribe a specific set of transboundary governance relationships that seek to reform rather than resist capitalism by promoting both the protective and protective functions of carbon-rich peatlands as profitable environmental goods of public value.

TI  - Examining the Adequacy of Legal and Institutional Frameworks of Land and Forest Fire Management from National to Community Levels in Indonesia
T2  - DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN INDONESIA: PROGRESS, CHALLENGES, AND ISSUES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Land and forest fires are increasingly becoming annual disasters in Indonesia and have a significant impact on biodiversity, health, the economy and carbon dioxide emissions. Human activities such as the clearing of forests and land for plantations and agriculture have been attributed as the major causes of these fires. They have also been associated with the impacts of El-Nino.This chapter aims to examine the adequacy of current legal and institutional frameworks for land and forest fire risk management (LFFRM) in Indonesia, from the national to local level, through utilizing a disaster risk management approach, and thereby assess progress and challenges in managing land and forest fires during the prevention and mitigation, emergency response and post-fires rehabilitation and recovery phases. This study involves a literature review of related government regulations and academic publications, as well as interviews with government officials, the community and NGOs at the local level, conducted in two provinces: South Sumatra and Central Kalimantan.The study has three major findings. First, the institutional and regulatory framework for managing land/peatland fires is not integrated with that of forest fires. Second, a lack of law enforcement hinders prevention and mitigation. Third, current institutional and regulatory frameworks are still very much focused on emergency response. Moreover, progress is slower at lower levels of governance and community livelihood has failed to be integrated into the process. We recommend that governments, from the national to sub-national and local levels, develop a more comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach with community-based livelihood activities at its core, and commit to stricter law enforcement, especially for those private sector companies responsible for large-scale fires.

TI  - Strategies for herbivory mitigation by capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris in a riparian forest under restoration in the Sao Francisco river basin Brazil
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the potential use of diversionary feeding and behavior-contingent sonic deterrents to mitigate the herbivory impacts of capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris on a riparian forest restoration site in the watershed of the Velhas River, the main tributary of the S. Francisco River in southeastern Brazil. Paspalum notatum, popularly known as batatais or bahia grass, was chosen as a diversionary food candidate and motion-activated sonic alarms were used as deterrents. A field experiment was conducted to compare the plant cover and the damage incidence in a fenced-off control on open plots with and without sonic deterrents. In these plots, P. notatum was cultivated alongside other restoration species of interest. Capybaras distinctly preferred P. notatum, which suffered 8.14-fold greater damage than other species and suffered coverage losses of up to 40% outside of the control plots, whereas the remaining species showed no difference from the control. The sonic deterrents did not influence the soil cover by any of the species, but did mitigate the damage to P. notatum independently of time. The damage was 93% more prevalent in the plots without deterrents. This success was partial, however, because damage also occurred in the presence of the deterrents. P. notatum was efficient at attracting and concentrating the interest of capybaras and therefore showed promise as a cover crop to protect other species of interest. Overall, the results of this study suggest that P. notatum is more efficient than electronic deterrents to protect a forest under restoration process against capybara damage.

TI  - Evaluating a forestry partnership between a private company and local people in East Kalimantan, Indonesia: a political ecology approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The national social forestry program, launched to encompass 12.7 million hectares, aims to maintain sustainable forest management, to empower local people in their socioeconomic lives, to open job employment, and to mitigate land tenure conflicts. Community empowerment through forestry partnerships between private companies and local communities seeks to provide the benefit of optimal forest resource management and to operate fairly in order to improve the welfare of local communities. In this sense, the goal is for the local community to benefit directly through strengthening capacity and gradually develop into a strong economic actor - independent, responsible and professional. This article aims to accomplish two critical objectives: 1) to examine the significance of forestry partnerships as media of local people's empowerment in their socioeconomic lives; and 2) to explore joint forest management (JFM) in regard to collaboration among actors - private companies, academics, NGOs, local governments and local communities - in the management of agroforestry and promotion of ecotourism through better facilities and management of such attractions as the Tambalang Waterfall in East Kalimantan. Findings indicate that the forestry partnerships under the aegis of the social forestry program can have very positive effects in terms of mitigating land tenure conflict, building local infrastructure such as roads and drainage facilities to prevent floods, soil erosion, and other disasters, and empowering local people in the framework of an agroforestry program. This study used a qualitative approach, including such methods as in-depth interviews, participatory observation and library research. A variant of political ecology was used as a theoretical framework in order to emphasise the role of actors in the program.

TI  - Adaptation of a spatially explicit individual tree-based growth and yield model and long-term comparison between reduced-impact and conventional logging in eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timber logging is one of the main land uses in the Brazilian Amazon. Despite its recognized potential as a sustainable activity, logging is generally conducted in an unsustainable or predatory manner, with significant negative environmental impact. There is increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable practices and reduced-impact logging (RIL) is gaining acceptance as a more environmentally benign alternative to unplanned, conventional logging (CL). Comparisons of these two harvest systems have largely focused on differences in efficiency (financial) and immediate impacts on stand structure, residual timber stocks and the physical environment.Growth and yield simulation models allow long-term predictions about the response of forests to disturbance from harvesting, information that is essential to determine the effects of different management systems and to establish systems for the regulation or control of timber that are compatible with sustainable forest management. We describe the calibration of a spatially explicit individual tree-based ecological model within the SYMFOR/SIMFLORA framework for forests located near Paragominas in eastern Amazonia. Data originated from an experiment comparing RIL to CL within an area of 73.5 ha monitored over a period of 10 years. We evaluated biological realism and accuracy of the model, concluding that forest dynamics are adequately represented.This model was used to evaluate long-term effects of RIL and CL on the forest. Our results suggest that total and commercial volume recovery following RIL are faster than following CL; it takes 10 and 30-40 years to recover total and commercial volume under RIL while under CL it takes 35-40 and over 60 years, respectively. Despite benefits from RIL, as currently practiced this logging system does not result in long-term sustained timber yields, reinforcing results from previous studies indicating that RIL must be combined with appropriate systems for yield regulation.In the absence of silvicultural treatments, the model suggests that successive RIL harvests at current intensities will produce stands dominated by pioneer species groups, with few trees belonging to the emergent species group, and an increased proportion of defective trees in commercial size classes. These changes in stand composition present challenges to the long-term financial viability of RIL as currently applied in the Amazon region. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A soil compaction diagnosis method for occasional tillage recommendation under continuous no tillage system in Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil compaction has reduced crop yield under continuous no-tillage systems (NTS), and occasional tillage has been suggested as a mitigating measure. The aim of this study was to suggest a moisture content range ideal for diagnosing and monitoring soil compaction and propose a criterion based on PR for making decisions regarding recommendation of occasional tillage. After 10 years of cultivation under NTS, soil management practices were tested for mitigating soil compaction, combining occasional tillage (subsoiling or chisel plowing) and chemical soil conditioning (limestone or agricultural gypsum). Undisturbed soil samples were collected at three depths, and PR was measured at seven soil matric potentials at 1.5 years after the installation of the experiment. Five PR models were tested in accordance with soil moisture content and validated for each treatment and soil depth. The yields of soybean (2015/2016 and 2017/2018 crop seasons), maize (2016/2017 crop season), common bean (2017 second crop), and wheat (2018 second crop) were evaluated. Occasional tillage with subsoiling or chisel plowing under continuous NTS led to an increase in grain yield in the three subsequent years. An ideal range of soil water content for diagnosis of compaction (IRDC) in a continuous NTS area between the matric potentials of -0.03 and -0.50 MPa, preferentially -0.10 MPa, was suggested, unlike the value of field capacity suggested in the literature. Based on the IRDC, a method was proposed for diagnosis and monitoring of soil compaction in continuous NTS areas exhibiting restricted grain yield for the purpose of making decisions regarding occasional tillage. An example of application of this method was tested and was successful.

TI  - Global patterns of tropical forest fragmentation
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing enables the quantification of tropical deforestation with high spatial resolution(1,2). This in-depth mapping has led to substantial advances in the analysis of continent-wide fragmentation of tropical forests(1-4). Here we identified approximately 130 million forest fragments in three continents that show surprisingly similar power-law size and perimeter distributions as well as fractal dimensions. Power-law distributions(5-7) have been observed in many natural phenomena(8,9) such as wildfires, landslides and earthquakes. The principles of percolation theory(7,10,11) provide one explanation for the observed patterns, and suggest that forest fragmentation is close to the critical point of percolation; simulation modelling also supports this hypothesis. The observed patterns emerge not only from random deforestation, which can be described by percolation theory(10,11), but also from a wide range of deforestation and forest-recovery regimes. Our models predict that additional forest loss will result in a large increase in the total number of forest fragments-at maximum by a factor of 33 over 50 years-as well as a decrease in their size, and that these consequences could be partly mitigated by reforestation and forest protection.

TI  - Diversity of hemipterans in Eucalyptus spp. plantations in southeastern para, Eastern Amazon, Brazil.
T2  - Neotropical Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has 10.2 million hectares of reforestation, which account for 81% of the timber produced in the country. The order Hemiptera contains the main phytophagous species. The study of population surveys allows the analysis of faunal composition, resource availability, as well as potential pests in future plantations, contributing to sustainable pest management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of insects of the order Hemiptera in Eucalyptus spp. plantations in southeastern Para, Eastern Amazon. Yellow adhesive traps were used to collect entomofauna, with 12 collections in total, (6) during the dry season and (6) during the rainy season. A total of 28 traps were installed in areas with clones of Eucalyptus urophylla, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urograndis, in three municipalities in Para. The insects collected were analyzed through the faunal indices of abundance,constancy, dominance and frequency, and diversity of Shanon and Pielou. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the families that most influenced the different climatic seasons and in the different clones of Eucalyptus spp. A total of 18.320 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 families. The greatest abundance was observed in the dry season, influencing the seasonality of the families that presented the highest faunal indices. Cicadellidae presented high indices in the three clones, highlighting the clone E. urograndis with the greatest diversity of insects and richness of families, during the dry season, which demonstrates the strong preference of the families for the season and for this species, and indicates a great risk of becoming a potential pest in future commercial plantations, monitoring and preventive actions are recommended to mitigate the impact of these species.

TI  - Sustainable land preparation for farmer-managed lowland agriculture in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In almost all forms of agriculture and farming practice, land clearing is the initial step. In Indonesia, in general, the most cost effective means of clearing land is through the use of fire. However, this use of fire often results in uncontrolled outbreaks, particularly in lowland areas especially and during prolonged dry seasons. In recent years, these uncontrolled fire outbreaks have had a catastrophic environmental, social and economic impact. The Indonesian government has expressed a strong commitment to controlling these outbreaks, as demonstrated by a broad set of laws, regulations, decrees, guidelines, and directives to control and manage land and forest fire. However, despite these measures, the occurrence of widespread, high-intensity fire outbreaks is still unacceptably high. This study assessed land-clearing techniques associated with a low risk of fire outbreaks, comparing the costs associated with a range of these techniques. It then analyzed intervention options that would involve the adoption of these techniques by farmers. These low-risk techniques included: (i) zero-burning practices involving traditional machinery and farmer groups; (ii) zero-burning involving modern machinery and partnerships with government agencies/private enterprises; (iii) controlled burning; and (iv) the chemical removal of biomass using herbicides. The study finds that the costs for all four of these options are higher than with landclearing techniques that use fire alone. However, it also showed that the cost implications for farmers could be mitigated by taking a more holistic view of farming practices as a system, rather than focusing only on landclearing practices in isolation. It found that when land-clearing practices that involve low risks of fire outbreak are combined with good agricultural practices (GAP), farmers could still achieve higher levels of profitability and productivity than under a business as usual (BAU) scenario. The study produced scenarios involving BAU practices; land clearing without fire and with BAU practices; and land clearing without fire and with good agricultural practices (GAP) for four agricultural commodities (oil palm, cocoa, rubber, and paddy). It found that the return on land (NPV) in the case of the scenario involving land clearing without fire and with GAP was still higher than under the BAU scenario, except in the case of rubber, with which the NPV was higher in the scenario with modern machinery and GAP. The study concludes that a systems approach is necessary to effectively control fire outbreaks. Government programs should be designed and implemented on the basis of this systems approach with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including through partnerships with the private sector operators, to effectively control the risk of fire outbreaks while at the same time supporting farmers' livelihoods by ensuring that they are enabled to generate higher levels of productivity and profitability from their land.

TI  - Characteristics, lability and distribution of phosphorus in suspended sediment from a subtropical catchment under diverse anthropic pressure in Southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring lability of anthropogenically enriched sediment-bound phosphorus (P) to water is a useful tool in ecological monitoring and planning mitigation to tackle diffuse P sources to surface waters. In current study, the sediment-associated total P, P fractions, and P lability accounting for river P legacy was determined. We monitored six representative headwater sub-catchments differing in land-use and management i.e., forest, recently turned low agriculture under conventional-tillage (CT), low agriculture under CT dominated with Ilex paraguariensis plantations, intense agriculture under CT, intense agriculture under no-tillage (NT), and highly anthropic urban receiving untreated sewage; and five sites on the main river in Guapore river from October 2012 to October 2014. Total P and individual P fractions in 63-mu m particle size were determined following the Hedley fractionation and the mean TP concentration lied between 752 mg kg-1 in forest to as high as 1738 mg kg(-1) in highly anthropic sediments. The individual P fraction when pooled for different P lability indicated 10, 35, and 55% of TP as labile, moderately labile and non-labile P, respectively. With a land use shift from forest to highly anthropic urban, an increase in labile P (172%), moderately labile P (705%) and non-labile P (874%) was observed. The consistent higher values of non-labile (Pi + PoHID-0.5) and residual P in urban, high agriculture and main river sediment indicates the high P affinity due to the presence of high Fe/Al oxides. Temporal analysis revealed that regardless of P lability, a higher concentration was found in winter months (July to November) particularly under CT sub-catchment showing high sediment production and increased transport of added P during tobacco cultivation period. The results provided a baseline to revisit the current fertilization and soil management practices to minimize the river P legacy for sustainable ecological management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multidimensional forests: Complexity of forest-based values and livelihoods across Amazonian socio-cultural and geopolitical contexts
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the contribution of forests to local livelihoods has so far had a strong focus on quantifying the monetary value of forest-derived products and services. In this paper, we move beyond monetary valuation and integrate the less tangible and sometimes culturally complex dimensions through which forests support local livelihoods. We look at four local contexts in the Brazilian, Bolivian and Ecuadorian Amazon, which differ markedly in terms of their biophysical, sociocultural and geopolitical settings. Combining economic and anthropological data, we used quantitative and qualitative methods, and measures of the ecological impacts of local forest uses. Quantitative analyses drew on datasets from 48 communities, and 510 households, while the qualitative analyses relied on semi-structured interviews with 78 families in 22 communities. Forest-based livelihoods exhibited complex portfolios, diversified produc-tion systems, seasonal variation of activities, and different specialization strategies. Beyond a source of subsistence and cash incomes, forests were locally valued by people across all sites in terms of identities, worldviews, territorial attachment, governance, and conservation. Populations with a longer history of interactions with the environment displayed more complex forest-related cultural systems, but even among people who had migrated into the forest in a more recent historical period, forest-based self -cultural identification was evident. At all sites, forests were unanimously recognized as critical to people's health and wellbeing, despite substantial differences in local histories, policy and market environments. The findings underscore the persistent importance of non-economic values of forests as both Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups constantly adapt their forest and land use practices based on transcultural exchange and changing conditions. A focus on economic value as the rationale for forest conservation disregards the striking resilience of cultural values in promoting forest conservation and use by diverse local and Indigenous communities, especially when supported by favorable policies and markets.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Market-mediated responses confound policies to limit deforestation from oil palm expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for palm oil has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs.

TI  - Incentivizing compliance: Evaluating the effectiveness of targeted village incentives for reducing burning in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic peat and forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan result in haze that blankets Indonesia and neighboring countries, with effects on human health, the environment and the economy. Although the prevailing approach for preventing and reducing the incidence of fire in Indonesia is regulatory, village-level incentive schemes have been trialed by agribusinesses and pulp and paper companies to prevent burning. In this article, we review one integrated incentive program for villages launched by a pulp and paper company in Riau, Sumatra, in 2015. As part of the study, we surveyed six of the villages that participated in the first year of the program as well as six non-program villages, complemented by spatial analyses of hotspots and burn scars. Our analyses show a declining pattern of burning in the years prior and including 2015, followed by the almost total cessation of burning in the years after. During 2015, a severe El Nino event, the program villages experienced 40% fewer fires, while in non-program villages, there were 23% more fires. The main reason cited by the villages was the increased awareness of the regulations in force prior to the program. The information about these laws and regulations had been disseminated to program villages, as well as some of the adjacent non-program villages, prior to the commencement of the incentive program. The transition to non-burning livelihoods was enabled by ongoing changes in the landscape to permanent agricultural crops such as oil palm and rubber, as well as non-farming livelihoods. Although the benefits of the program were valued at the community level, the incentives appeared to function as a pathway for incentivizing compliance with prevailing regulations rather than inducing voluntary behaviors. We argue that the current trend for strict environmental regulations undermines the potential for using voluntary incentives. Consequently, we suggest that future incentive schemes should focus on providing agricultural support to smallholders to enable them to adapt to the strict requirements of the environmental regulations in force.

TI  - An Innovative Slepian Approach to Invert GRACE KBRR for Localized Hydrological Information at the Sub-Basin Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GRACE spherical harmonics are well-adapted for representation of hydrological signals in river drainage basins of large size such as the Amazon or Mississippi basins. However, when one needs to study smaller drainage basins, one comes up against the low spatial resolution of the solutions in spherical harmonics. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach based on Slepian functions which can reduce the energy loss by integrating information in the spatial, spectral and time domains. Another advantage of these regionally-defined functions is the reduction of the problem dimensions compared to the spherical harmonic parameters. This also induces a drastic reduction of the computational time. These Slepian functions are used to invert the GRACE satellite data to restore the water mass fluxes of different hydro-climatologic environments in Africa. We apply them to two African drainage basins chosen for their size of medium scale and their geometric specificities: the Congo river basin with a quasi-isotropic shape and the Nile river basin with an anisotropic and more complex shape. Time series of Slepian coefficients have been estimated from real along-track GRACE geopotential differences for about ten years, and these coefficients are in agreement with both the spherical harmonic solutions provided by the official centers CSR, GFZ, JPL and the GLDAS model used for validation. The Slepian function analysis highlights the water mass variations at sub-basin scales in both basins.

TI  - Can a Non-Native Primate Be a Potential Seed Disperser? A Case Study on Saimiri sciureus in Pernambuco State, Brazil
T2  - FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between native fleshy-fruit plants and introduced fruit consumers contributes to the dynamics of highly fragmented environments. Such interactions can occur through pollination and seed dispersal. Here, we investigated the potential of seed dispersing by a non-native primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), in an urban Atlantic forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Fleshy fruits from non-native plants were preferentially exploited by the squirrel monkeys. We measured 147 seeds (width and length) from 20 of 106 faecal samples. The dispersed seeds were from five plant species (four families). We found a positive correlation between the size of seeds found in faecal samples with their availability in the habitat. Only one seed was found visually damaged after passage through the squirrel monkeys' guts. The defecated seeds were uniformly distributed (variance to mean ratio index) in the home range of squirrel monkeys, and there was a lack of specific latrines (i. e., habitat preference for defecation). Our data provide evidence that non-native S. sciureus may in be (i) acting as a potential seed disperser of native plants in the Atlantic forest fragment, (ii) contributing to the ecological role of native frugivores, and (iii) potentially contributing to the regeneration process of the highly degraded study site.

TI  - Walking on their own legs: unassisted population growth of the agouti Dasyprocta leporina, reintroduced to restore seed dispersal in an Atlantic Forest reserve
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Reintroduction of locally extirpated species is an increasingly popular conservation tool. However, few initiatives focus on the restoration of ecological processes. In addition, many reintroductions fail to conduct post-release monitoring, hampering both assessment of their success and implementation of adaptive management actions. In 2009 a reintroduction effort was initiated to re-establish a population of the red-rumped agouti Dasyprocta leporina, a scatter-hoarding rodent known to be an important disperser of large seeds, with the aim of restoring ecological processes at Tijuca National Park, south-east Brazil. To assess whether this reintroduced population established successfully we monitored it using mark-resighting during November 2013-March 2015. Population size and survival were estimated using a robust design Poisson-log normal mixed-effects mark-resight model. By March 2015 the number of wild-born individuals fluctuated around 30 and overall growth of the population was positive. As the reintroduced population is capable of unassisted growth, we conclude that the reintroduction has been successful in the medium term. We recommend the cessation of releases, with efforts redirected to continued monitoring, investigation and management of possible threats to the species' persistence, and to quantification of the re-establishment of ecological processes. Reintroduction of D. leporina populations can be a cost-effective tool to restore ecological processes, especially seed dispersal, in Neotropical forests.

TI  - Trends in Nighttime Fires in South/Southeast Asian Countries
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying spatial variations and trends in nighttime fires is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of fire dynamics. Traditional fire monitoring typically focuses on daytime observations, but controlling nocturnal fires poses unique challenges due to reduced visibility. While several studies have focused on examining global and regional fire trends, very few studies have focused on nighttime fires, particularly in South/Southeast Asian (S/SEA) countries. In this study, we analyzed nighttime vegetation fires in S/SEA using VIIRS I-band (375 m) data, including a comparison with Sentinel-3A SLSTR data. The results suggested that similar to 28.25% of total fires occurred at night in SA, and 18.98% in SEA. In SA, a statistically significant (p =< 0.05) increase in nighttime fires was observed in Bangladesh. India showed a positive trend in nighttime fires, while Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka exhibited negative trends; however, these results were not statistically significant. In SEA, we detected statistically significant (p =< 0.05) decreases in nighttime fires in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, with increases in Myanmar and the Philippines. Indonesia experienced the most substantial reduction in nighttime fires. Furthermore, VIIRS I-band detections were approximately 92-98 times higher than those of SLSTR-3A in S/SEA. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into nighttime fires and trends in S/SEA countries, which are useful for fire prevention, mitigation and management in the region.

TI  - Bigger is better: Improved nature conservation and economic returns from landscape-level mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact mitigation is a primary mechanism on which countries rely to reduce environmental externalities and balance development with conservation. Mitigation policies are transitioning from traditional project-by-project planning to landscape-level planning. Although this larger-scale approach is expected to provide greater conservation benefits at the lowest cost, empirical justification is still scarce. Using commercial sugarcane expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado as a case study, we apply economic and biophysical steady-state models to quantify the benefits of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC) under landscape-and property-level planning. We find that FC compliance imposes small costs to business but can generate significant long-term benefits to nature: supporting 32 (+/- 37) additional species (largely habitat specialists), storing 593,000 to 2,280,000 additional tons of carbon worth $69 million to $265 million ($pertains to U.S. dollars), and marginally improving surface water quality. Relative to property-level compliance, we find that landscape-level compliance reduces total business costs by $19 million to $35 million per 6-year sugarcane growing cycle while often supporting more species and storing more carbon. Our results demonstrate that landscape-level mitigation provides cost-effective conservation and can be used to promote sustainable development.

TI  - Methodological Contribution to the Assessment of Generation and Sediment Transport in Tropical Hydrographic Systems
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficiency and useful life of reservoirs are directly related to the production and input rates of sediments resulting from erosive processes at the edges and those resulting from the action of surface runoff in contribution areas and transported via tributary channels. Knowledge of the intensity, as well as the relationship between generation and input, allows more precise identification of critical environments, helping in the decision-making process and allowing the definition of mitigating measures. This work aims to relate the spatial variability of soil loss with the respective sediment transfer potential in two sub-basins tributary to the HPP Batalha reservoir in the Midwest region of Brazil. The methodology comprised the bivariate analysis between estimates of soil loss in areas of contribution and the Declivity-Extent Relationship along the channels. The results point to the configuration of four spatial patterns, indicating different levels of criticality in terms of sediment generation potential and transport capacity. In addition, they highlight basins with high potential and greater proximity to the reservoir, which constitute priority areas for monitoring, especially the conditions of soil cover and management, to contribute to the reduction of sediment inputs and prolong the efficiency of these structures.

TI  - An Object Driven Model of Above-Land Merkus Pine Tree for Quantifying the Commercial Contribution With Functional-Structural Plant Modeling
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Merkus Pine tree is awfully prevalent in Indonesia, especially for its role in reforestation efforts. Beyond its academic significance, it carries economic importance for local communities and the nation at large. This study aims to establish an object-oriented model of the Merkus Pine tree, concentrating on its above-ground attributes. This object-oriented model-developing approach is integrated with the functional-structural plant modelling (FSPM) technique. The constructed model, referred to as an object-driven model, has achieved a verification and validation value of 1.00. This model enables the simulation of the Merkus Pine tree's growth and development, encompassing both its physical structure and economic contribution. The simulation outcomes highlight that a single Merkus Pine tree, upon reaching fifteen years of maturity, can yield an economic contribution of approximately IDR 47,980.04. Also, the developed virtual model of the Merkus Pine tree can be operated as a green lab to analyze its growth and development being interconnected to other aspects; e.g. environment, politic, and culture.

TI  - Felids in an agricultural landscape in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
T2  - Cat News
M3  - Article
AB  - We surveyed felids in an agricultural landscape in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from July 2003 to June 2004. A total of 284 km was walked in transects distributed among the following landscape attributes: semi-deciduous native forest fragments, Eucalyptus plantations, sugar-cane plantations and exotic pastures. The diversity and abundance of felid species were evaluated in the mosaic, and we tested possible differences in frequency of occurrence and species richness according to the land use type by using Nested ANOVA. We found a total of five felid species and the analysis showed no differences for both frequency of occurrence and species richness. We also compared the abundance of species found through studies using similar methodology in different areas by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and no differences in abundance were found. Results demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining data about felid abundance even after one year of fieldwork. However, we could confirm the species occurrence in the area, and the similarity found in species abundance in our region and in more conserved areas allows us to say that Neotropical wild felids can survive in agricultural landscapes as long as native forest fragments remain in the area. Current environmental laws should thus be enforced in order to improve forest conservation and to mitigate the possible impacts of agriculture, paper industry, and livestock production on those species.

TI  - Historic emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in Mato Grosso, Brazil: 1) source data uncertainties.
T2  - Carbon balance and management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.RESULTS: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year periods of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by > 20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C ha-1, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of source data uncertainties are essential for REDD+. Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions.

TI  - Early responses of regeneration to weeding and herbicide application to control Guinea-grass in a 20-year-old Atlantic Forest undergoing restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the invasive grasses harming natural ecosystems in Brazil, Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus) has received significant attention due to its high invasive potential and damage it causes to restoration sites. Here, we show the response of seedlings (10 cm to 1 m) and saplings (>1 m) one year after Guinea-grass removal in a 20-year-old restoration site in the Atlantic Forest. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were installed and assigned into three treatments: control, mechanical removal using gas-trimmers, and mechanical removal followed by the application of Roundup Transorb R (glyphosate). Forest canopy and grass cover were also assessed. Guinea-grass was negatively correlated with woody species richness and abundance. Forest canopy cover was positively related to species richness and abundance, and negatively related to Guinea-grass. Treatments applied were successful in controlling the plant invader and did not cause any significant reduction in the total abundance or richness of saplings after one year. For seedlings, however, the abundance and richness of pioneer woody species increased over time with mechanical removal, while the abundance and richness of non-pioneer woody species decreased in plots treated with herbicide. We expect regeneration responses to continue to improve with time. Our results support the use of both herbicide and mechanical removal to reduce Guinea-grass in Atlantic Forest sites undergoing restoration, although the use of herbicide lowers native seedling richness in the short-term, while mechanical removal may be better for small sites, where it is more feasible and less demanding.

TI  - Delimitation of Ecological Corridor Using Technological Tools
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological corridors are effective strategies to address the environmental consequences of forest fragmentation by connecting fragmented areas through various techniques. This study aims to propose the implementation of an ecological corridor in the Itapemirim River basin in Espirito Santo, Brazil. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: delimiting the Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) in the Itapemirim River watershed and comparing land use and land cover within these areas. The MapBiomas platform and Landsat 8 satellite images were utilized to map land use and land cover, while the criteria set by Law No. 12.651 were followed to define the APP boundaries. The calculation of the landscape ecology indices and the identification of the forest fragments with the highest potential for ecological corridor implementation were conducted using the Fuzzy logic. The QGIS 3.26 application, along with the LecoS 3.0.1 plugin and Fragstats 4.2, were employed to characterize and quantify landscape ecology indices. The costs assessment and determination of the optimal route for implementing the ecological corridor were performed, considering bothdistance and physical impediments. The least cost path algorithm was utilized, taking into account land use and land cover, APP, fragment potential, slope, and subnormal clusters. Evaluating land costs and expropriation expenses required to define the ecological corridor in the study area. The identified forest fragments for inclusion in the ecological corridor were the Caparao National Park, the Serra das Torres State Natural Monument, and other selected fragments based on the application of Fuzzy logic to landscape ecology indices. The corridor route was determined using the least cost path algorithm, considering various factors. This study revealed that the predominant land use and land cover class in the area is pasture, and a significant portion (68.58%) of the designated Permanent Preservation Areas were in conflict with legal regulations. The bare land value per hectare for pasture was the second highest among the land use and land cover categories, accounting for 64.28% of the total. The priority area analysis indicated that 31.86% of the region had high or very high importance for forest restoration, while 42.97% had low or very low priority. The findings demonstrate that the least cost path algorithm, coupled with a multi-criteria decision-making approach using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), is a valuable tool for planning and implementing ecological networks. These methods effectively consider critical factors in decision-making processes related to the optimal location of the ecological corridor. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the implementation of an ecological corridor in the Itapemirim River basin, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors and utilizing appropriate methodologies for effective decision-making in ecological planning.

TI  - Effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tropical forestry
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of organic wastes tends to increase in a manner that is proportional to human population growth. Currently, applying these wastes to soils is being considered as an alternative solution for the over production of organic waste. However, the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic waste applications in tropical forestry are unknown. The aim of the present study was to quantify soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from a reforestation project, where trees (Calophyllum brasiliense) were fertilized with different mineral and organic waste materials. A randomized trial was established to measure soil GHG emissions from plots fertilized with sewage sludge compost (SSC), sewage sludge (SS), mineral fertilizer (Min Fert) and a control (C). C brasiliense seedling spaced in 3 m x 2 m intervals were place into a planting hole which had fertilizer incorporated for seedling establishment. Soil GHG were measured using the static chamber method, placing chambers on the surface of the soil and taking measurements over time, during 172 days in a dry season. Organic wastes (SS and SSC treatments) had significantly higher soil CO2 fluxes than mineral fertilizer and control plots, with soil CO2 fluxes of 6.35 +/- 1.17 and 9.33 +/- 0.96 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The application of organic wastes promoted a drastic increase in soil N2O emissions treated with SSC (141.19 mg +/- 21 N m(-2) day(-1), p < 0.01), which had a higher emission factor (2.11%). Average soil CH4 flux on collection days was 0.1 +/- 0.2 mg C m(-2) day(-1), although cumulative soil CH4 emissions over the 5 months study period was positive for the SS treatment, demonstrating the potential emission of GHG from this treatment. Apparently, the variation in fluxes between treatments with organic residues was influenced by differences in the physical and chemical compositions of the wastes and the amounts of labile carbon added.

TI  - Sustainable aviation fuels must control induced land use change: an integrated assessment modelling exercise for Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bio-sustainable aviation fuels (bio-SAFs) are an important pillar of the aviation sector decarbonisation strategy in the mid-term. Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of -286.8 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions.

TI  - No-till agriculture and the deception of sustainability in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agronomists and policy makers have proposed no-tillage practice and advocacy in the tropical savannah (Cerrado) of Brazil as a model for agriculture elsewhere. Building from intensive research with Embrapa and ethnographic research with two communities of transnational soy farmers, this paper explores the origins of no-tillage farming in the state of Parana and the adoption and exploitation of no-tillage by large-scale farmers in the Cerrado of Brazil's center-west. The spread of no-till was made possible by farmer innovation in Parana, scientific research adapting the practice to the tropics, and and heavy application of chemical herbicides to control weeds without manual cultivation and intense soil fertility amendments in order to make the Cerrado productive for industrial agriculture. Small-scale Mennonites in the state of Goias adopted it as an emergency measure to save their land base and compete with neighboring Brazilian farmers; large-scale family farmers from the U.S. adopted no-till to save on labor expense and reduce their liability in the face of labor laws. This indicates that while no-till in Brazil reduces soil erosion and is not a problem in itself, it emerges from a context of socio-technical fixes and its implementation supports farm profitability and agricultural expansion in the Cerrado.

TI  - Long-term effects of sugarcane monoculture on soil pedomorphology and physicochemical properties in tropical agroecosystems
T2  - PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the impact of prolonged sugarcane cultivation on the pedo-morphological characteristics and physicochemical properties of three soil types: Entisols, Inceptisols, and Vertisols, as a basis for determining the improvement step ensuring the sustainability of sugarcane production in Indonesia. Soil samples were collected from fields of sugarcane cultivated for 10, 20, and 30 years to analyse pedo-morphological and physicochemical properties. The results indicate that while Entisols and Inceptisols exhibited significant changes in soil properties with increasing cultivation duration, the pedo-morphology of Vertisols remained relatively stable. All soil types developed Ap horizons due to sugarcane cultivation, with anthropogenic practices leading to more dynamic changes in surface horizons. Extended cultivation reduced soil organic matter, N-total, and available nitrogen, while phosphorus and exchangeable cation availability were influenced by mineral composition. Notably, cation exchange capacity (CEC) decreased in Entisols and Inceptisols but increased in Vertisols. For productivity, Vertisols demonstrated the most stable and highest sugarcane productivity with long-term monoculture cultivation. There is a need for tailored sustainable soil management across different soil types and practices to mitigate soil degradation and maintain nutrient availability to ensure the sustainability of sugarcane production in Indonesia.

TI  - Conflict between human and wild Sumatran Elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus Temminck, 1847) in Aceh Province, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Aceh Province has the largest habitat for Sumatran elephant. However, the elephant population in the province keeps decreasing due to frequent conflict with humans. This study aimed to observe the trend and pattern of Human-elephant Conflict (HEC) in Aceh, as well as the main causes driving the conflict. To collect information, we carried out desk study, secondary data collection, and interviews with relevant actors in Aceh Jaya, Pidie, and Aceh Timur District. We collected data of HEC during the 2012-2017 period in 16 districts across Aceh. The result shows that during the six years, there were 262 HEC cases occurred in Aceh, where Aceh Timur and Aceh Jaya contributed the highest number of HEC incidence, with 47 and 44 cases respectively. Maximum Entropy analysis shows that the main factor causing the conflict is "Distance from the human settlement" with 84.7% contribution, followed by "Primary forest loss" (14.1% contribution). From the findings, we suggest reforestation in areas that becomes elephant home range and creation of barriers within the conservation forest boundaries. Moreover, HEC mitigation action should also be incorporated in provincial spatial planning (Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah - Provinsi) to minimize further economic loss and wildlife extinction.

TI  - Improving reintroduction planning and implementation through quantitative SWOT analysis
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades have seen increasing use and importance of translocations and reintroductions as tools for species' conservation and ecological restorations. Most such efforts face substantial logistical complexities and high costs, both biological and financial. These and other challenges have contributed to numerous failures or partial successes of reintroductions, a trend which has improved little over time. Given the negative ramifications of reintroduction failures, practitioners have adopted or developed numerous analytical and procedural methods in efforts to promote successful outcomes. However, many such methods are often ad hoc or taxon-specific, particularly regarding the evaluation and selection of reintroduction areas and sites. Despite the recognized importance of this phase of reintroduction planning, there is to date no comprehensive methodology for selecting suitable reintroduction sites. We describe in detail the application of quantitative SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for objectively evaluating candidate reintroduction areas or sites, and how results of this analysis are used for identifying the most effective and efficient management actions for promoting reintroduction success. We use examples drawn from recent reintroduction plans for three avian species in Puerto Rico (1) and Brazil (2) to illustrate specific methodologies used as well as the results obtained and their application to the reintroduction planning and implementation process. From our findings, quantitative SWOT analysis is a simple, versatile, repeatable and intuitive method for reintroduction area and site selection. The method also provides a valuable mechanism for evaluating and prioritizing management actions relative to their efficiency and effectiveness for achieving reintroduction objectives.

TI  - Fire as an economic disincentive to smallholder rubber planting in Imperata areas of Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - A fire dimension was incorporated into an existing bioeconomic spreadsheet model of a smallholder rubber agroforestry system, with Imperata as the understorey to rubber. The augmented model was then used to trace the physical and economic consequences of fire. Imperata is regarded as providing the fire fuel load in the model, either as the rubber understorey, or as separate grassland. The risk of fire was demonstrated to be an economic disincentive to rubber growing in Imperata areas. Even a modest fire risk of 10% per year considerably reduced expected profit from rubber growing. In addition to these private costs imposed by the risk of fire, there are 'social' costs resulting from fire spreading across farm boundaries. If one farmer reduces the understorey Imperata fuel load (eg. via tree planting), fire risk is reduced for all neighbouring farmers. In this sense, fire risk can be regarded as an 'environmental externality' comparable to herbicide drift. There are also broader environmental issues emanating from fire risk in Imperata grassland areas. These include significant respiratory and other problems associated with smoke haze. These various externalities imply that some of the responsibility for fire control appropriately rests with communities, or governments as their representatives, rather than solely with individuals. An empirical example of the benefits from community action, through a coordinated approach to rubber planting, is presented, based upon the modelling work. The data availability for building the fire component of the model was quite limited. Farm survey work was carried out in 1995 and 1996 in an attempt to gain an increased understanding of the nature and importance of fires in Imperata grassland for smallholder rubber producers. This provided some general guidance, and allowed inferences to be made about some parameter values. Other values were obtained form expert opinion. Recognition of the importance of grassland and forest fires in Indonesia implies that there will be more relevant research output forthcoming. Conceptualisation of an economic framework within which some types of fire research can be evaluated is regarded as a key output of the current work. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Rescue tree monocultures! A phylogenetic ecology approach to guide the choice of seedlings for enrichment planting in tropical monoculture plantations
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monoculture tree plantations have been preferred by farmers and companies because they maximize the production of specific products and are easier to manage, while multispecies plantations can provide multiple ecosystem services but have still been adopted at very limited scales. One potential midway to enhance the ecological contribution of monoculture plantations is to introduce native tree species in the plantation understory. We conducted phylogenetically explicit enrichment planting experiments beneath the monocultures of two tree species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess if the evolutionary distance of each seedling species to the overstory tree explained variations in seedling performance. We planted in the understory of two replicate plantations of species Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae; 38 and 25 years old) and Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell) (Bignoniaceae; both replicates were 30 years old) six native tree species, ranging in their evolutionary distances to these overstory species. We assessed individual seedling survival and height at 1, 7, and 19 months after planting. We found a weak yet significant, positive correlation between seedling performance (growth and survival) and the phylogenetic distance of the planted seedling to the overstory species, which was driven by the poor performance of conspecifics. Seedlings of the same order and class as the overstory trees showed a significantly lower risk of death compared to conspecifics and to the furthest relative, Cryptocarya aschersoniana. These findings highlight that very close relatives to the overstories should be avoided when planting beneath monoculture plantations, but that knowledge on species-specific requirements is still the most important for a successful planting.

TI  - Time since fire as a driver of taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns of grassland plant communities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire plays a key role in grasslands, determining the distribution and evolution of species and boundaries with neighboring ecosystems. Evidence of community-wide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors, while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked. Here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire (TSF) gradient. We sampled 12 communities in Southern Brazil under varying TSF and calculated taxonomic species richness (S) and dominance (D), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and mean phylogenetic distances (MPD). We used Structural Equation Models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors. Communities with longer TSF presented higher PD and MPD but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance. These sites were dominated by monocots, specifically C4 grasses, but also presented exclusive clades, whereas recently-burned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades. Our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management. Fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical non-forest ecosystems from South America respond differently to fire, possibly due to different evolutionary histories.

TI  - Corn root and soil health indicator response to no-till production practices
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production guidelines in Brazil currently focus on soil fertility or chemical indicators (i.e., soil pH and nutrient availability) but often neglect physical and biological aspects of soil health. No-tillage (NT) practices have been widely adopted in Brazil primarily to mitigate erosion, but chemical-based guidelines associated with those practices may be contributing to nutrient stratification and a concentration of crop roots within the top few centimeters of the soil profile. Our objective was to quantify relationships between soil physical and chemical attributes and root growth in soils with a long-term NT history (> 10-yr). Crop root development and several soil health indicators were measured within the 0 to 7-, 7- to 17- and 20- to 30-cm depth increments of two long-term NT studies on Rhodic Hapludox soils in Brazil. Data from both experiments showed strong organic carbon (OC) stratification, significant differences in soil physical and chemical attributes, and root systems that were concentrated within the surface layer. Soil compaction below 7-cm appeared to be the dominant factor limiting root growth. Soil-test phosphorus (P) and OC were also correlated to root growth. Based on these analyses and other on-farm observations, we concluded that it is important to recognize that despite its benefits, NT practices can result in plant root stratification. Therefore, it is important to not only monitor soil fertility/chemical conditions, but also soil structure and biological indicators of soil health when developing NT guidelines for Brazil.

TI  - The diversity of post-fire regeneration strategies in the cerrado ground layer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling species strategies that confer resilience to natural disturbances is key to conserving and restoring savanna ecosystems. Fire is a recurrent disturbance in savannas, and savanna vegetation is highly adapted to and often dependent on fire. However, although the woody component of tropical savannas is well studied, we still do not understand how ground-layer plant communities respond to fire, limiting conservation and management actions. We investigated the effects of prescribed fire on community structure and composition, and evaluated which traits are involved in plant community regeneration after fire in the cerrado ground layer. We assessed traits related to species persistence and colonization capacity after fire, including resprouter type, underground structure, fire-induced flowering, regeneration strategy and growth form. We searched for functional groups related to response to fire, to shed light on the main strategies of post-fire recovery among species in the ground layer. Fire changed ground-layer community structure and composition in the short term, leading to greater plant species richness, population densities and increasing bare soil, compared with unburned communities. Eight months after fire, species abundance did not differ from pre-disturbance values for 86% of the species, demonstrating the resilience of this layer to fire. Only one ruderal species was disadvantaged by fire and 13% of the species benefited. Rapid recovery of soil cover by native vegetation in burned areas was driven by species with high capacity to resprout and spread vegetatively. Recovery of the savanna ground-layer community, as a whole, resulted from a combination of different species traits. We summarized these traits into five large groups, encompassing key strategies involved in ground-layer regeneration after fire. Synthesis. Fire dramatically changes the ground layer of savanna vegetation in the short term, but the system is highly resilient, quickly recovering the pre-fire state. Recovery involves different strategies, which we categorized into five functional groups of plant species:grasses,seeders,bloomers,undergroundersandresprouters. Knowledge of these diverse strategies should be used as a tool to assess conservation and restoration status of fire-resilient ecosystems in the cerrado.

TI  - Floristic composition and edaphic relationships in ferruginous campo rupestre reference ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change and occupation have led to modifications in the environment causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the planet. Some environments with high economic relevance, such as the ferruginous campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland known as Canga in Brazil), are even more susceptible to severe impacts due to their extreme habitat conditions and low resilience. The determination of reference ecosystems based on the intrinsic characteristics of the ecosystem is essential for conservation as well as to the implementation of ecological restoration. We proposed the reference ecosystem of the three main types of habitats of the ferruginous campo rupestre based on their floristic composition. We described the floristic composition of each habitat and evaluated the physicochemical properties of the soils and the relationship between plants and soils. All three habitats showed high diversity of plant species and many endemic species, such as Chamaecrista choriophylla, , Cuphea pseudovaccinium, , Lychnophora pinaster, , and Vellozia subalata. . The distribution of vegetation was strongly related with the edaphic characteristics, with a set of species more adapted to high concentration of base saturation, fine sand, organic carbon, and iron, while another set of species succeeded in more acidic soils with higher S and silt concentration. We provide support for the contention that the ferruginous campo rupestre is a mosaic of different habitats shaped by intrinsic local conditions. Failure to recognize the floristic composition of each particular habitat can lead to inappropriate restoration, increased habitat homogenization and increased loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study also advances the knowledge base for building the reference ecosystem for the different types of ferruginous campo rupestre habitats, as well as a key database for highlighting those species contribute most to community assembly in this diverse and threatened tropical mountain ecosystem.

TI  - An ensemble of spatially explicit land-cover model projections: prospects and challenges to retrospectively evaluate deforestation policy
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble techniques, common in many disciplines, have yet to be fully exploited with spatially explicit projections from land-change models. We trial a land-change model ensemble to assess the impact of policies designed to conserve tropical rainforest at the municipality scale in Brazil, noting the achievements made and challenges ahead. Four spatial model frameworks that were calibrated with the same predictor variables produced 21 counterfactual simulations of the actual landscape. Individual projections with a uniform calibration period gave estimates that between 29 and 68% of the simulated deforestation was saved, but lacked an uncertainty estimate, whilst batch projections from two different model frameworks provided a more dependable mean estimate that 38 and 49% deforestation was prevented with an uncertainty range of 1900 and 1000 km(2). The consensus ensembles used agreement between the projections and found that the seven examples with a uniform calibration period produced an error margin of +/- 435.94 km(2) and a prevented forest loss estimate of 50%. Using all 21 projections with diverse calibration periods improved these errors to +/- 179.26 km(2) with a 53% estimate of prevented forest loss. Whilst we achieved a method of combining projections of different frameworks to reduce uncertainty of individual modelling frameworks, demonstrating a control model and accounting for non-linear conditions are challenges that will provide better confidence in this method as an operational tool. Such retrospective evidence could be used to make timely rewards for efforts of governments and municipalities to support tropical forest conservation and help mitigate deforestation.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of Drosophila (Hexapoda, Diptera) in post-mining sites under different forest restoration techniques in the Brazilian Amazon.
T2  - Restoration Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas-Para, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years).

TI  - Nocturnal Bees as Crop Pollinators
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Bees are typically diurnal but around 1% of described species have nocturnal activity. Nocturnal bees are still poorly studied due to bias towards studying diurnal insects. However, knowledge concerning their biology and role as crop pollinators has increased. We review the literature on nocturnal bees' traits and their host plants, and assess the crop pollination effectiveness of this neglected group. Nocturnal bees have visual adaptations to cope with low light intensities, and floral scents are a key sensory cue used to find their host flowers. Nocturnal bees generally show high flower constancy, the ability to vibrate flowers, and high transfer rates of pollen grains to stigmas. The flowers visited by nocturnal bees range from small radial and zygomorphic flowers to large brush blossoms; moreover, they visit plants with different flowering strategies. Nocturnal bees are effective pollinators of regional fruit crops in Brazil, such as cambuci (Campomanesia phaea), guarana (Paullinia cupana), caja (Spondias mombin), and in North America of cultivated pumpkins (Cucurbita species). However, they most likely are pollinators of several other crops. Strategies to host high numbers of nocturnal bees around cropping areas should be taken, such as preserving adjacent native forests, restricting soil management, providing food resources beyond crop flowers, and avoiding light pollution.

TI  - Evaluation of Soil Management and Use in an Ultisol in a Guava Orchard in Comparison with a Sugarcane Field and Native Forest Area
T2  - III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON GUAVA AND OTHER MYRTACEAE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Guava and other Myrtaceae
CL  - Petrolina, BRAZIL
AB  - Studies to find out alternative inputs are important for sustainable agriculture. In this respect, the use of byproducts from guava processing can partially replace the requirements of mineral fertilizer and add organic matter to the soil, increased water retention capacity and mitigating the effects of traffic on the soil. The aim of the present study was to assess the physical aspects of the soil in function of fertilization of guava trees with organic and mineral fertilizers and to compare the results with those found in areas of sugarcane and native forest. The soil samples were obtained from a commercial guava orchard planted with the 'Paluma' (8 years) and 'Pedro Sato' (5 years) cultivars, vegetatively propagated, as well as from a cane field (5 years) and native forest for comparison. The results revealed that the soil moisture, density and penetration resistance varied between the different uses and fertilization regimes. The volumetric moisture and density in the areas cultivated with 'Paluma' guava trees were similar to those of the native forest. The soil moisture was greater in the rows of the guava trees and the density and penetration resistance were greater in the traffic paths.

TI  - Management Recommendation Generation for Areas Under Forest Restoration Process through Images Obtained by UAV and LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was weed control + plant seedlings (34%) for all evaluated methods. The image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient, mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations.

TI  - Effect of tree planting design and tree species on human thermal comfort in the tropics
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees behave in different ways on microclimate due to mainly distinct features of each species and planting strategies especially in the tropics. This paper quantifies the daily and seasonal microclimate behavior of various tree species with different planting design either individual or in clusters. This specific knowledge is an important step in the development of urban design guidelines based on the shading of trees and climate adaptation in urban areas in the tropics. It focuses on human thermal comfort based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) for different species. Twelve species were analyzed: Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex A.DC.) Mattos, Jacaranda mimosaefolia D. Don., Syzygium cumini L, Mangifera indica L, Pinus palustris L, Pinus coulteri L.; Lafoensia glyptocarpa L, Caesalpinia pluviosa F., Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv., Tipuana tipu F., Delonix indica F. and Senna siamea L. The results show that shading of trees can influence significantly human thermal comfort expressed by (PET). The species C. pluviosa F. presents the best possibility in terms of PET because it can reduce between 12 and 16 C for individual trees cluster can reduce between 12.5 and 14.5 degrees C. Appropriate vegetation used for shading public and private areas is essential to mitigate heat stress and can create better human thermal comfort especially in cities. The results can be seen as a possibility of improvement of outdoor thermal comfort conditions and as an important step in order to achieve sustainability in cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Characteristics and causes of natural and human-induced landslides in a tropical mountainous region: the rift flank west of Lake Kivu (Democratic Republic of the Congo)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical mountainous regions are often identified as landslide hotspots with growing population pressure. Anthropogenic factors are assumed to play a role in the occurrence of landslides in these densely populated regions, yet the relative importance of these human-induced factors remains poorly documented. In this work, we aim to explore the impact of forest cover dynamics, roads and mining activities on the characteristics and causes of landslides in the rift flank west of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). To do so, we compile a comprehensive multi-temporal inventory of 2730 landslides. The landslides are of different types and are grouped into five categories that are adapted to study the impact of human activities on slope stability: old (pre-1950s) and recent (post-1950s) deep-seated landslides, shallow landslides, landslides associated with mining and landslides associated with road construction. We analyse the landslides according to this classification protocol via frequency-area statistics, frequency ratio distribution and logistic regression susceptibility assessment. We find that natural factors contributing to the cause of recent and old deep-seated landslides were either different or changed over time. Under similar topographic conditions, shallow landslides are more frequent, but of a smaller size, in areas where deforestation has occurred since the 1950s. We attribute this size reduction to the decrease in regolith cohesion due to forest loss, which allows for a smaller minimum critical area for landsliding. In areas that were already deforested in the 1950s, shallow landslides are less frequent, larger and occur on less steep slopes. This suggests a combined role between regolith availability and soil management practices that influence erosion and water infiltration. Mining activities increase the odds of landsliding. Landslides associated with mining and roads are larger than shallow landslides but smaller than the recent deep-seated instabilities, and they are controlled by environmental factors that are not present under natural conditions. Our analysis demonstrates the role of human activities on the occurrence of landslides in the Lake Kivu region. Overall, it highlights the need to consider this context when studying hillslope instability characteristics and distribution patterns in regions under anthropogenic pressure. Our work also highlights the importance of using landslide classification criteria adapted to the context of the Anthropocene.

TI  - Comparing the potential reproductive phenology between restored areas and native tropical forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is rarely considered when selecting species used in restoration actions. However, considering the potential flowering and fruiting phenologies of species is a key point to: (1) evaluate the capacity of restoration actions in reestablishing ecological interactions (pollination and seed dispersal) and ecosystem functions (early germination and plant establishment to reduce soil erosion); (2) determine which species are most suitable to the target site, and (3) identify when and where locally adapted seeds can be harvested and purchased. Here, we evaluate the potential reproductive phenology of species occurring in restored and forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil. We asked whether flowering and fruiting phenological patterns differed among type areas. For such, we compared 14 restored areas and 18 nearby forest fragments and compiled phenological data from the literature for 267 species (84% of species sampled). Despite their low floristic similarity, restored and forest fragments showed close similarity of general potential flowering and fruiting periods year-round, peaking in the dry-to-rainy season. There were only slight differences in seasonality of two out of the eight parameters evaluated. Nonzoochorous species' fruiting was seasonal, while zoochorous species fruiting onset occurred year-round but was slightly seasonal in forest fragments. Comparing potential phenological patterns between restored and forest fragments using a compilation from secondary sources are unprecedented in Brazil at this scale. Our results highlight that applying phenological information, even from literature, is essential to improve the science and practice of future restoration actions, enhancing the likelihood of successful restoration of ecosystem functions and species interactions.

TI  - Farmers' Visions on Soils: A Case Study among Agroecological and Conventional Smallholders in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Why do farmers not take better care of their soils? This article aims to give insight into how farmers look at soil quality management.Design/methodology/approach: It analyses diverse land management practices and visions on soils and soil quality of ten agroecological and 14 conventional smallholder farmers in Araponga, Minas Gerais, Brazil. As agroecological farming (that is, managing soils with minimum use of external inputs) requires more complex knowledge, it is assumed that agroecological farmers would be more knowledgeable on soils compared to conventional farmers. This case study tests the hypothesis that differences in land management practices between agroecological and conventional farmers can be explained by differences in their knowledge on soils.Findings: The hypothesis turned out to be faulty: agroecological and conventional farmers do not differ in what they know about soils, but how they use their knowledge in their farming strategy. Both groups of farmers have different but rational farming strategies.Practical implications: Designing policies and measures to make farming more environmentally friendly and more sustainable as two-way knowledge exchange between farmers and science (and not as one-way knowledge transfer from science to farmers), to benefit from vital and contextbased farmers' knowledge and to ensure successful implementation of more sustainable land management practices.Originality/value: By analysing farmers' visions on soil quality management and farming strategies, this study shows that farmers' knowledge is valuable for farmers, for scientific knowledge on soil quality management and for policies which are to be effective and adapted to the local environment.

TI  - Assessing soil mechanical resistance at different depths and compactation mapping at effective root zone
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil compaction, a result of mechanical resistance to penetration, has a direct impact on yield potential by limiting root access to water and nutrients. Factors such as inadequate crop rotation, intensive mechanization, and trampling by animals contribute to compaction. Mitigation strategies include crop rotation, control of machinery traffic, the use of cover crops, and the use of mechanical techniques. Geostatistical methods in pedostatistics evaluate the spatial variability of soil properties. The aim of this study was to determine the penetration resistance in five soil layers (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm), identify critical compaction regions, and quantify the economic impact of compaction management in a 230 ha farm in Alegrete, Brazil. A digital penetrometer was used to measure resistance and semivariograms were calculated using classical and robust estimators for interpolation. The evaluation of the economic impact took into account the variable cost differences between the total area and the area required for compaction. The analysis showed a gradual increase in compaction from the surface to the subsoil, with a highly compacted zone occurring at 20-30 cm, signaling the need for monitoring and intervention. The dependency analysis showed a well-defined structure. The results show that geostatistical tools can be used in the assessment of soil penetration resistance, especially in layers from 10 to 20 cm. An efficient identification and quantification of compacted zones within the cultivation area was achieved. This approach proves to be economically viable, especially in extensive farming, suggesting a wide application in agricultural compaction management.

TI  - Wildfires Jeopardise Habitats of Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), a Flagship Species for the Conservation of the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in fire regimes can increase extinction risk of species with distribution restricted to fire-prone habitats. The extent of the area burnt in the Brazilian Pantanal reached a record high in 2020, resulting in an environmental catastrophe. This globally important wetland is the main area of occurrence of the Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). Distribution modelling suggests that the macaw occupies areas, where its major food sources, the palms Attalea phalerata and Acrocomia aculeata are present and Sterculia apetala provides nesting hollows. To estimate the proportion of suitable habitat lost to fire over the years, we overlaid modelled distributions of the macaw and two plant species (Attalea phalerata and Sterculia apetala) with the extent of area burnt in the Pantanal in 2003-2020. We estimated the phenological predictability of the two food plants and evaluated the consequences of fire on the availability of these resources. Considering historical fire recurrence data, Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, Sterculia apetala, and Attalea phalerata are predominantly present in areas with no or low annual fire occurrence. We found that over 25% of Hyacinth Macaw habitat had been affected by fire in 2020, which is about five times higher than the historical annual average. The length and seasonality of the fire season was confirmed by circular statistics, suggesting that the number of large fires increased in 2020 compared to the historical series. Consequently, in the catastrophic season of 2020, wildfires were much more extensive and occurred earlier in the year. We did not detect significant correlation between food availability and historical fire seasonality. Hence, it difficult to predict how changes in the temporal pattern of fires may affect resource availability for the macaw. Moreover, the macaw's peak egg laying occurs in August and nestlings hatch around September, and habitat loss resulting from megafires can compromise the conservation of even large, flying species. This justifies adaptive fire management as an important conservation action to preserve suitable habitat for the Hyacinth Macaw.

TI  - Regeneration after fire in campo rupestre: Short- and long-term vegetation dynamics
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering 22% of the country, and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem. Campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems, composed of a mosaic of herbaceous, shrubland and savanna vegetation, generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow, acidic and nutrient-poor soils. In the context of increased land-use changes, effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems. Although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre, the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short- and long-term in the main herbaceous vegetation types: the sandy and stony grasslands. We monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short- term vegetation recovery. Diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the long-term vegetation dynamics. Our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires, suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities. We did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire, whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands. No change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted, probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem. After fire, biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types. High biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity.

TI  - Ghg mitigation potential and cost in tropical forestry - Relative role for agroforestry
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes studies of carbon mitigation potential (MP) and costs of forestry options in seven developing countries with a focus on the role of agroforestry. A common methodological approach known as comprehensive mitigation assessment process (COMAP) was used in each study to estimate the potential and costs between 2000 and 2030. The approach requires the projection of baseline and mitigation land-use scenarios derived from the demand for forest products and forestland for other uses such as agriculture and pasture. By using data on estimated carbon sequestration, emission avoidance, costs and benefits, the model enables one to estimate cost effectiveness indicators based on monetary benefit pert C, as well as estimates of total mitigation costs and potential when the activities are implemented at equilibrium level. The results show that about half the MP of 6.9 Gt C (an average of 223 Mt C per year) between 2000 and 2030 in the seven countries could be achieved at a negative cost, and the other half at costs not exceeding dollar sign100 pert C. Negative cost indicates that non-carbon revenue is sufficient to offset direct costs of about half of the options. The agroforestry options analyzed bear a significant proportion of the potential at medium to low cost pert C when compared to other options. The role of agroforestry in these countries varied between 6% and 21% of the MP, though the options are much more cost effective than most due to the low wage or opportunity cost of rural labor. Agroforestry options are attractive due to the large number of people and potential area currently engaged in agriculture, but they pose unique challenges for carbon and cost accounting due to the dispersed nature of agricultural activities in the tropics, as well as specific difficulties arising from requirements for monitoring, verification, leakage assessment and the establishment of credible baselines.

T2  - Ornithology Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Territorial behaviour, while widespread among birds, remains poorly studied in tropical regions. Here, we investigated the territorial behaviour of the Vulnerable ochre-breasted pipit Anthus nattereri in the Upper Rio Grande Grasslands, state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Through a year-round monitoring of both ringed and non-ringed birds (which were individually identified by song features), we found that the species exhibits a seasonal territorial strategy. During the late dry season and the first half of the wet season, coinciding with the species' breeding period, individuals defend territories primarily through aerial displays. Mean territory size based on the 95% kernel isopleth was 2.04 hectares (ranging from 0.46 to 5.26 hectares), while mean territory size based on the 80% kernel isopleth was 1.18 hectares (0.28-2.77 hectares). Overlap between neighbouring territories were frequent but small and restricted to the territory borders, with agonistic encounters being relatively rare, especially between neighbours ("dear enemy" relationship). Territories were predominantly located on hilltops and/or smooth slopes covered by native grasslands, with few or no shrubs, always on well-drained soils. The species primarily occupied grassland patches ranging from early to intermediate stages of post-fire regeneration. Wildfires only disrupted territories that have been completely burned, with birds that inhabited partially burned areas staying in their territories. Ochre-breasted pipits appear to be well adapted to living in different post-fire regeneration age, and the potential benefits of controlled burning practices for enhancing landscape heterogeneity warrant further investigation.

TI  - Erosion and soil and water conservation inSouth-Kivu(eastern DR Congo): The farmers' view
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being one of the hotspots for soil erosion in the world, little is known regarding farmer's knowledge of soil erosion in the highlands of South-Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A proper understanding of farmers' knowledge regarding soil erosion and conservation measures is a prerequisite for implementing resilient erosion control measures. The objective of this study was therefore to assess farmers' knowledge of soil erosion, to document existing soil and water conservation (SWC) measures and to identify their adoption constraints in the highlands of South-Kivu. Data were collected using interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire involving 720 respondents from eight watersheds in four territories. Farmers reported eight main erosion indicators. As opposed to gullies (80% of farmers), rills were perceived as important erosion indicators by only 50% of farmers, despite their common occurrence. Farmers were largely unaware of the potential impact of their crops and cropping practices on erosion. Farmers knew about only a limited range of SWC measures, which were perceived to be little to moderately efficient. Furthermore, the average level of adoption was very low (21%). Adoption constraints varied widely depending on the SWC measure. Thus, future interventions need to place much greater emphasis on awareness regarding soil erosion and SWC measures, to strengthen farmers' capacity for experimentation and adaptation to new technologies and finally to create a policy and institutional environment that stimulates widespread adoption of SWC techniques.

TI  - The Effect of Climatic Conditions on the Seasonality of Pest Insect Populations in Eucalyptus Plantations in the Neotropics
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp., Mirtaceae) stands out for its remarkable regeneration capacity, making it a valuable tool for recovering degraded areas and for reforestation. Despite its Australian origins, eucalyptus has shown remarkable adaptation to the Brazilian tropical climate, contributing to the wood productivity of the country. However, the extensive monoculture of eucalyptus can increase pest incidence, thus being a significant challenge for the forestry sector, which suffers production losses of up to 30%. We analyzed the occurrence of 11 pest insect species in 450 eucalyptus stands over 9 years in the southeastern region of Brazil in our study. We related pest occurrences to specific year periods and climatic variations using circular uniformity analysis and zero-inflated models. We found that the species generally had isolated peaks of occurrence during the year and that the increase in the occurrence of at least five species was related to temperature or precipitation. The results highlight the sensitivity of pests to climatic conditions, showing the importance of management strategies to ensure the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations. We can develop more effective management strategies by understanding how these variables interact with insect populations, contributing to the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations with less aggressive environmental practices.

TI  - RHIZOBACTERIA INCREASE THE GROWTH AND QUALITY OF Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos SEEDLINGS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos, popularly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a native tree of Brazil with exuberant flowering. It is used for urban afforestation and reforestation of degraded areas, and its wood is destined for several purposes. In order to develop vigorous plants after planting, it is essential to produce high-quality seedlings, which can be obtained using rhizobacteria. As renewable sources, rhizobacteria exhibit growth- promoting properties, facilitate nutrient uptake and/or solubilization, and contributes to the production of phytohormones, while also serving as pathogen controllers and mitigators of abiotic stress. These attributes collectively enable the establishment of a sustainable production system for producing vigorous and rapidly growing seedlings. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the production of H. chrysotrichus seedlings. The experimental design followed a completely randomized setup. The treatments consisted of microorganisms ( Bacillus subtilis, , Bacillus megaterium, , Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, , and Azospirillum brasilense) ) plus the absence of microorganisms- control; four repetitions and ten plants-per-plot. The parameters evaluated were shoot height; stem diameter; root length; shoot, root, and total dry matter; leaf number and leaf area, as well as chlorophyll content; minimum and maximum fluorescence; and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II; shoot height/stem diameter ratio and Dickson's Quality Index. The B. amyloliquefaciens inoculation promoted an increase in seedling shoot height, stem diameter, root length, leaf area, shoot, root, and total dry matter and also increased the Dickson Quality Index. It can be concluded that B. amyloliquefaciens is the most efficient inoculant for producing golden trumpet tree seedlings, followed by A. brasilense. .

TI  - Surface runoff in six years of rehabilitation of two areas after bauxite mining in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of surface runoff pre-mining and during six years of rehabilitation with Eucalyptus plantation, postmining, in bauxite mining areas was the central objective of this work. Surface runoff was monitored from January to May before mining and in the same months from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation, being collected in seven plots in two bauxite mining areas in southeastern Brazil. The factors that interfere with runoff were characterized in all periods, statistically compared by the Wilcoxon test and submitted to principal component analysis (PCA). The total surface runoff in the five months before mining was 1.74 to 14.06 times greater than the runoff in the same months in the six years of rehabilitation. The average percentage runoff was <1% of the precipitation in all rehabilitation periods, in contrast before mining 1.3% of the precipitation of 556 mm became surface runoff. The highest slopes of the regression were for the first year of rehabilitation and for the pre-mining period, showing a greater influence of precipitation on the generation of surface runoff. Soil, litter and vegetation characteristics were the most explanatory factors in the six-year PCA. Specific factors must be viewed with caution on micro scale in each year of rehabilitation of surface bauxite mines, due to soil heterogeneity and consequent vegetation, seeking to minimize the negative effects on surface runoff. Gap in knowledge about surface runoff percentages in six years of rehabilitation in Brazil and tropical areas was filled. Mine managers can more clearly define the priority factors in strategies to mitigate the effects of mining on the environment from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation in surface mined areas.

TI  - Do tropical climatic conditions reduce the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors? A meta-analysis of studies carried out in Brazil
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Extensive research has been performed into the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) in preventing N losses; however, tropical agriculture has been underrepresented in recent meta-analyses. Here, we apply a meta-analytic approach using data from 50 articles to identify the impact of NIs (DMPP, DCD, and DCD + NBPT) on crop yield, N2O emissions, soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, and NH3 volatilization in subtropical and tropical regions of Brazil. In addition, the survey includes information about location; climate zone; cultivated crops; soil pH; soil organic carbon; soil texture; experimental method; soil management; irrigation; fertilizer source, rate, and type; and NI type and rate. Overall, the data set showed that NIs increased crop yield and soil NH4+ concentrations by 3 and 60%, respectively, whereas N2O emissions and soil NO3- concentrations were reduced by 62 and 31%, respectively. Ammonia volatilization was not changed by NI application. However, the combination of a NI with a urease inhibitor decreased such losses by 39%. The effectiveness of the NIs was highest in irrigated fields, fine-textured soils, and mineral N sources. Moreover, NI performance in Brazil was found to be similar in tropical and subtropical climates, and was also comparable to values previously reported in meta-analyses, including those conducted in temperate climates. Therefore, NI application is indicated to be an efficient strategy to delay nitrification and mitigate N2O emissions in tropical agroecosystems.

TI  - State-led social and environmental policy failure in a Brazilian forest frontier: Sustainable Development Project in Anapu, Para acute accent
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we analyze transformations within a land reform settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, with special land-use regulations targeting forest conservation. We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatoba ' Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy.

TI  - AUTOECOLOGY, DIVERSITY, AND INTERNAL GENETIC STRUCTURE OF Ocotea porosa (NEES & MART.) BARROSO: SUBSIDIES FOR SEED COLLECTION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration mitigates the negative effects of fragmentation and habitat loss. This practice allows the conservation of key species, such as Ocotea porosa, a tree native to the Araucaria Forest and extremely endangered. A key point in restoration projects is the source of seeds, as well as guidelines for collection. When carried out under technical criteria, the collection allows the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptive potential in restoration plantations. Given the importance of seed source, genetic diversity, and adaptive potential, this study aimed to define areas and criteria for collecting seeds by characterizing the demography, genetics, and reproductive phenology of an O. porosa population. A plot of 16 hectares was installed in the municipality of Passos Maia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and a demographic survey of trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 15 cm was carried out. Indices of diversity and internal genetic structure (IGS) were estimated using allozyme markers. The reproductive phenology of 67 individuals was evaluated during 8 months. The studied population showed a high density of individuals (10.7 ind. ha(-1)) with normal diametric distribution. The phenological pattern of the species is regular, seasonal, and annual. The evaluated population showed high genetic diversity, high fixation index, and significant IGS up to 80 meters away. Based on these results, the evaluated fragment can be used as a seed collection area. It has high genetic diversity, density, and area size sufficient to contain several demes. In addition, it is highly recommended that the matrices be at least 80 meters apart to avoid the effects of significant IGS.

TI  - The "New Transamazonian Highway": BR-319 and Its Current Environmental Degradation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian government intends to complete the paving of the BR-319 highway, which connects Porto Velho in the deforestation arc region with Manaus in the middle of the Amazon Forest. This paving is being planned despite environmental legislation, and there is concern that its effectiveness will cause additional deforestation, threatening large portions of forest, conservation units (CUs), and indigenous lands (ILs) in the surrounding areas. In this study, we evaluated environmental degradation along the BR-319 highway from 2008 to 2020 and verified whether highway maintenance has contributed to deforestation. For this purpose, we created a 20 km buffer adjacent to the BR-319 highway and evaluated variables extracted from remote sensing information between 2008 and 2020. Fire foci, burned areas, and rainfall data were used to calculate a drought index using statistical tests for a time series. Furthermore, these were related to data on deforestation, CUs, and ILs using principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation. Our results showed that 743 km(2) of forest was deforested during the period evaluated, most of which occurred in the last four years. A total of 16,472 fire foci were identified. Both deforestation and fire foci occurred mainly outside the CUs and ILs. The most affected areas were close to capital cities, and after resuming road maintenance in 2015, deforestation increased outside the capital cities. Current government policy for Amazon occupation promotes deforestation and will compromise Brazil's climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and deforestation.

TI  - The role of central government and local government and the moderating effect of good governance on forest fire policy in Indonesia
T2  - BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate forest fires and their relationship to prevention and mitigation strategies based on the empirical problems raised by this study. Public policy implementation (in this case, the policy of forest fire management) is influenced by the role played by government and by the participation of the public and stakeholders (in this case, companies), as well as the effects of good governance. Thus, from the empirical problems associated with theoretical problems and normative problems, this study raises the influence of the role of central and local government on the implementation of forest fire prevention policy in Indonesia, which is moderated by the good governance variable.Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative approach by adopting survey methodology. The study has aimed to assess both large and small population groups, by selecting and reviewing carefully chosen samples of the population to find the incidence, distribution and relative interrelation of the variables considered (Kerlinger and Lee, 2000). The survey was undertaken in areas of Indonesia that have a high level of vulnerability to forest fires. There are currently six provinces - Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and South Kalimantan - that have the highest intensity of forest fires. The study population was taken from 105 villages in those six major provinces experiencing forest fires. Sample size precision was determined by using Slovin's formula with a precision of 10 percent and, thus, a sample size of 52 was obtained.Findings The central government's activities have no significant effect on regional forest fire prevention. However, the results found that there is a significant effect caused by the interaction between the central and local governments and their governance of forest fire prevention. Even though the direct effect is not significant, the interaction effect significantly influences the forest fire prevention governance variable, which is a pure moderator. This study found that the role of central government has no effect on forest fire prevention. If the role of the central government is high, it will not impact the effectiveness of forest fire prevention, which is reflected in the aspects of prevention and early warning, reward and punishment, the improvement and management of ecosystems by reviewing courts, law enforcement and national and regional synergy.Originality/value This is one of the few public administration science studies to have investigated the relationship between good governance and forest fire policy in Indonesia, particularly the combined roles played by central and local governments.

TI  - POSTHARVEST NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM A SUBTROPICAL OXISOL AS INFLUENCED BY SUMMER CROP RESIDUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential. This research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Three treatments were evaluated, one under conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize). N2O emissions were measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers. Gas flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30,45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography. After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m(-2) N) than under CT (51 mg m(-2) N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m(-2) h(-1) N. In contrast, soil N2O emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of 127 g m(-2) h(-1) N. The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main driving variables of soil N2O emissions were soil microbial activity, temperature, water-filled pore space, and NO3- content. To replace soybean monoculture, crop rotation including maize must be considered as a strategy to decrease soil N2O emissions from NT soils in Southern Brazil in a Autumn.

TI  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) pesticide policy and integrated pest management in certified tropical plantations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was the first non-governmental organization composed of multi-stakeholders to ensure the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of forest resources. FSC prohibits certain chemicals and active ingredients in certified forest plantations. A company seeking certification must discontinue use of products so listed and many face problems to comply with these constraints. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of certification on pest management from the perspective of Brazilian private forestry sector. Ninety-three percent of Brazilian FSC-certified forest companies rated leaf-cutting ants as "very important" pests. Chemical control was the most important management technique used and considered very important by 82 % of respondents. The main chemical used to control leaf-cutting ants, sulfluramid, is in the derogation process and was classified as very important by 96.5 % of the certified companies. Certified companies were generally satisfied in relation to FSC certification and the integrated management of forest pests, but 27.6 % agreed that the prohibitions of pesticides for leaf-cutting ant and termite control could be considered as a non-tariff barrier on high-productivity Brazilian forest plantations. FSC forest certification has encouraged the implementation of more sustainable techniques and decisions in pest management in forest plantations in Brazil. The prohibition on pesticides like sulfluramid and the use of alternatives without the same efficiency will result in pest mismanagement, production losses, and higher costs. This work has shown that the application of global rules for sustainable forest management needs to adapt to each local reality.

TI  - Long-term loblolly pine land use reduces methane and net greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical Cambisol, despite increasing nitrous oxide
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - circle Key message In loblolly pine land use of 17-32 years following forest clearing, CH(4)consumption and N2O emission diminished by 17 years, due to high soil moisture (similar to 80% WFPS, N2O into N-2), but increased by 32 years, where medium moisture favoured methanotrophy and denitrification into N2O. Soil greenhouse gases (GHG) emission was positive by 17 years, but negative by 32, when soil sequestered carbon. circle Context Much of the role of planted forests in the gaseous soil-atmosphere exchanges in the subtropics remains to be evaluated. circle Aims To assess the impacts of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a subtropical Cambisol. circle Methods Fluxes were monitored over 1 year with static chambers, in forest stands under natural forest (NF) and pine plantation for 17 (P17) and 32 years (P32). circle Results The NF soil showed the lowest N2O emission and the highest CH4 consumption, because of the lowest water-filled pore space (WFPS, < 40%) and highest soil macroporosity. In P17, N2O emission was still low, but CH4 consumption diminished sixfold, possibly because of the predominance of methanotrophy, favoured by the highest WFPS (similar to 80%) and lowest macroporosity that together with low mineral N concentration also did not favour the formation of N2O. In P32, the improved soil mineral N, macroporosity and intermediate WFPS ( similar to 60%) increased CH4 consumption and also N2O emission, in an environment supposedly favourable to methanotrophy and also to N2O production. Considering soil organic carbon (SOC) from a concurrent study, the net GHG emission (Mg C-eq ha(-1) year(-1)) was 2.8 in P17 and - 1.1 in P32. circle Conclusion Soil under pine plantation is the source of GHG in the first rotation (17 years), because of the low CH4 consumption and SOC losses, but soil becomes C sink in the second rotation (32 years), by sequestering SOC and consuming more CH4, despite emitting more N2O.

TI  - Analysis of the multidimensional characteristics of Tabernaemontana heterophylla seeds
T2  - CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of Tabernaemontana heterophylla seeds entails morphological characterization and the study of genetic variability between batches. This knowledge is fundamental for evolutionary biology and agronomic and conservation practices. Crop productivity, species preservation, reforestation, and post-harvest processing can all benefit from understanding and considering seed size. This work aimed to determine the multidimensional characteristics and mass of the seeds using multivariate cluster analysis. We investigated multidimensional characteristics by measuring the dimensions and mass of the seeds and computing their physical attributes. Several statistical measures were used to assess the morphometric data, including the mean, amplitude, coefficient of variation, relative frequency, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval. In addition, grouping patterns and inter-variable dependencies were examined by multivariate cluster analysis using Ward's method. The results revealed significant variability in seed dimensions, indicating morphological unevenness in the seeds of this species. Euclidean distance analysis identified the formation of subclusters, implying distinct groupings based on seed size and mass. The finding highlights the significance of segregating lots with similar physical characteristics and defining representative properties for management practices. These variations reflect the genetic diversity required for adaptability and ecological resilience, ensuring forest ecosystems' survival and proper functioning. Alternatively, classifying and standardizing seed lots based on these physical traits can optimize post-harvest processing and increase agronomic productivity.

TI  - Growth and nutrient accumulation of Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) in agroforestry at different fertilizer levels
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is a frequent component of agroforestry systems in the Amazon because of its adaptation to nutrient-poor upland soils and multiple uses. We investigated the aboveground biomass production (kg dry weight), nutrient uptake and requirements (N, P, Ca, Mg, K) of Brazil nut trees of different sizes grown under agroforestry conditions and fertilized at different levels. Eight of 70 experimental trees with different size were harvested and stem, branches and leaves were separated. Nutrient contents were determined for three trees of varying size. Average tree growth was fast, but variability was high, suggesting considerable potential for the improvement of this economically important species. The trees responded to increased levels of fertilizer and lime with significantly increased foliar nutrient contents and growth, probably because of the improved availability of Mg and Ca for which the species seems to have a relatively high demand. In contrast to Brazil nut trees grown in forest or dense plantations, the agroforestry trees invested a substantial part of their biomass and nutrients in large branches and developed spreading crowns. To improve stem form, reduce competition with associated crops for light and recycle nutrients, regular pruning of lower branches or planting arrangements that favor self-pruning are recommended. These measures would also increase the recycling of Ca and Mg, large quantities of which are contained in the branches.

TI  - Reassessing the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil to help meet sustainability goals
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The potential for sugarcane ethanol from Brazil to mitigate GHG emissions is undeniable, but the way that ethanol is produced during the agricultural and industrial phases will ultimately determine its benefits to society. In this paper, we evaluate the environmental impacts of sugarcane agriculture and ethanol production in Brazil as management practices continue to change and production expands to new frontiers. We focused our evaluation on the impacts on water, atmosphere, and soils, including how the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers and the accumulation of crop residue in the field affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). We also addressed the impacts of land use changes on threatened biomes and discussed some of the present obstacles regarding conservation and restoration efforts. We concluded that, since a similar assessment was put forth in 2008, our knowledge about the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has advanced with regard to soil degradation, nitrogen dynamics, and soil carbon stocks. However, more information is still needed about the impacts of the increasing use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers in sugarcane agriculture, especially on water resources. Furthermore, without a better understanding about how landscape fragmentation affects the biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic tropical ecosystems and the services they provide, policies created to protect and restore them may be ineffective. On the other hand, the use of presently available scientific information to end unsustainable farming and the implementation of conservation strategies proposed by the Brazilian Forest Code could be a first step to guarantee that ethanol is produced more sustainably in Brazil.

TI  - Ecotoxicology of mercury in tropical forest soils: Impact on earthworms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic nonessential trace metals in the environment, with high persistence and bioaccumulation potential, and hence of serious concern to environmental quality and public health. Emitted to the atmosphere, this element can travel long distances, far from emission sources. Hg speciation can lead to Hg contamination of different ecosystem components, as well as biomagnification in trophic food webs. To evaluate the effects of atmospheric Hg deposition in tropical forests, we investigated Hg concentrations in earthworm tissues and soils of two Forest Conservation Units in State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Next, we performed a laboratory study of the biological responses (cast analysis and behavioral, acute, chronic and bioaccumulation ecotoxicological tests) of two earthworms species (Pontoscolex corethrurus and Eisenia andrei) to Hg contamination in tropical artificial soil (TAS) and two natural forest soils (NS) spiked with increasing concentration of HgCl2. Field results showed Hg concentrations up to 13 times higher in earthworm tissues than in forest soils, while in the laboratory Hg accumulation after 91-days of exposure was 25 times greater in spiked-soils with 128 mg Hg kg(-1) (dry wt) than in control (unspiked) soils. In all the toxicity tests P. corethrurus showed a higher adaptability or resistance to mercury than E. andrei. The role of earthworms as environmental bioremediators was confirmed in this study, showing their ability to greatly bioaccumulate trace metals while reducing Hg availability in feces.

TI  - Measuring and modeling nitrous oxide and methane emissions from beef cattle feedlot manure management: First assessments under Brazilian condition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive beef production has increased during recent decades in Brazil and may substantially increase both methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure management. However, the quantification of these gases and methods for extrapolating them are scarce in Brazil. A case study examines CH4 and N2O emissions from one typical beef cattle feedlot manure management continuum in Brazil and the applicability of Manure-DNDC model in predicting these emissions for better understand fluxes and mitigation options. Measurements track CH4 and N2O emissions from manure excreted in one housing floor holding 21 animals for 78days, stockpiled for 73days and field spread (360kg N ha(-1)). We found total emissions (CH4 + N2O) of 0.19 +/- 0.10kg CO(2)eq per kg of animal live weight gain; mostly coming from field application (73%), followed housing (25%) and storage (2%). The Manure-DNDC simulations were generally within the statistical deviation ranges of the field data, differing in -28% in total emission. Large uncertainties in measurements showed the model was more accurate estimating the magnitude of gases emissions than replicate results at daily basis. Modeled results suggested increasing the frequency of manure removal from housing, splitting the field application and adopting no-tillage system is the most efficient management for reducing emissions from manure (up to about 75%). Since this work consists in the first assessment under Brazilian conditions, more and continuous field measurements are required for decreasing uncertainties and improving model validations. However, this paper reports promising results and scientific perceptions for the design of further integrated work on farm-scale measurements and Manure-DNDC model development for Brazilian conditions.

TI  - Biological and phylogenetic analyses suggest that two Cryphonectria spp. cause cankers of Eucalyptus in Africa
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryphonectria cubensis is an economically important pathogen of commercial Eucalyptus spp. Differences have been reported for disease symptoms associated with Cryphonectria canker in South Africa and other parts of the world, and recent DNA-based comparisons have confirmed that the fungus in South Africa is different from that in South America and Australasia. During a disease survey in the Republic of Congo, Cryphonectria canker was identified as an important disease on Eucalyptus grandis and E. urophylla. In this study, we compared Congolese and South African isolates of C. cubensis using DNA sequence data and pathogenicity under greenhouse conditions. The beta-tubulin and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences show that C. cubensis in Congo is different from the fungus in South Africa and that Congolese isolates group most closely with South American isolates. Furthermore, pathogenicity tests showed that a South African isolate was more aggressive than two Congolese isolates. We conclude that two distinct Cryphonectria spp. occur in Africa and hypothesize that the fungus in the Congo probably was introduced into Africa from South America. Both fungi are important pathogens causing disease and death of economically important plantation trees. However, they apparently have different origins and must be treated separately in terms of disease management and quarantine considerations.

TI  - Morphological and photosynthetic alterations in the Yellow-ipe, Tabebuia chrysotricha (Mart. Ex DC.) Standl., under nursery shading and gas exchange after being transferred to full sunlight
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nursery shading on the Yellow-ipe seedling (Tabebuia chrysotricha) growth, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic acclimation after being transferred into direct sunlight. The Yellow-ipe seedlings were grown under 0, 50, 70 and 95% shade. At the 134th day of sowing, leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll were measured under current growth shading, after exposure to 15 min and two day full sunlight. With the increase of shading, the Yellow-ipe seedlings allocated more biomass to the stem and leaves and less to the roots, and there was an increase in the leaf area ratio and specific leaf area. In relation to 0% of shading there was a increase of 211% in stem, 116% in leaf, and a reduction of 200% in roots biomass when seedling were grown under 95% of shading. The total biomass accumulation had a high correlation with collar diameter (r = 0.96). More than 70% of the shading reduced the photosynthesis, and after transferring the seedlings into full sunlight, more than 50% of the shading induced a reduction in chlorophyll, stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, suggesting the presence of a photoinhibition process. The Yellow-ipe seedling growth under nursery conditions should not be done under more than 50% shading, which may result in the lower seedling quality and poorer acclimation to transplantation, particularly to severe degraded areas with direct sunlight. The species can be used for recovering from totally devastated forest areas to initial recovery when full canopy are forming.

TI  - Global chocolate supply is limited by low pollination and high temperatures
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) provides livelihoods for 5 million smallholder farmers, but the factors limiting cocoa yield are poorly understood. We present a global analysis of pollination, cocoa tree, plantation, and climate factors affecting cocoa yield, with experimental data from three major cocoa-producing countries: Brazil, Ghana and Indonesia. Hand-pollination increased yield by 20%, showing cocoa yield is limited by pollination, but not nutrients. Leaf litter and large cacao trees, measures of soil resource availability and access, increased yield by 9-19%. Cooler temperatures by 7 degrees C during the hot season increased yield by up to 31%, indicating substantial risks from climate warming. Agricultural production that enhances cocoa pollinator abundance, protects soils, and mitigates climate risks will be the most effective way to secure global cocoa production and support livelihoods into the future.

TI  - Mating system and inbreeding depression in Hymenaea stigonocarpa
T2  - TREE GENETICS & GENOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - In tree species, inbreeding due to selfing or biparental mating may decrease offspring adaptation and growth due to inbreeding depression (ID). Degenerative effects of ID, mainly reduction in productivity and survival, are undesirable for ex-situ conservation, improvement, and environmental and commercial reforestation of tree species. The effects of ID resulting from self-fertilization and biparental inbreeding were assessed for the traits cylindrical volume and survival in juvenile individuals of Hymenaea stigonocarpa in a progeny test (0.83 ha) at 4 and 7 years of age. The progeny test was established for ex situ conservation in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and was based on seeds collected from a wild population. Nine microsatellite loci were used to genotype 48 adult (plot = 4.3 ha) and 612 juvenile samples to determine spatial genetic structure (for adults), inbreeding, mating system, and pollen dispersal pattern. Spatial genetic structure was observed up to 82 m. Reproduction occurred mainly by outcrossing, with low rates of selfing (7.5%) and biparental inbreeding (13.2%). Mating was not random due to the fat-tail pollen dispersal pattern, resulting in high pollen immigration (70.1%) and low mean pollen dispersal distance (105 m) within the sample area. Inbreeding was observed only in juveniles, indicating selection against inbred individuals between juvenile and adult stages. The volume trait showed higher ID for biparental inbreeding (41.5-44.0%) than for self-fertilization (29.1-42.6%). Volume also showed greater ID than survival. Our results show that even low rates of selfing and biparental inbreeding can decrease the productivity of H. stigonocarpa plantations.

TI  - Effect of flaxseed root performance on the structural quality of a Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal was to evaluate the root development of flaxseed and its relationship with soil aggregation and organic carbon storage in two sowing seasons under soil conservationist management, in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We used three flaxseed genotypes: Aguara and Cabure from Argentina, and Gold from Brazil, sowings in April and May in a no-tillage system under Haplumbrept. In the flowering stage, the root system was evaluated by image analyze using a Safira software. Root distribution maps were used by geostatistical kriging. At the harvest stage, soil blocks were sampled for analyze the aggregates morphometry by image with Quantporo software and the soil organic carbon. Undisturbed soil were sampled to determine the physical attributes. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with three repetitions, anova was performed by Fisher and the means compared by Tukey test. No physical impediments were found for the roots performance in the Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, these favored the irregularity of the aggregates surface observed by the low values of aspect and roughness in the different tested diameter ranges. Both Cabure and Aguara genotypes showed good roots spatial distribution in the soil profile in both sowing seasons with an increase in carbon storage in the smallest diameter aggregates (here considered the aggregates of 4.76-1 mm). Cabure genotype is the best genotype adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions evaluated because had a greater roots volume, area and length below to 0.15 m depth.

TI  - Social Capital of Banjarese for Peatland Fire Mitigation: Combining of Local Wisdom and Environment
T2  - WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeated fires cause peatlands to degrade. Fire management has been carried out, but fires continue to occur, especially during the dry season. Through social capital that exists in the community based on the local wisdom of the Banjar people in environmental management, it is hoped that peatland fires can be overcome in this area. This research aims to analyze the social capital of the Banjar people in mitigating land fires based on local wisdom and the environment. The sample in this study was 250 people who live in an area prone to fires on peatlands in Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. There are three variables in this study, namely Trust (T), Network (N), and Norm (N). There are 33 Likert scale questions (1-4, strongly agree-strongly disagree). We also conducted interviews with 20 members of the Fire Care Community (MPA) to obtain information about the social capital of the Banjar community in mitigating land fires. The analysis used is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The study results show norms have the greatest influence on disaster mitigation of peatland fires compared to trust and social networks. Norms in the community in the form of values from peatlands, rules, norms, and sanctions regulate the community more to deal with the problem of peatland fires than trust and social networks

TI  - Comparative Multi-Criteria Assessment of Climate Policies and Sustainable Development Strategies in Cameroon: Towards a GIS Decision-Support Tool for the Design of an Optimal REDD plus Strategy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cameroon is committed to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+). To achieve this goal, the government has introduced a series of policy reforms and formulated a number of key strategic planning documents to advance the REDD+ readiness process in Cameroon. This paper assesses the extent to which major cross-sectoral policies support or impede the development and implementation of an optimal REDD+ strategy in Cameroon from a comparative multi-criteria perspective. Study results reveal that a majority of the policy instruments reviewed appeared to be less prescriptive in terms of any tangible REDD+ strategy, as they do not have provisions for tangible measures to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. Given the lack of adequate flexibility, prompt review and responsiveness of these cross-sectoral policies to adapt themselves to new realities and respond to a changing environment, this paper introduces a GIS-REDD+ decision support system (GIS-REDD+DSS) that is necessary to support the adaptive element of an adaptive REDD+ strategy in Cameroon. The GIS-REDD+DSS, an electronic REDD+agri intermediary hub, serves the following purpose: (1) host a database of locally-relevant climate information, improved input technologies, best practices as well as land use and forest cover geo-spatial maps; (2) host a virtual economic tool that performs economic valuations (costs and benefits) and financial analysis of REDD+agri projects to aid investment decision-making; and (3) host an electronic marketplace to mediate any-to-any transactions among REDD+agri project developers, service providers, input suppliers, private and institutional investors and buyers (wholesalers and retailers), thereby creating value in two ways: aggregation and matching. This decision support tool, we argue, is a fundamental prerequisite for policy and REDD+ safeguard integration innovation that allows new scientific findings to be integrated into REDD+ strategies in a short period of time.

TI  - Short term effects in soil quality under different cover crops of no tillage vegetables organic production in fragile soils in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Regenerative agriculture practices, including crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage, and no-tillage, have gained recognition for mitigating soil erosion and enhancing soil quality. This study focuses on organic vegetable production in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where soils are sandy and nutrient-poor. The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical-chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance. This research highlights the potential of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops to improve soil fertility, enhance carbon sequestration, and support sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Relating visual evaluation of soil structure to other physical properties in soils of contrasting texture and management
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of agricultural systems depends on the evaluation and monitoring of soil use and tillage in order to mitigate soil degradation. The visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) was developed to provide a quick, simple and easily understood test to enable researchers, farmers and consultants to score soil quality. In this paper we test the hypothesis that soil structural quality, as specified by VESS (S-q), is sensitive enough to identify differences in structure, resulting from soil management, in and between layers of topsoil. The S-q score ranges from 1 (good) to 5 (poor soil structure). Improvements have already been made to this method, but we wished to test the validity of S-q results compared with other indicators of soil physical quality. Our aims were (1) to evaluate the usefulness of VESS to compare layering of topsoil structure under different soil management and (2) to identify which soil physical properties S-q most closely relates to. We chose to work on soils of contrasting texture in response to criticism that the test works well only on medium-textured soils. In our first experiment, we assessed Scottish soil from native forest that had never been cropped and from arable soils just after harvest so where there was a visible difference between soil tracked or not tracked during harvesting operations. Soil qualities measured were soil resistance to penetration (SR), bulk density (B-d) and air permeability (K-a). In our second experiment we compared the least limiting water range (LLWR) with VESS in a Brazilian Oxisol under no-tillage. VESS showed the differences between the treatments and layers of topsoil. S-q increased with SR and B-d but decreased with air permeability. Results for LLWR showed that for S-q >= 3.5, the LLWR was zero, indicating soil physical condition highly restrictive to plants. Harvest is a time of significant soil compaction and the VESS test detected compaction even where it was not visible at the surface and as such may prove useful in diagnosing and remediating compaction and assessing suitability for minimum tillage.

TI  - Assessing Dominant Production Systems in the Eastern Amazon Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agricultural frontiers in the Amazon region poses a significant threat to forest conservation and biodiversity persistence. This study focuses on Par & aacute; state, Brazil, aiming to identify and characterize the predominant production systems by combining remote sensing data and landscape structure metrics. A rule-based classification tree algorithm is applied to classify hexagonal cells based on land cover, deforestation patterns, and distance from dairy facilities. The results reveal three dominant production systems: Natural Region, Non-Intensive Beef, and Initial Front, with livestock production being prominent. The analysis indicates that there is a correlation between the productive area and deforestation, emphasizing the role of agriculture as a driver of forest loss. Moreover, road networks significantly influence production system spatial distribution, highlighting the importance of infrastructure in land use dynamics. The Shannon diversity index reveals that areas with production systems exhibit greater diversity in land use and land cover classes, reflecting a wider range of modifications. In contrast, natural vegetation areas show lower Shannon values, suggesting that these areas are more intact and are less affected by human activities. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable development policies that will mitigate threats to forest resilience and biodiversity in Par & aacute; state.

TI  - Food matters: Trophodynamics and the role of diet in the invasion success of Procambarus clarkii in an Atlantic Forest conservation area
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Procambarus clarkii is an important invasive freshwater species whose ecological plasticity allows for its establishment in different kinds of environments; such plasticity is also reflected in its diet with two main consequences: invasion success and impact on native biota. In order to investigate P. clarkii's feeding habits, examine how its diet varies both seasonally and among different demographic groups (reproductive males, non-reproductive males and females) and explore the two consequences mentioned above, we investigated the trophic role of this species in an Atlantic Forest conservation area in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil). A total of 540 specimens collected monthly over a year were measured and weighed. Their stomachs were weighed and classified according to the degree of stomach fullness. Stomach contents were examined, and animal and plant matter weighed. Food items were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and the percentage of occurrence of each item was calculated, as well as the diet diversity. Collected data were compared according to seasons and demographic groups through the Analysis of Similarity and Similarity Percentage Analysis. The percentage of animal weight attributed to stomach weight and the degree of fullness of stomachs did not vary significantly among seasons; however, non-reproductive males had significantly less full stomachs. Diet composition was evenly balanced between plant and animal material for both reproductive males and females, while non-reproductive males consumed a lower proportion of animal matter. The diversity in diet composition was high in all seasons and for all demographic groups, although always slightly lower for non-reproductive males. The percentage of occurrence of food items evidenced high consumption of algae and macrophytes throughout the year. It also reflected the seasonal variation of consumed prey, with a shift in consumption of insects and microcrustaceans in spring and summer to decapods and amphibians in fall and winter. The dissimilarity in diet composition was more pronounced among demographic groups than among seasons, being non-reproductive males the most different, with higher ingesting of less evasive prey. Nonetheless, winter differed from other seasons and was the season with least different food composition among demographic groups, indicating a homogenization in diet composition, which might be due to restricted availability of resources. Procambarus clarkii at Jaragua State Park demonstrated conspicuous dietary variability and flexibility. The occurrence of filled stomachs indicates that food resources are not a constriction for this population. The species presented a diversified and adaptable diet, foraging on algae and macrophytes, and preying on different vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Its trophic plasticity favors successful establishment in invaded areas and summed to its notable voracity, P. clarkii offers a wide, variable and significant interaction in food webs, being able to generate major impacts on native species by its feeding habits.

TI  - Differences in common bean rhizobial populations associated with soil tillage management in southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Progressive adoption of no-tillage (NT) agriculture in the tropics is finally reversing physical, chemical, and biological erosion of soil and in Brazil, an estimated 19 Mha are now devoted to NT. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a main component of Brazilian agriculture, and enhancement of yields has been achieved under NT as a result of mitigation of environmental stresses, resulting in higher N-2 fixation. However, the effects of Wort rhizobial diversity are poorly understood. This study evaluated rhizobial diversity in soils planted to common bean under NT or conventional tillage (CT) systems that were compared with natural grassland used for grazing, in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Genetic diversity was assessed by the amplification of the DNA by PCR with specific primers (BOX-PCR) and by RFLP-PCR analyses of the 16S rDNA region. A high level of diversity was observed among strains from all three systems, such that the similarity in the clustering analysis of BOX-PCR products ranged from 36% under natural grassland to only 23% for CT strains. High polymorphism was confirmed in the RFLP-PCR analysis; forty-seven different profiles were obtained, none sharing high similarity with the profiles of reference species of common bean rhizobia. These results indicate that other tropical rhizobial species remain to be described. Genetic diversity was higher among the NT than the CT rhizobial strains, especially when the RFLP-PCR profiles were considered. Genetic diversity in the natural grassland was lower than in the cropped systems, possibly due to absence of the host plant and stubble burning in winter. Average yields in the area under NT (e.g. common bean, approximately 1500 kg ha(-1)) have been about 30% higher than under CT, therefore high rhizobial diversity may be a parameter indicative of superior soil quality.

TI  - Bayesian Decision-Network Modeling of Multiple Stakeholders for Reef Ecosystem Restoration in the Coral Triangle
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proposals for marine conservation measures have proliferated in the last 2 decades due to increased reports of fishery declines and interest in conservation. Fishers and fisheries managers have often disagreed strongly when discussing controls on fisheries. In such situations, ecosystem-based models and fisheries-stock assessment models can help resolve disagreements by highlighting the trade-offs that would be made under alternative management scenarios. We extended the analytical framework for modeling such trade-offs by including additional stakeholders whose livelihoods and the value they place on conservation depend on the condition of the marine ecosystem. To do so, we used Bayesian decision-network models (BDNs) in a case study of an Indonesian coral reef fishery. Our model included interests of the fishers and fishery managers; individuals in the tourism industry; conservation interests of the state, nongovernmental organizations, and the local public; and uncertainties in ecosystem status, projections of fisheries revenues, tourism growth, and levels of interest in conservation. We calculated the total utility (i.e., value) of a range of restoration scenarios. Restricting net fisheries and live-fish fisheries appeared to be the best compromise solutions under several combinations of settings of modeled variables. Results of our case study highlight the implications of alternate formulations for coral reef stakeholder utility functions and discount rates for the calculation of the net benefits of alternative fisheries management options. This case study may also serve as a useful example for other decision analyses with multiple stakeholders.

TI  - Approaches for Understanding and Embedding Stakeholder Realities in Mangrove Rehabilitation Processes in Southeast Asia: Lessons Learnt from Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a soft systems narrative, this paper examines the implementation process growing out of a policy environment intended to promote the rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystems. The analysis is based on research conducted 2007-09 in the Mahakam Delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. The rich and diverse natural resource base of the area has turned East Kalimantan into one of the wealthiest areas in Indonesia. The case from Mahakam reveals that there is no stakeholder consensus in terms of problem definitions and management priorities of the coastal delta area. Further, there are no institutional bodies or 'guardians' responsible for monitoring and facilitating the long-term sustainability of mangrove systems. There are also significant power imbalances in the system, not only between stakeholders, but also between the discourses of conservation and production. In order to ensure the long-term, sustainable governance of mangrove systems, these institutional and geopolitical issues will need to be addressed and adapted accordingly. Through a structured systemic inquiry, this analysis has explored the problem situation related to the sustainability of mangrove systems for coastal environments and people. The research shows the complexity in managing dynamic coastal systems subjected to rapid human induced biophysical changes exacerbated by a non-conducive policy environment aggravating the impact on the ground.The absence of this guardian implies that feedback and institutional learning is not inherent, making constructive adaptation of governance and management arrangements in this context unlikely.

TI  - Strategies and engineering adaptions to disseminate SRI methods in large-scale irrigation systems in Eastern Indonesia
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The system of rice intensification (SRI) developed in Madagascar has been controversial in part because there have been no large-scale, long-term evaluations of the impact of its alternative methods. This paper summarizes experience with the dissemination of SRI practices across eight provinces in Eastern Indonesia over nine seasons from 2002 to 2006 under a major irrigation project. The Decentralized Irrigation System Improvement Project (DISIMP) was financed by the Japanese Government with project management by a Nippon Koei consultant team. SRI has been introduced in Indonesia via several organizations and in different parts of the country starting in 2000. The evaluation reported here, made by the DISIMP technical assistance team, is based on data from 12,133 on-farm comparison trials that covered a total area of 9,429 ha. Under SRI management, average paddy yield increase was 3.3 t/ha (78%). This was achieved with about 40% reduction in water use, 50% reduction in chemical fertilizer applications, and 20% lower costs of production. The farmers whom DISIMP was assisting to take up SRI were usually cultivating their paddy fields individually within irrigation systems where it was difficult to reduce water applications as recommended for SRI. Accordingly, innovations had to be made in soil and water management to create relatively aerobic soil conditions so that farmers could get the more productive rice phenotypes expected from SRI practice. This article describes the modifications made to adapt SRI concepts, pointing to the value of introducing in-field ditches, which was confirmed through paddy tract surveys. This experience and analysis showed how SRI methods could be utilized within irrigation systems where water management was not (yet) tailored to SRI production practices. Subsequently, modifications in irrigation system management are being made to be more supportive of SRI cultivation.

TI  - Effects of soil flooding on leaf gas exchange and growth of two neotropical pioneer tree species
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) and Rapanea ferruginea (Ruiz & Pavon) Mez (Myrsinaceae) are two neotropical pioneer trees with wide geographical distribution in South America, highly degree of adaptation to different soil conditions and intense regeneration in areas with anthropic activities. With the aim to recommend the use Schinus and Rapanea in gallery forest restoration programs, we conducted an experiment with the objective to analyze the capacity of these two pioneer trees to tolerate soil flooding, mainly by accessing the effects of flooding on leaf gas exchange, growth and dry matter partitioning. Seedling survival throughout the 56-day flooding period were 100 and 90% for Schinus and Rapanea, respectively. The mean values of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthesis (A) observed in the control seedlings were, respectively, 0.4 mol m(-2) s(-1) and 14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for Schinus, and 0.5 mol m(-2) s(-1) and 14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for Rapanea. On day 20 flooding reduced g(s) and A by 36 and 29% in Schinus, and 81 and 61% in Rapanea. At the end of the experiment, significant decreases were also observed for root and whole plant biomass, in both species. Based on the results, we concluded that seedlings of Schinus and Rapanea can survive and grow throughout a medium period of soil waterlogging, in spite of the alterations observed in their physiological behavior, such as the decreases in stomatal conductance and in whole plant biomass.

TI  - Searching the flames: Trends in global and regional public interest in wildfires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interactions between humans and wildfires have increased in many regions over the last decades driven by climate and land-use changes. A shift towards more adaptive fire management and policies is urgently needed but remains difficult to achieve. Better understanding of public interest in wildfire can facilitate this transition, as the public is a key driver for policy decisions. We used Google Trends to assess temporal patterns (2004-2020) in public interest on wildfires worldwide and in five case study countries (Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal, USA). Public interest consistently shows a cyclic pattern with low background and short-lasting spikes during fire seasons and catastrophic events. Wildfires that receive the most interest worldwide are located in Western countries, especially the USA. There is usually high demand for news on wildfires when spikes in interest happen. Overall global interest in wildfire has risen twice: first for a short period in 2007-2008, concomitant to cata-strophic wildfires in California, and again since 2017, probably triggered by a series of catastrophic fire events around the globe. Nevertheless, public interest in wildfire is low when compared with socioeconomically more costly earthquakes or hurricanes. The short and seasonal interest in wildfire may present an important obstacle to the implementation of wildfire mitigation policies that require year-round approaches. However, the fact that the public uses the internet to obtain basic knowledge about wildfire functioning and impacts, especially during the interest spikes, can facilitate targeting awareness campaigns. These could be not only about wildfires but also about broader related environmental issues.

TI  - Assessing the growth gaps of Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil - Magnitudes causes and possible mitigation strategies
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus growth (stemwood volume, m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)) is conditioned by biotic and abiotic factors, which are related to the climate, genotype, chemical and physical soil conditions, silvicultural practices and forest management. These factors a huge temporal and spatial variability of Eucalyptus growth, leading to growth gaps. Therefore, identifying Eucalyptus growth gaps (GG), their magnitudes and causes may be a powerful tool for establishing strategies to increase forest resiliency and productivity. In this context, the aims of this study were to determinate the Eucalyptus growth gaps by a multimodel approach for different production locations in Brazil and to identify their main causes, possible solutions and mitigation strategies. Three Eucalyptus simulation models (FAO, APSIM and 3PG), properly calibrated and validated, were used for simulating the potential and attainable growth. Actual growth data were obtained from 30 producing locations in Brazil from experimental plantations of the TECHS Project. The growth gaps at all locations in Midwest and Northeast regions of the country were predominantly caused by water deficit. In Southeast and North regions, the water deficit was the main cause of GG in 87% and 67% of the locations, respectively. On the other hand, in Southern Brazil, the suboptimal forest management was the main cause of growth gap at all locations, since water deficit is very low in this region. In general, the water deficit represented the main cause of Eucalyptus growth gap in Brazil; therefore, the use of drought-tolerant genotypes, wider spacing, deeper subsoiling for heavy and cohesive soils, and soil conservation practices (such as maintaining harvest residue on site) for improving water infiltration and root growth are the main strategies to reduce this kind of gap. On the other hand, for reducing the growth gap caused by sub-optimal forest management, the main strategies are better nutrition management, use of high-quality seedlings (improved genetic materials and high nursery quality), and weed control, pests and diseases. In addition to these practices, better monitoring of forest fires, windstorms and waterlogging events by integrating climate, management and genetic strategies also could help to improve Eucalyptus productivity in Brazil.

TI  - Investigation of the potential biomass waste source for biocoke production in Indonesia: A review
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Using biomass waste for renewable energy and sustainable fuel production has gained significant attention recently. This review investigates the potential biomass waste sources for biocoke production in Indonesia. Biocoke, a form of solid fuel derived from biomass, has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional coke in various industrial applications, including steelmaking. This review comprehensively analysed available literature and data sources to identify Indonesia's most abundant and suitable biomass waste sources. The assessment considered biomass availability, sustainability, energy content, and compatibility with biocoke production processes. The environmental impacts associated with the production and utilization of biocoke were also considered. The findings reveal that Indonesia possesses a rich diversity of biomass waste sources with a high potential for biocoke production. Agricultural residues, such as rice straw, corn stalks, and palm oil residues, are identified as promising feedstocks due to their abundance and availability throughout the country. Moreover, biomass waste can contribute to waste management and alleviate environmental concerns associated with open burning and landfilling. The review also highlights the importance of sustainable practices in biomass waste collection and processing. Efficient collection and logistics systems and advanced biomass conversion technologies are crucial to ensure biocoke production's economic viability and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the economic viability of biocoke production is examined by considering factors such as feedstock costs, energy efficiency, and market demand. The potential challenges and barriers, including technological, regulatory, and market-related aspects, are also discussed to provide a comprehensive overview of the feasibility of large-scale biocoke production in Indonesia. Overall, this review underscores the significant potential of biomass waste as a valuable resource for biocoke production in Indonesia. By harnessing the abundant biomass waste streams available in the country, Indonesia can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development in the energy sector.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

The first and second consider the restoration of native vegetation in riparian areas, the third prioritizes restoration sites using biophysical characteristics (optimized restoration scenario derived from Resource Investment Optimization System-RIOS), the fourth considers best management practices and the fifth and sixth are hypothetical extreme scenarios converting all pasture to forest and vice versa. Two hydrological models were developed to represent the distributions of water and yields in the study watershed: HEC-HMS and SWAT. Simulation results indicate that when nature-based solutions are implemented, surface runoff is reduced and ambient storage increases during the rainy season (December-March); while the overall flow increases during the dry season (June-September). The combination of specific hydrologic components of RIOS-customized intervention scenario simulation outputs-namely surface flows and groundwater contribution to stream flows-indicate on average 33% increase in the overall water yield, or 206 hm(3)/year, across the study watershed when comparing against the baseline conditions. In the same modeling scenario, the water storage in the sub-watersheds adjacent to the reservoirs showed an increase of 58% (or 341 hm(3)/year). The results indicate that adopting NbS in the source watershed can mitigate the impacts of extreme drought conditions and contribute toward building long-term water security.

T2  - MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - This study presents a comparative analysis of water quality data in an urban micro watershed to study the magnitude of impacts on the water quality parameters over the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the degree of deterioration using the water quality index.Design/methodology/approach - Rapid urban growth without proper land use and occupation planning results in the overload of urban water resources. Therefore, a literature review was conducted on the research subject published in the dissertation databases of the Engineering Faculty of Ilha Solteira, which resulted in the selection of two dissertations on water quality in the Ipe Stream, Ilha Solteira - SP, Brazil. The results will be evaluated according to the Brazilian laws and regulations in force.Findings - This study shows that pollution and degradation in the stream intensified during the study period, with the most impacted areas within the urban perimeter. Practical implications - The increasing impacts underscore the need for efficient measures such as implementation of retention reservoirs, elimination of clandestine sewage connections and restoration of riparian forests.Originality/value - This study highlights the need to monitor the water quality of streams in order to establish preventive and mitigating measures to avert the growing environmental impacts and to ensure quality water for future generations.

TI  - A policy-driven framework for conserving the best of Earth's remaining moist tropical forests
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests vary in composition, structure and function such that not all forests have similar ecological value. This variability is caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes, which influence the ability of forests to support biodiversity, store carbon, mediate water yield and facilitate human well-being. While international environmental agreements mandate protecting and restoring forests, only forest extent is typically considered, while forest quality is ignored. Consequently, the locations and loss rates of forests of high ecological value are unknown and coordinated strategies for conserving these forests remain undeveloped. Here, we map locations high in forest structural integrity as a measure of ecological quality on the basis of recently developed fine-resolution maps of three-dimensional forest structure, integrated with human pressure across the global moist tropics. Our analyses reveal that tall forests with closed canopies and low human pressure typical of natural conditions comprise half of the global humid or moist tropical forest estate, largely limited to the Amazon and Congo basins. Most of these forests have no formal protection and, given recent rates of loss, are at substantial risk. With the rapid disappearance of these 'best of the last' forests at stake, we provide a policy-driven framework for their conservation and restoration, and recommend locations to maintain protections, add new protections, mitigate deleterious human impacts and restore forest structure.Analysing global high-resolution three-dimensional maps of forest structure, the authors show that only half of the world's remaining moist tropical forest has both high structural integrity and low human pressure, and they outline a framework for its conservation and restoration.

TI  - A biomass map of the Brazilian Amazon from multisource remote sensing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Amazon Forest, the largest contiguous tropical forest in the world, stores a significant fraction of the carbon on land. Changes in climate and land use affect total carbon stocks, making it critical to continuously update and revise the best estimates for the region, particularly considering changes in forest dynamics. Forest inventory data cover only a tiny fraction of the Amazon region, and the coverage is not sufficient to ensure reliable data interpolation and validation. This paper presents a new forest above-ground biomass map for the Brazilian Amazon and the associated uncertainty both with a resolution of 250 meters and baseline for the satellite dataset the year of 2016 (i.e., the year of the satellite observation). A significant increase in data availability from forest inventories and remote sensing has enabled progress towards high-resolution biomass estimates. This work uses the largest airborne LiDAR database ever collected in the Amazon, mapping 360,000 km2 through transects distributed in all vegetation categories in the region. The map uses airborne laser scanning (ALS) data calibrated by field forest inventories that are extrapolated to the region using a machine learning approach with inputs from Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), vegetation indices obtained from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, and precipitation information from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). A total of 174 field inventories geolocated using a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) were used to validate the biomass estimations. The experimental design allowed for a comprehensive representation of several vegetation types, producing an above-ground biomass map varying from a maximum value of 518 Mg ha-1, a mean of 174 Mg ha-1, and a standard deviation of 102 Mg ha-1. This unique dataset enabled a better representation of the regional distribution of the forest biomass and structure, providing further studies and critical information for decision-making concerning forest conservation, planning, carbon emissions estimate, and mechanisms for supporting carbon emissions reductions.

TI  - GIS-BASED LANDSLIDE VULNERABILITY MAPPING ALONG THE SUMATRAN FAULT: A CASE STUDY IN PASAMAN REGENCY, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the influence of geological characteristics, land cover, slope levels, and rainfall intensity on landslide susceptibility. The study investigates the impact of the Sumatran Fault's active segments on geological instability and examines how human activities and climatic factors contribute to landslide risks. A quantitative approach integrates geological conditions, slope analysis, land cover classification, and rainfall data, validated through field testing. Data sources include geological maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2024, and historical rainfall records. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm and overlay analysis facilitated the identification of landslide-prone zones. The results reveal that igneous rocks dominate 41 % of the area, followed by sedimentary (33 %) and metamorphic rocks (25 %), with steep slopes (24-45%) covering 39 %. Annual rainfall exceeds 1500 mm, with areas receiving >2500 mm constituting 46 % of the region. These factors, combined with deforestation and unsustainable land practices, heighten landslide risks, particularly in the western fault zone. High vulnerability areas account for 13 % of the region, concentrated in steep and fault-affected zones, while medium-vulnerability zones dominate at 86 %. The study concludes that Pasaman Regency requires integrated strategies, including slope stabilization, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices, to mitigate landslide risks. Infrastructure resilience, community-based disaster management, and climate adaptation measures are critical for reducing socioeconomic impacts and enhancing environmental sustainability. The findings provide actionable insights for disaster risk reduction and land-use planning, emphasizing the interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors in landslide vulnerability.

TI  - Sediment source fingerprints of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures: A contribution to manage the Paraopeba River basin impacted by the B1 tailings dam collapse
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the origins of sediment transport in river systems is crucial for effective watershed management, especially after catastrophic events. This information is essential for the development of integrated strategies that guarantee water security in river basins. The present study aimed to investigate the rupture of the B1 tailings dam of the C <acute accent>orrego do Feija o mine, which drastically affected the Brumadinho region (Minas Gerais, Brazil). To address this issue, a confluence-based sediment fingerprinting approach was developed through the SedSAT model. Uncertainty was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Estimates of the overall average contributions of each tributary were quantified for each station and annually during the period 2019 - 2021. It was observed that the sampling point PT-09, closest to the dam breach, contributed to almost 80% of the Paraopeba River in 2019. Despite the dredging efforts, this percentage increased to 90% in 2020 due to the need to restore the highly degraded area. Additionally, the main tributaries contributing to sediment increase in the river are Manso River " TT-03 " (almost 36%), associated with an area with a high percentage of urban land use, and Cedro stream " TT-07 " (almost 71%), whose geology promotes erosion, leading to higher sediment concentration. Uncertainties arise from the limited number of available tracers, variations caused by dredging activities, and reduced data in 2020 due to the pandemic. Parameters such as land use, riparian vegetation degradation, downstream basin geology, and increased precipitation are key factors for successfully assessing tributary contributions to the Paraopeba River. The obtained results are promising for a preliminary analysis, allowing the quantification of key areas due to higher erosion and studying how this disaster affected the watershed. This information is crucial for improving decision-making, environmental governance, and the development of mitigating measures to ensure water security. This study is pioneering in evaluating this methodology in watersheds affected by environmental disasters, where restoration efforts are ongoing.

TI  - Phylogenetic distance controls plant growth during early restoration of a semi-arid riparian forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little attention has been paid to phylogenetic diversity during restoration initiatives. Because plant phylogenetic distance can be a surrogate for functional diversity, its consideration could foster the restoration of degraded areas. This study investigates the influence of species richness and phylogenetic relatedness during early restoration of a riparian forest located between the Atlantic Forest and semi-arid ecosystems in NE Brazil. The restoration experiment was established along a perennial stream in Monte Alegre, RN, investigating the significance of species richness and phylogenetic diversity for sapling survival and growth of the restored communities. We used phylogenetic information on 47 tree species naturally occurring at the study site. The resulting phylogenetic tree had a basal node with three major clades. To implement the experiment, three species from each clade were randomly selected, resulting in nine species (from five families). We defined five levels of diversity: (i) no planting, (ii) monoculture, (iii) three phylogenetically related species (same clade), (iv) three phylogenetically distant species (different clades) and (v) nine species. The experiment consisted of 96 (12 m x 10 m) plots established along the two margins of the stream. Overall, 1656 saplings (20-50 cm) were planted in September 2015 (184 per species). We tested whether the survival and growth of saplings are influenced by the number of species planted and phylogenetic distance among them. We assessed plant mortality and growth during two consecutive years (2016 and 2017). Survival was lower but relative growth was higher for plants near the stream. After controlling for differences in initial size, plots with phylogenetically distant species produced significantly taller plants, but only when occurring near the stream. Diversity treatments did not influence plant survival, while initial size determined plant survival and growth. Our findings show that greater phylogenetic distance led to increased plant growth, probably, because of the presence of functionally divergent species that use resources in a complementary way. Therefore, plant phylogenetic relatedness should be considered during the design of restored communities to improve the outcomes of future restoration initiatives.

TI  - Quick qualitative and quantitative changes in reproductive efforts in an open cerrado community: An explorative study of fire-stimulated species
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is a tropical savanna hotspot that is impacted by frequent wildfires, but where many effects of fire still are poorly understood. This is especially true for the herbaceous strata at the community level, in which reproductive efforts are deeply affected by fire. The objectives of this study were the following: evaluate if fire qualitatively and/or quantitatively affects the production of sexual reproductive structures in an open cerrado community; describe fire-stimulated or fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species; and evaluate the influence of water availability on flowering and fruiting. The number of species with flowers and fruits/m(2) and the number of reproductive units/m(2) were sampled in eight 20x20 m(2) plots in Chapada Diamantina, Brazil. After the first sampling in the beginning of the rainy season (November 2009), the vegetation in four plots was burned and then the eight plots were resampled over five months. Indexes of fire-stimulated and fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species were calculated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cross-correlation analyses were calculated and differences between the burnt and unburnt plots were compared with an analysis of variance. Sexual reproduction was deeply affected by fire, which changed the composition of reproducing species. Profuse reproduction of graminoids (Poaceae) and geophytic herbs classified as fire-stimulated flowering and/or firestimulated fruiting species concomitantly occurred with a high increase of water in the burnt soil compared to the unburnt soil in the first two months after the fires. The sexual reproduction of shrubby species was inhibited by fire. In an objective way, 21 species stimulated or inhibited by fire were recorded. Fire also changed the influence of rainfall on reproductive efforts. This study shows quick qualitative and quantitative effects of fire on open cerrado functioning and highlights the necessity of fire management for biodiversity conservation in savannas.

TI  - Emergence and establishment of native and non-native species in soils of remnant and converted highland grasslands - southern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Native grasslands in the Campos de Cima da Serra, Brazil, are being converted at speed for exotic tree plantations and cropland. The impact of modified and novel soil conditions on the establishment of native grassland species is unknown; establishment of non-native species, deliberately or accidentally introduced, could be favoured. In a common garden composed of fully randomized replicate samples of soils collected from remnant grassland, former cropland and pine plantations, we tested emergence and establishment of five cold-season species: Native low-tussock grass Piptochaetium montevidense (Spreng.) Parodi; native legume Trifolium riograndense Burkart; naturalized low-tussock grass Vulpia bromoides (L.) Gray; low-tussock grass Holcus lanatus L., cultivated and naturalized in Brazil; and a cultivar of non-native Trifolium repens. Other than expected, soil type and species*soil type interactions had no significant effect on seedling emergence after 132 days in the field. Species effect on seedling emergence, however, was highly significant. Vulpia bromoides emergence was significantly highest in all soil types. Holcus lanatus and Trifolium riograndense both achieved second highest emergence rates and did not differ significantly from each other. Lowest overall emergence rates were found in the non-native clover cultivar. Lab germination tests failed for Piptochaetium, although it showed reasonable emergence in the field. Good performance of the native clover is encouraging for future grassland restoration, but the value of highly germinable Vulpia as a forage remains to be tested. Holcus tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and its life history traits may promote naturalization, or even invasiveness. Native grasslands of the region should be monitored for this species. Studies like these, but set up on a larger geographical scale and with a wider array of native species, will be essential in developing ecological restoration methods for southern Brazilian grasslands.

TI  - Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (> 24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (% WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and % WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

TI  - Quantifying Forest Cover Loss during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Lubumbashi Charcoal Production Basin (DR Congo) through Remote Sensing and Landscape Analysis
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the Lubumbashi Charcoal Production Basin (LCPB), the socio-economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated pressures on populations dependent on forest resources for their subsistence. This study employs a comprehensive methodological approach, integrating advanced remote sensing techniques, including image classification, mapping, and detailed landscape analysis, to quantify alterations in forest cover within the LCPB during the pandemic period. Our findings reveal a consistent trend of declining forested area, characterized by processes of attrition and dissection observed throughout various study phases, spanning from May 2019 to November 2023. This reduction in forest cover, notably more pronounced in the vicinity of Lubumbashi city and the northern zone of the LCPB, proved to be less pronounced between November 2019 and September 2020, underscoring the influence of COVID-19 pandemic-induced confinement measures on forest management practices in the region. However, subsequent to this period of restriction, deforestation activity intensified, leading to significant landscape transformations within the LCPB, primarily attributable to expanded human activities, consequently resulting in a notable decrease in the proportion of land occupied by these natural ecosystems. Consequently, the size of the largest forest patch declined substantially, decreasing from 14.62% to 8.20% between May 2019 and November 2023, thereby fostering a heightened density of forest edges over time. Our findings provide a significant contribution to understanding the complex interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and deforestation phenomena, emphasizing the urgent need to adopt adaptive management strategies and appropriate conservation measures in response to current economic challenges.

TI  - Benefits of Combining ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A Data in the Classification of Land Cover Classes in the Santa Catarina Southern Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Santa Catarina Southern Plateau is located in Southern Brazil and is a region that has gained considerable attention due to the rapid conversion of the typical landscape of natural grasslands and wetlands into agriculture, reforestation, pasture, and more recently, wind farms. This study's main goal was to characterize the polarimetric attributes of the experimental quad-polarization acquisition mode of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR-2) for mapping seven land cover classes. The polarimetric attributes were evaluated alone and combined with SENTINEL-2A using a supervised classification method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The results showed that the intensity backscattering alone reached an overall classification accuracy of 37.48% and a Kappa index of 0.26. Interestingly, the addition of polarimetric features increased to 71.35% and 0.66, respectively. It shows that the use of polarimetric decomposition features was relatively efficient in discriminating land cover classes. SENTINEL-2A data alone performed better and achieved a weighted overall accuracy and Kappa index of 85.56% and 0.82. This increase was also significant for the Z-test. However, the addition of ALOS/PALSAR-2 derived features to SENTINEL-2A slightly improved accuracy and was marginally significant at a 95% confidence level only when all features were considered. Possible implications for that performance are the accumulated precipitation prior to SAR data acquisition, which coincides with the rainy season period. The experimental quad-polarization mode of ALOS/PALSAR- 2 shall be evaluated in the near future over different seasonal conditions to confirm results. Alternatively, further studies are then suggested by focusing on additional features derived from SAR data such as texture and interferometric coherence to increase classification accuracy. These measures would be an interesting data source for monitoring specific land cover classes such as the threatened grasslands and wetlands during periods of frequent cloud coverage. Future investigations could also address multitemporal approaches employing either single or multifrequency SAR.

TI  - Meta-analysis reveals benefits of co-inoculation of soybean with Azospirillum brasilense and Bradyrhizobium spp. in Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-inoculation of soybean with Azospirillum brasilense and Bradyrhizobium spp. is an increasing practice in Brazil, but little is known about the conditions that maximize crop efficiency. In this study, data from field experiments run between 2009 and 2020 in Brazil were gathered to evaluate which environmental and agronomic conditions affect the response of soybean to bacterial co-inoculation. Results showed that co-inoculation of soybean increased root mass in 11%, nodule number in 5.4%, nodule mass in 10.6%, N concentration in shoots in 2.8%, grain yield and N concentration in grains in 3.2% and 3.6% respectively compared to the conventional single inoculation with Bradyrhizobium spp. Grain yield was used to discriminate co-inoculation efficiency, and soybean was more responsive to the simultaneous inoculation with B. japonicum and B. diazoefficiens in sandy soils, nontillage system, tropical climate, soybean cultivars with determinate growth habit, and grain yield class lower than 3500 kg ha-1. Co-inoculation can also be important to mitigate the effects of water stress on plants. Coinoculation of soybean with A. brasilense and Bradyrhizobium spp. demonstrated to be an efficient technology that contributes to the sustainability of soybean production.

TI  - Revealing the Bacteriome in Crop-Livestock-Forest Integration Systems in the Cerrado of MATOPIBA, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable agriculture relies on effective soil management, making it crucial to assess soil health, especially in areas of agricultural expansion, such as the Cerrado in the MATOPIBA region. Sustainable strategies, such as integrated production systems (crop-livestock-forestry), are essential to mitigate these impacts. However, little is known about the effects of these systems on soil microbial communities. The objective of this study was to evaluate bacterial communities associated with soils under different integrated production systems in the MATOPIBA region. Soil samples from the 0-10 cm depth layer were collected from the following land use systems: (i) native Cerrado vegetation (NCV), (ii) native Babassu forest (NPV), (iii) no-tillage soybean-regional standard system (NT-S), (iv) crop-forest integration (CFI), (v) crop-livestock integration (CLI), and (vi) livestock-forest integration (LFI). We measured chemical properties and bacterial communities using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The results revealed that the integration systems (CFI, CLI, and LFI) resulted in changes in soil chemical properties, which contributed to the modulation of the bacterial communities. The most abundant taxa in integrated production systems shows a positive correlation with soil pH and phosphorus content. Members of the Nitrosomonadaceae and Sphingomonadaceae families are more related to integrated production systems containing a forestry component (CFI and LFI), while Bacillaceae are more evident in crop-livestock integration systems (CLI).

TI  - Our Hungry Neighbor: Self-Reported Data from Farmers' Perspective on Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Forest, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research AimsHuman-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers' awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans.MethodsWe used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.ResultsWe found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses.ConclusionThe study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives.Implications for ConservationThe study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers' perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region.

TI  - Evaluation of the PM2.5 concentrations in South America: Climatological and trend
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 (PM2.5) over South America (SA) based on climatological patterns and trend analysis. This study used monthly PM2.5 data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts from 2003 to 2022. The bilinear interpolation method was applied to the data resampling from 0.75 degrees x 0.75 degrees-0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, and subsequently, the climatological analysis was performed on seasonal and annual scales of PM2.5 concentrations for the 20-year series. The assessment comprised three main stages: 1) descriptive statistics, 2) seasonal and annual climatology patterns, and 3) trend analysis (Mann-Kendall - MK and Pettitt tests). Results indicated that the largest annual PM2.5 concentrations were found in the Amazon region and northern Paraguay due the El-Ni & ntilde;o South Oscillation events (2003-2005, 2007, 2010, 2020, and 2022). The annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the WHO recommended limit (5 mu g m(-3)), ranging from 15.57 mu g m(-3) (1999) and 22.74 mu g m(-3) (2007 and 2010). The highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in the Amazon and Chile (Santiago), reaching 160.4 mu g m(-3) annually and 177.8 mu g m(-3) seasonally (spring). Elevated seasonal PM2.5 concentrations were attributed to increased deforestation and wildfires associated with meteorological systems such as the Bolivian high and subtropical jets during dry periods (winter and spring). The MK test revealed a significant reduction in PM2.5 concentrations between 2003 and 2022, observed in Argentina (north), Brazil (arc of reforestation), Bolivia (south), and Chile (north). Reduction values varied between 0.5 and 10 mu g m(-3).year(-1) annually and during winter, attributed to no-tillage practices in regions cultivating commodities. The Pettitt test also identified significant structural changes occurring in 2006-2008 and 2010-2011, aligning with areas highlighted in the MK test. This study provides valuable insights for air quality and environmental monitoring managers to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in SA.

TI  - Litter addition as a tool for restoring hydrological processes and controlling erosion in riparian forests disturbed by fine sediment deposition
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverscape aggradation due to the deposition of fine particles above natural forest litter can change the soil, sediment, and water properties, damage riparian vegetation, and reduce environmental integrity, especially in headwater streams. Litter addition techniques that enhance surface roughness and permeability can decrease the interference of fine particles on the ecosystem, representing a low-tech alternative to recover disturbed riparian areas. We aimed to evaluate run-off, percolation, storage coefficients, run-off volume, and sediment yield using a rainfall simulator and the mitigation potential provided by the addition of forest litter to limnological variables-turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), electrical conductivity, pH, nitrogen-which are indicators of integrity that can reflect streams' aggradation. Fifteen soil samples from a disturbed area (silt and clay deposits aboveground), five from an undisturbed area (sandy soil), and superficial forest litter were obtained from riparian areas adjacent to two small streams in Carajas National Forest, Brazil. The addition of litter showed great potential to mitigate erosive processes and to reestablish hydrological processes in the disturbed soil. The run-off volume and sediment yield were 2-4 times lower in litter addition treatments compared to non-litter addition. Litter addition also improved run-off water quality, especially turbidity and TSS, which were 12-16 times and 3-13 times lower, respectively. The experimental addition of litter has shown encouraging results to be applied in situ as a sustainable, low-cost, and simplified nature-based solution to contribute to the restoration of degraded riparian forests and reduce in-stream silt and clay aggradation.

TI  - Measures for sustainable forest management in the tropics - A tree-ring based case study on tree growth and forest dynamics in a Central Amazonian lowland moist forest
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of tropical forests is recognized as one of the most important challenges for forestry, ecology and politics. Besides strict protection, the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods. Tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries. For tree ring analysis, stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species (Cariniana micrantha, Caryocar villosum and Manilkara huberi) in the upland (terra firme) forests of the Precious Woods Amazon logging company near Itacoatiara, Brazil. Based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones, the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species. Tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter, height and volume growth. The age of the eldest tree, a C. micrantha, was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter. The species' diameter increments range from 0.20 +/- 0.12 cm yr(-1) to 0.29 +/- 0.08 cm yr(-1). At first sight, this is considerably lower than increments reported from other Amazonian or African timber species. Considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents. The interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species, the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances. Management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the Brazilian standards fixed by laws (felling cycle of 25-35 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm). Felling cycles should be increased to 32-51 years and minimum logging diameters to 63-123 cm depending on the species.

TI  - Impact of the El Niño on Fire Dynamics on the African Continent
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies investigated the occurrence of fires in Africa with numerical modeling or applied statistics; however, only a few studies focused on the influence of El Nino on the fire risk using a coupled model. The study aimed to assess the influence of El Nino on wildfire dynamics in Africa using the SPEEDY-HYCOM model. El Nino events in the Eastern Tropical Pacific were classified via sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly based on a predefined climatology between 1961 and 2020 for the entire time series of SST, obtaining linear anomalies. The time series of the SST anomalies was created for the region between 5 degrees N and 5 degrees S and 110 degrees W and 170 degrees W. The events were defined in three consecutive 3-month periods as weak, moderate, and strong El Nino conditions. The Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) was applied to detect fire hazards. The MFDI simulated by the SPEEDY-HYCOM model for three El Nino categories across different lagged months revealed relevant distinctions among the categories. In the case of 'Weak', the maximum variability of fire risk observed at time lags (0, -3, -6, and -9 months) was primarily in Congo, Gabon, and Madagascar. The 'Moderate' pattern had similar characteristics to 'Weak' except for the lag-6 months and its occurrence in the equatorial zone of Africa. 'Strong' showed a remarkable impact in East Africa, resulting in high fire risk, regardless of time lags. Precipitation and evaporation simulations (SPEEDY-HYCOM) indicated that El Nino categories in Africa need particular attention in the central, southern, and southeastern regions emphasizing the significance of lag-0 and lag-6 (evaporation) as well as lag-0, lag-6, and lag-9 (precipitation). The SPEEDY-HYCOM coupled model in conjunction with the MFDI was efficient in assessing climate variabilities in Africa during El Nino events. This model allows the analysis and prediction of wildfire risks based on El Nino events, providing crucial information for wildfire management and prevention. Its simulations uncover significant variations in risks among different El Nino categories and lagged months, contributing to the understanding and mitigation of this environmental challenge.

TI  - Testing and Enhancing the 8R Framework of Responsible Land Management with Documented Strategies and Effects of Land Reclamation Projects in Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Whereas most contemporary frameworks evaluating land management aspects focus on institutional settings at a national level, the 8R framework of responsible land management aims at evaluating individual land management projects or interventions. This 8R framework is, however, still under development and needs testing, validation and further detailing, such that specific operational characteristics and internal and external effects can be included in the evaluation. This article addresses this need by demonstrating how the 8R framework could improve when knowing both the operational details and external effects of a land management intervention. By reviewing the documented implementation strategies and effects of eight different types of land reclamation cases in Indonesia, the article derives adaptations and extensions of the 8R framework assessment, such that the framework can better detect whether a specific project is sufficiently responsible in any of the 8R aspects. The induction shows that the number of types of systematic prompts needs to be extended and further detailed if it aims to capture and detect specific problems of structures, processes and impacts. Zooming in to documented reclamation projects in Indonesia shows that there are various types of such projects, which are oftentimes contested, yet each requires integrated land management and development strategies. Furthermore, they draw on dissimilar, mostly contextual, justifications and legal frameworks, which makes it difficult to compare the generic relevancy and sustainability of reclamation as a land management intervention tool. Nevertheless, testing the 8R framework for reclamation cases in Indonesia can improve its methodology and extent or specify the use of the systematic prompts designed to qualify and quantify the respective aspects.

TI  - The Effect of Climatic Conditions on the Seasonality of Pest Insect Populations in Eucalyptus Plantations in the Neotropics.
T2  - Neotropical Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp., Mirtaceae) stands out for its remarkable regeneration capacity, making it a valuable tool for recovering degraded areas and for reforestation. Despite its Australian origins, eucalyptus has shown remarkable adaptation to the Brazilian tropical climate, contributing to the wood productivity of the country. However, the extensive monoculture of eucalyptus can increase pest incidence, thus being a significant challenge for the forestry sector, which suffers production losses of up to 30%. We analyzed the occurrence of 11 pest insect species in 450 eucalyptus stands over 9 years in the southeastern region of Brazil in our study. We related pest occurrences to specific year periods and climatic variations using circular uniformity analysis and zero-inflated models. We found that the species generally had isolated peaks of occurrence during the year and that the increase in the occurrence of at least five species was related to temperature or precipitation. The results highlight the sensitivity of pests to climatic conditions, showing the importance of management strategies to ensure the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations. We can develop more effective management strategies by understanding how these variables interact with insect populations, contributing to the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations with less aggressive environmental practices.

TI  - Floristic and functional identity of rupestrian grasslands as a subsidy for environmental restoration and policy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique vegetation of rupestrian grassland (Campo Rupestre) is finely tuned to the strong environmental and edaphoclimatic filters that resulted in important adaptations and high levels of endemism. In this study, we intend to give another focus to the understanding of the identity of the rupestrian grasslands by observing their floristic relationships with other surrounding vegetation types and to present for the first time a functional approach and zeta similarity to try to understand the differences and similarities of this ecosystem with other adjacent ones. We have compiled 1790 plant species in 7 vegetation types. Based on the species composition, we can infer that the most similar vegetation types were Tepuis and Altitudinal Grasslands, and this group is closer to Inselbergs. Subsequently, the most similar were Ironstone Grasslands and the Atlantic Forest grouped with Quartzite Grasslands. Finally, Cerrado was the lesser similar. But, these groupings are modified when analyzed at genus or family level. Considering the zeta diversity decline at the species level, the vegetation types showed an almost complete turnover in species assemblage, sharing only a small suite of species between them. This pattern is similar at the genus level, but the number of genera shared across vegetation types is comparatively higher. On the other hand, at the family level, there is a common core of families shared between vegetation types. When we evaluated the similarity considering functional attributes we found differences in composition regarding growth and life forms. However, in this case, Quartzitic and Ironstone Rupestrian Grasslands showed very similar functional attributes. They are inhabited by plant species with shrub, epiphytic, parasitic and succulent forms with rupicolous growth form. In general, the quartzitic grasslands have singular vegetation, but its affinity with other vegetation types does not translate in any way the most relevant aspects associated with endemism and biodiversity. The true landscape identity to a certain ecosystem is given by functional characteristics.

TI  - The importance of conspecific facilitation during recruitment and regeneration: A case study in degraded mangroves
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Facilitation can affect positively the survival, growth and fitness of neighboring plants and is able to promote the establishment of plant species under harsh environmental conditions. This study is one of the few to focus on conspecific nurse plants enabling the establishment of tree followers and the generally unknown interplay between facilitation and competition during recruitment and establishment.Field studies were conducted in an hypersaline area in north Brazil where the hydrological regime was disturbed by road construction in 1974. Avicennia germinans shrubs were able to recolonize subareas.Three different stages of re-colonization were identified by satellite imagery based on the vegetation coverage and were defined as the early, middle, and late stages. Different plant parameters, including height and crown radius of individual trees, were measured, and all plants separating mangrove seedlings and larger plants were stem-mapped.The Hegyi index was adapted to measure local interaction intensity, considering both positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) interactions among neighboring plants. Spatial point pattern analyses were combined with the interaction index to obtain a better overview of the strength and importance of the plant interactions within the different recolonizing stages.The spatial patterns displayed aggregation for all plants in all developmental stages. This is supported by the interaction index calculated for seedlings. The index, however, provides an early signal for the switching of plant interactions from facilitation to competition as the developmental stage increased. This feature remains undetected in the spatial patterns because self-thinning processes are linked to individual growth processes and require more time to take place.This study broadens the ecological concept of nurse plants from hetero- to conspecific, including the importance and strength of plant interactions. The studied degraded areas are recolonizing naturally, and conclusions can be drawn for restoration projects, which usually do not take facilitation effects into account.

TI  - Rubber-Based Agroforestry Systems Associated with Food Crops: A Solution for Sustainable Rubber and Food Production?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry is often seen as a sustainable land-use system for agricultural production providing ecosystem services. Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops.

TI  - Synchronous reinforcement azo dyes decolorization and anaerobic granular sludge stability by Fe, N co-modified biochar: Enhancement based on extracellular electron transfer
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment of azo dyes wastewater often suffers from low decolorization efficiency and poor stability of anaerobic granular sludge (AnGS). In this study, iron and nitrogen co-modified biochar (FNC) was synthesized based on the secondary calcination method, and the feasibility of this material for enhanced AD treatment of azo dye wastewater and its mechanism were investigated. FNC not only formed richer conducting functional groups, but also generated Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs. The decolorization efficiency of Congo red and AD properties (e.g., methane production) were enhanced by FNC. After adding FNC, the content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the ratio of proteins remained stable under the impact of Congo red, which greatly protected the internal microbial community. This was mainly contributed to the excellent electrochemical properties of FNC, which strengthened the microbial extracellular electron transfer and realized the coupled mechanism of action: On the one hand, an electron transfer bridge between decolorizing bacteria and dyes was constructed to achieve rapid decolorization of azo dyes and mitigate the impact on methanogenic bacteria; On the other hand, the stability of AnGS was enhanced based on enhanced extracellular polymeric substances secretion, microbial community and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) process. This study provides a new idea for enhanced AD treatment of azo dyes wastewater.

TI  - Rainfall interception and partitioning in afromontane rain forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania: Implications for water conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground components of the hydrologic cycle of rain forest are important processes that determine the hydrologic behaviour and dynamics of these ecosystems. Precipitation, throughfall, stem flow, canopy interception and streamflow were measured and modelled in two afromontane rain forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. Measurements were made daily for 50 months in the Ulugurus and 56 months in the Usambaras. Throughfall was 76% of the gross rainfall in the Usambaras and 79% in the Ulugurus. Stemflow was less than 2% of rainfall. Both parameters were correlated with gross. rainfall (r(2) = 0.97, 0.99, 0.86 and 0.94). Canopy interception was 22% of rainfall for the Usambaras and 20% for the Ulugurus. Streamflow was best modelled using five months running mean rainfall in the Ulugurus (r = 0.67) and three to four months in the Usambaras (r = 0.72). A high proportion of the gross rainfall is delivered as net precipitation. There is effective partitioning of rainfall on the forest canopy providing reasonable dumping effect of rainstorms. The slow response in streamflow to rainfall events shows the efficiency of the forests to mitigate storm water impacts and thus ensuring continuous water supply. Further studies in effects of forest harvesting on water yield are pertinent to enable adequate planning of forest utilization.

TI  - A review of patterns and geographical distribution of human-wildlife conflicts in Indonesia.
T2  - Berkala Penelitian Hayati
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented growth of human-dominated landscapes has led to population decline and the extinction of many animal species. A major paradigm shift that perceived wildlife as problem animals into threatened species that need protection triggered human-wildlife conflict studies. Although humanwildlife conflict incidences can be found globally, they have unique characteristics in each region of the world. However, little is known about the characteristics of human-wildlife conflicts in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. There is a need for a comprehensive insight into human-wildlife conflict studies in Indonesia to understand past advancements and propose future priorities. This study examined the literature that provides the overall view of the human-wildlife conflict patterns in the country. The results showed that there was a comparatively small number of studies because this field was a relatively new subject in Indonesia. Furthermore, there were big gaps regarding animal species and the geographic distribution of study sites. A total of 35 species belonging to eight taxonomic groups experienced conflicts with humans. However, the studies heavily focused on three groups of animals and certain areas of the country. The predominant conflict sites were secondary forest, agroforestry, and farmlands. The conflicts in these areas unveiled the significance of local beliefs and social norms for formulating mitigation strategies.

TI  - Resistance to weathering and color stability of thermally modified eucalypts wood for deck
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - When considering the diversity of tropical woods present in Brazil, used commercially, few are used for the production of floors, especially for decks. As a result of the disorderly exploitation of native tropical species, wood from reforestation, especially those of the Eucalyptus genus, have been used in order to meet demand. However, some properties of these woods need to be improved, such as the dimensional and color stability of wood when exposed to environmental conditions. Therefore, heat treatments are suggested, which can add qualities in order to serve the market. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of accelerated weathering in thermally modified Eucalyptus clone woods for decking (with and without stain application), in order to improve the technological properties of wood, to add value to products and to expand its use. To this end, wood from 14-year-old eucalypts hybrid clones was used to meet the production of deck. For this purpose, three clones (A, C and E) were used, two wood heat treatment temperatures (185 and 200 degrees C) and compared to the control. Since, the thermally modified wood becomes dark, which can be seen as a commercially attractive feature to produce floors. Eucalypts wood is not used to produce flooring, especially decks, and this could increase the use of this wood in the market. Therefore, the measurement of color and accelerated weathering were performed on samples with and without stain application, in three moments, these being, before weathering, after 168 h of weathering (seven days of exposure) and after 336 h (fourteen days of exposure). Finished woods were more resistant to accelerated weathering, in which heat treatment at 185 degrees C, for wood from eucalypts clones and clone A, promoted better changes in resistance to accelerated weathering and color uniformity, allowing its use in low circulation floors, such as decks.

TI  - Weed control, large seeds and deep roots: Drivers of success in direct seeding for savanna restoration
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We aimed to evaluate the performance of native tree species in the restoration of savanna vegetation by direct seeding, to assess whether weed control and intercropping with native grasses can contribute to the success of this method and to determine whether species performance can be explained by functional traits.Location Cerrado biome, southeastern Brazil. Old fields abandoned after decades of land use as pasture or croplands, occupied by ruderal plants and invasive grasses.Methods We established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species native to the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region. We used a factorial design in five blocks, with the following factors: (a) species; (b) weed control and (c) intercropping with native grasses. We evaluated the emergence, survival and growth of plants, and through multiple regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct seeding based on their functional traits.Results Emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species but with little or no difference between treatments. Growth was compromised by weed competition in all species. Intercropping with native grasses did not decrease weed competition. We found a functional pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding, where survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass, root depth and a greater root:shoot ratio.Conclusion Weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival, considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding. The success of this method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root system. Characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Heterogeneity by Logging Intensity in a Federal Concession Area in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The logging intensity often does not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the forest volume of commercial native species in the Brazilian Amazon. This study aims to evaluate the spatio-temporal heterogeneity distribution by assessing logging intensity and its effects on the volumetric stock and abundance of commercial species, with a focus on sustainable management practices. This study was conducted in the Sarac & aacute;-Taquera National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Forest inventory data, elevation, and PlanetScope satellite images were integrated into a geographic information system. The information was aggregated into regular 1-hectare cells for the times before, during, and after logging (t0, t1, and t2). The unsupervised classification algorithm k-means with four clusters was used to analyze heterogeneity. Before logging, areas with higher commercial volumes were distant from water bodies, while areas with lower elevation had lower wood stocks. Logging intensity was generally low, concentrating on a few trees per hectare. Logging in the study area revealed a heterogeneous spatial distribution by intensifying in areas with the highest wood stocks. These results suggest that, in addition to the recommended logging intensity according to legislation, forest heterogeneity should be considered by the manager, promoting adaptive strategies to ensure the conservation of forest resources.

TI  - Participatory multicriteria assessment of maize cropping systems in the context of family farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is recognized as a promising crop management strategy for sustainable agricultural intensification. The objective of this study was to evaluate CA cropping systems for rainfed maize as an alternative to the traditional tillage-based cropping systems (CT) in the context of family farms, using a multi-criteria model that represents the point of view of farmers. Farmers considered several aspects for evaluating the cropping systems, thatwere systematized in the model through five criteria (with sub-criteria): (a) costs; (b) yield; (c) labour; (d) human health and environment; and (e) production risks. CA did not differ from CT for the 'costs' criterion but was superior for the 'yield' and 'labour' criteria. In contrast, CT obtained better ratings for the criteria 'human health and environment' and 'production risks'. Considering all criteria, CA was better appraised than CT. However, a new local policy measure that subsidizes the hiring of mechanized tillage services overturns this outcome, indicating the importance of exogenous factors. Overall, the participatory processes in building the model allowed us to better understand the reasons of adoption or non-adoption of CA by small-scale farmers in the tropics.

TI  - Deep furrow and additional liming for coffee cultivation under first year in a naturally dense inceptisol
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Naturally dense soils have been commonly managed for coffee plantations in Vertentes Fields physiographic zone of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Such dense soils in association with the irregular rainfall in recent years have increased risks for crop productivity. Therefore, management practices aiming at improving subsoil root exploration have been recommended for enhancing absorption of water and nutrient uptake, thus mitigating the edaphic drought process and ensuring the development, productivity, and longevity of the coffee crop. A field experiment was carried out in an area of dense Inceptisols through the planting of the coffee crop to investigate the effect of deep furrowing with additional liming on soil quality indexes and as a function of normalized pore distribution by volume [S*(h)]. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 5 treatments: 40 (conventional soil preparation with furrows at 0.40 m of depth); 60 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.60 m of depth with conventional (60S) and complementary liming application (60C)); 80 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.80 m of depth with conventional (80S) and complementary liming application (80C)). These treatments were compared to an area under native Cerrado vegetation. Undisturbed soil samples were collected at different depths in each treatment. On these samples, water content was measured at different matrix potentials, and physical quality indicators along with the S*(h) were calculated. The results indicated that soil management practices, compared to the native condition, promoted a better distribution of water and air (P-AWC, RFC, P-MAC and S index) as well S*(h) up to 0.40 m. Below this depth, none of the management practices were able to promote significant improvements (p < 0.05) of these variables in relation to the soil native condition. The 80C treatment had the best air and water availability, with increased of pore size class having functions of drainage and aeration. Moreover, this treatment stood out in comparison to the conventional management (40) for all measured variables, maintaining the adequate conditions of the native area in depth. For the managed areas, the depth of 0.60 m gave the best improved growth and vegetative vigor of the coffee plants.

TI  - Soil Phosphorus Bioavailability and Soybean Grain Yield Impaired by Ruzigrass
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Under no-till farming systems, the use of crop rotations with species adapted to low P soils may enhance soil P availability through P cycling. Growing ruzigrass [Urochloa ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Morrone and Zuloaga] as a cover crop has shown to increase resin extractable P in soils. However, it is not clear how the next crop responds to ruzigrass in the long term. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effect of growing ruzigrass on soil P availability to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The evaluations were performed over 5 yr on a ruzigrass-soybean crop rotation, in Botucatu, Brazil. The treatments were P rates (0, 13, and 26 kg ha(-1)) applied to soybean seed furrows, and ruzigrass or fallow during the off-season. Soil samples were taken after ruzigrass desiccation, and soil P was extracted with resin (P-resin). The use of ruzigrass increased soil organic matter (SOM) by approximately 20% compared with fallow, regardless of P rates, and increased Presin concentration in the 0- to 10-cm soil depth by approximately 10% with 26 kg ha(-1) of P. Surprisingly, grain yield and soybean leaf P concentration were lower after ruzigrass compared with fallow. Resin seemed to be unsuitable to compare P availability in different cropping systems. In the long-term, growing ruzigrass as a cover crop in the off-season decreases P and N availability to soybean, eventually decreasing soybean grain yield. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms involved in this unexpected soybean response when cropped in rotation with ruzigrass.

TI  - Ten principles for restoring campo rupestre, a threatened tropical, megadiverse, nutrient-impoverished montane grassland
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve the ambitious goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, restoration frameworks should embrace the diversity of ecosystems found on Earth, including open-canopy ecosystems, which have been largely overlooked. Considering the paucity of scientific foundations promoting restoration science, policy, and practice for open tropical ecosystems, we provide overarching guidelines to restore the campo rupestre, a Neotropical, open megadiverse grassland that has been increasingly threatened by multiple human activities, especially mining. Restoration techniques for tropical grasslands are still at its infancy, and attempts to restore campo rupestre have had, so far, low to moderate success, highlighting the need for a tailored restoration framework. In a scenario of increasing degradation and scarcity of on-site restoration experiments, we propose 10 principles to improve our ability to plan, implement, and monitor restoration in campo rupestre: (1) include socioeconomic dimensions, (2) implement active restoration, (3) keep low soil fertility, (4) restore disturbance regimes, (5) address genetic structure and adaptation potential, (6) restore geographically restricted and specialized ecological interactions, (7) incorporate functional approaches, (8) use seed-based restoration strategies to enhance biodiversity, (9) translocation is inevitable, and (10) long-term monitoring is mandatory. Our principles represent the best available evidence to support better science and practice for the restoration of campo rupestre and, to some extent, can be useful for other megadiverse, fire-prone, and nutrient-poor ecosystems.

TI  - Land degradation affects the microbial communities in the Brazilian Caatinga biome
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that global land degradation and desertification are increasing nowadays, understanding how soil microbial communities are modulated by these drivers is of paramount importance to mitigate these processes. Here, we assessed the effect of land degradation, restoration, and native forest on soil microbial communities in a semiarid region from Northeastern Brazil. Thus, soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm depth, in three sites: native, degraded, and restored lands. The soil DNA was extracted, and the microbial community was assessed by next-generation sequencing through the Illumina platform. The composition of microbial communities and their potential functions were altered by the degradation process, thereby decreasing microbial diversity. Also, the changes in the microbial communities seem to be related to soil chemical alterations, which were changed by the process of degradation and restoration. Land degradation led to a loss of diversity and functions, and the restored area presented more resilience, which suggests that the microbial communities could recover their functions by adopting sustainable practices. Importantly, degraded lands reduced functions related to chemoheterotrophic metabolism, which can strongly impact carbon dynamics in the system. Finally, this study provided relevant evidence that land restoration practices can recover soil functions, which is extremely relevant for further research that is aimed at the development of sustainable practices in degradation hotspots around the world.

TI  - The inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soil amended with swine slurry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RECYCLING OF ORGANIC WASTE IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of the tillage system and consecutive application of swine slurry for seven years on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and infective propagules in Brazilian soil with crop rotation. Method: The spore density, the external mycelium, and the most probable number of infective propagules of mycorrhizal fungal abundance were assessed in soil samples from an Oxisol in a long-term field experiment in response to soil management (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and following successive application of swine slurry (0, 30, 60, 90 and Results: A greater amount of external mycelium was observed in soil under no-tillage, while mycorrhizal fungal abundance spore density was greater in soil under conventional tillage. In soil under no-tillage, mycorrhizal fungal abundance infective propagules were more abundant; however, in soil with both management systems, this variable was reduced with different levels of swine slurry application. In no-tillage, the main source of mycorrhizal fungal abundance propagules is the external mycelium, while in conventional tillage, the main inoculum component is the spores. Conclusion: In this study, we verified that the application of swine slurry, with high phosphorus contents, reduces arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi propagules. However, these effects are mitigated in no-tillage systems compared to conventional tillage.

TI  - BIRDS OF TWO PROTECTED AREAS IN THE SOUTHERN RANGE OF THE BRAZILIAN ARAUCARIA FOREST
T2  - Papeis Avulsos de Zoologia (Sao Paulo)
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 70% of threatened birds in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, inhabit forest environments. The creation and maintenance of protected areas is one of the most important measures aiming to mitigate these problems. However, the knowledge of the local biodiversity is essential so that these areas can effectively preserve the natural resources. Between 2004 and 2009 we sampled the avifauna in two conservation units in Rio Grande do Sul: Floresta Nacional de Canela (FNC) and Parque Natural Municipal da Ronda (PMR), both representative of the Mixed Humid Forest (Araucaria Forest). A total of 224 species was recorded, 116 at FNC and 201 at PMR, ten of which threatened regionally: Pseudastur polionotus, Odontophorus capueira, Patagioenas cayennensis, Amazona pretrei, A. vinacea, Triclaria malachitacea, Campephilus robustus, Grallaria varia, Procnias nudicollis and Sporophila melanogaster. Richness and species composition seem to be related to different stages of forest conservation, to size and connectivity, as well as to the diversity of environments. The better conservation of PAIR compared to FNC, allied to its geographic position, results in a richer avifauna, with a larger amount of rare and endangered species, as well as species sensitive to disturbance and endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest. We suggest management actions aiming the conservation and the long-term recovery of natural environments at these sites.

TI  - Bringing Fire Back: How Prescribed Fires Shape Ant Communities in a Fire-Suppressed Neotropical Savanna
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of different fire regimes on the ground-ant community from a savanna (Cerrado) reserve in southern Brazil, where a process of woody encroachment has been taking place. Ants are a dominant faunal group in tropical savannas. Over similar to 8 years, experimental plots were protected from fire or burned every one or two years. An additional treatment (adaptive) included annual fires and a reduction in woody biomass to increase fuel loads. Ants were collected prior to the first prescribed fire and again four times. We expected that fire would increase the diversity and overall abundance of open-savanna ant specialists, depending on the extent of changes in vegetation structure. Changes in litter depth, grass cover and bare ground in burned plots were most evident 88 months after the first fire and did not differ between fire regimes. Similarly, overall ant species richness and occurrence neither differed between fire treatments nor from the control. However, burned plots showed a significant increase in the richness and occurrence of open savanna specialists, and a decrease in species most typical of dense savanna or dry forests. As ant responses did not differ between the annual, biennial, and adaptive treatments, we suggest that a fire return interval of two years is enough for reverting the loss of open savanna ant specialists in areas that have been protected from fire for decades.

TI  - Risk and resilience: a review of functional traits influencing fire vulnerability in Pantanal mammals.
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, the Brazilian Pantanal experienced unprecedented wildfires that burned approximately 40,000 km2 and resulted in the death of an estimated 17 million vertebrates. This catastrophic event, characterized by an extreme fire behavior and large extension facilitated by a combination of accumulated organic matter and a prolonged drought, has highlighted both the acute vulnerability of the Pantanal's ecosystem to seasonal wildfires and the need for a comprehensive understanding of their potential effects on species and ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the vulnerability of mammals to wildfires in the Pantanal, focusing on the analysis of fire vulnerability traits and the spatial distribution of species. We reviewed a total of 2,868 studies published since 1938, focused on the physical attributes, behavioral patterns, and ecological dynamics of five mammalian orders: Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Didelphimorphia, Rodentia, and Perissodactyla. The analysis revealed a significant increase in research on fire vulnerability traits, particularly in carnivores, since the year 2000. The most studied traits include habitat preference, body size, and diet, while other critical traits for understanding fire sensitivity received less attention, such as reproductive season, mobility, social behavior and body size. Our findings highlight a marked seasonality in fire regimes and habitat specialization among the Pantanal's mammal species, with a concerning overlap between the 2019-2020 wildfires and the distribution of several species, suggesting potential severe declines in the abundance and distribution. These findings advocate for immediate conservation efforts targeting key habitats and refined wildfire management approaches to mitigate impacts, particularly on geographically restricted species. It also calls for a more balanced research focus across different taxa and traits to fully understand the ecological roles and vulnerabilities of less-studied species in the face of increasing fire frequencies and intensities in the Pantanal biome.

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation potential from green harvested sugarcane scenarios in Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is a major sugarcane producer and Sao Paulo State cultivates 5.5 million hectares, close to 50% of Brazil's sugarcane area. The rapid increase in production has brought into question the sustainability of biofuels, especially considering the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated to the agricultural sector. Despite the significant progress towards the green harvest practices, 1.67 million hectares were still burned in Sao Paulo State during the 2011 harvest season. Here an emissions inventory for the life cycle of sugarcane agricultural production is estimated using IPCC methodologies, according to the agriculture survey data and remote sensing database. Our hypothesis is that 1.67 million hectares shall be converted from burned to green harvest scenarios up to years 2021 (rate 1), 2014 (rate 2) or 2029 (rate 3). Those conversions would represent a significant GHG mitigation, ranging from 50.5 to 70.9 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO(2)eq) up to 2050, depending on the conversion rate and the green harvest systems adopted: conventional (scenario 51) or conservationist management (scenario S2). We show that a green harvest scenario where crop rotation and reduced soil tillage are practiced has a higher mitigation potential (70.9 Mt CO(2)eq), which is already practiced in some of the sugarcane areas. Here we support the decision to not just stop burning prior to harvest, but also to consider other better practices in sugarcane areas to have a more sustainable sugarcane based ethanol production in the most dense cultivated sugarcane region in Brazil.

TI  - Oil palm biomass in Indonesia: Thermochemical upgrading and its utilization
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is the world's largest palm oil producing country. The oil palm industry (plantation and milling) generates large amounts of solid waste in the form of empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS), mesocarp fiber (MF), oil palm fronds (OPF), and oil palm trunks (OPT). This leftover waste, collectively termed oil palm biomass (OPB), causes severe environmental pollution, thereby threatening the sustainability of the oil palm industry. Upgrading OPB by thermochemical processes (torrefaction and pyrolysis) has attracted significant interest as a means of recycling the residues and mitigating the environmental damage. This study reviews the previous research on the environment-friendly utilization of OPB in Indonesia. First, general information is presented on OPB in Indonesia (availability, properties, and governmental policy). Second, the torrefaction of OPB for the production of upgraded solid fuel is summarized. Third, the pyrolysis of OPB to produce biochar is reviewed for use as a soil amendment and in carbon storage. The market perspective and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the thermally treated OPB are discussed, targeting the generation of electricity (OPB torrefaction) and agricultural soil enhancement (OPB biochar). The recycling of OPB is expected to contribute to the sustainability and economic success of the oil palm industry and also the net-zero 2060 in Indonesia.

TI  - Reproductive phenology of critical native plant species for mineland restoration in the eastern Amazon
T2  - PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon ironstone outcrops vegetation, or canga, is a remarkable environment in which the plants are adapted to peculiar circumstances. Knowledge regarding different aspects of this ecosystem remains modest, including necessary insights for its conservation and recovery, such as the reproductive phenology of priority species that form the plant community. This study aimed to monitor the reproductive phenology of critical native species that are categorized as rare, endemic, and/or threatened in the canga of the Amazon Rainforest, in Para, Brazil. During February 2016 and May 2017, eleven species were evaluated regarding the presence or absence of flowering and fruiting phenophases, and these were associated with environmental variables. Phenological data were evaluated through circular statistical analysis. All studied species flowered and produced fruit during the monitoring period. The evaluated species have an annual reproductive cycle marked by seasonality and flowering peaks between March and April, during the wet season, and fruiting peaks during May, at the beginning of the dry season. The best period for collecting ripe seeds, a primary tool for the restoration of degraded areas, is June. Water availability may be essential for the establishment of annual plants and to induce flowering in both annual and perennial species. The reproductive phenophases of the studied species are concentrated within a short period and are synchronized, which may increase the possibility of cross-pollination and minimize flower and seed predation. We discuss the challenges in including annual plants and the importance of having them and perennial species in conservation and restoration of degraded areas projects.

TI  - Early Response of Tree Seed Arrival After Liana Cutting in a Disturbed Tropical Forest
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most remaining tropical forests are under some level of chronic human disturbance, which may favor the proliferation of disturbance-adapted native plants, like some species of tropical lianas. These plants may alter forest structure and composition, but little is known about their effect on ecological processes, such as seed rain. We analyzed the early effects of overabundant lianas on the seed rain of animal-dispersed tree species for 1 year. We analyzed the effect of overabundant lianas on seed rain by cutting all lianas in experimental plots of 314.1 m(2), establishing 12 paired plots with and without liana cutting in a disturbed Atlantic Forest remnant in Southeastern Brazil. Rarefied tree seed species richness was higher in plots dominated by lianas (10.9 +/- 0.2 and 8.3 +/- 1.2 for 500 seeds sampled in liana-dominated and liana-cut plots, respectively), but seed abundance was lower (209 +/- 138 and 984 +/- 421 seeds m(-2) in liana-dominated and liana-cut plots, respectively). Pioneer seed abundance (316.0 +/- 116.3 seeds m(-2)) and species density (3.2 +/- 0.3 species trap(-1)) did not differ among treatments. Lianas may eventually increase local seed rain diversity, while suppressing local tree seed rain abundance. Understanding the impact of the dominance of ruderal species in ecological processes that maintain tropical forests communities, such as seed rain, is crucial to guide the directions for conservation and management of degraded remnants.

TI  - Understanding and mitigating water resource decline in the deli watershed: a comprehensive analysis
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deli watershed, located in the North Sumatra Province, is part of the Belawan-Ular-Padang River Area, which has the potential to supply raw water to three cities/regencies: Medan City, Deli Serdang Regency, and Karo Regency. According to the Regulation of the Minister of Public Works and Public Housing Number 04/PRT/M/2015, the Deli watershed area is classified as a National Strategic River Area. Despite its potential, the rapid economic growth and population increase have led to changes in land use, which have negatively impacted the carrying capacity of water resources in the Deli watershed. In this study, we used a dynamic system approach and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to assess the condition of the Deli watershed's water resource carrying capacity. The integration of dynamic systems and AHP yielded a water resource carrying capacity index, which describes the condition of the Deli watershed's water resources. Under current conditions, the value of the water resource carrying capacity index of the Deli watershed is expected to decline annually from 2019 to 2028. To increase the carrying capacity of water resources, it is recommended to decrease birth and migration rates, reduce water use, and restore land functions.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities shaped by host-plant affect the outcome of plant-soil feedback in dryland restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can be a useful tool to overcome challenges in dry forest restoration. However, advances are still needed to guide choices regarding soil origin and inoculum production methods, since outcomes can vary due to plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). We evaluate how soil origin and host plant used for inoculum production affect AMF community and therefore the plant biomass accumulation and functional traits. In the conditioning phase, we investigated whether soils originating from a recovered area (Quarry) and a vegetation fragment (Caatinga) would have their AMF communities modified due to the growth of Sorghum bicolor (used for inoculum production) and Senna uniflora (used in Brazilian semiarid restoration). In the feedback phase, we compared the performance of four plants species growing on a degraded soil and inoculated or not by a mixture of AMF isolates in comparison to soil inoculum prepared from the conditioning phase. The inoculum from Caatinga presented seven times more AMF species compared to that from the Quarry, which presented ruderal and stress tolerant species. The soil inoculum conditioned by S. uniflora, regardless of origin, presented greater evenness compared to the soil inoculum produced with S. bicolor and promoted 33% more plant biomass compared to the control without inoculation. Root colonization by AMF increased PSF and decreased plant investment in functional traits such as specific root length (SRL) and specific leaf area (SLA). Our results demonstrate the importance of adopting strategies that preserve local adaptation of inoculants produced. The use of native plant for propagation of native AMF in the conditioning phase provided more positive responses for Mesosphaerum suaveolens and Rhaphiodon echinus than inoculated with introduced AMF isolates. This is probably due to the interaction of inoculated plants with responsive AMF present in the soil. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that conditioning field-collected soil with Senna uniflora and using it for inoculation can be a simple technique to promote biomass accumulation for other native herbaceous species. This preserves the compatibility between the soil inoculum produced with native AMF and native plants, representing an important tool for restoration programs.

TI  - Organic matter storage in a sandy clay loam Acrisol affected by tillage and cropping systems in southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT, and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M, The O+V/M+C under NT, which probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg ha(-1) more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha(-1) more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg ha(-1) per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of about 44 Mg ha(-1) from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue additions to soil surface.

TI  - Influence of intensive cropping of vegetables on physical and hydraulic properties and functions of an Oxisol in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of agricultural systems (e.g., vegetable production) to supply the food demand of the world's population has increased over the last decades. In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (p), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in p and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term.

TI  - Local Wisdom of West Timorese Farmers in Land Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper's working hypothesis is that the indigenous farming practices of Timorese farmers are those most suitable and adaptable with regard to these farmers' circumstances. Intensive farming and the acceleration of land conversion in Java lead to a reduction in favorable cropland and the degradation of soil biology. To meet the demand for food production, unfavorable areas outside Java, including marginal semi-arid areas on Timor Island, East Nusa Tenggara province, have become an important option. Unfortunately, the national crop production policy has paid less attention to the specific biophysical characteristics of the region and how local people have adapted to the diverse marginal environment. We review the literature in the areas of soil nutrition retention and soil biology, vegetation/crop diversity, and farming practices/management, including local wisdom on soil management. This paper highlights that the values of the chemical parameters of the soils in question are varied, but generally range from low to high. The existence of beneficial micro-organisms is important both for improving soil fertility and due to their association with local vegetation/crops. Traditional farming practices, such as the local agroforestry of Mamar, have effectively preserved the existence of micro-organisms that promote conservation practices, crop/vegetation diversity, and sustainable agriculture. We recommend that the expansion of croplands and crop production into marginal semi-arid areas needs to be considered and adapted while taking into consideration sustainability and environmentally sound traditional practices.

TI  - Predicting flooding tolerance of native tree species to restore flooded forests
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Flooded forests are critically important for supplying water-related ecosystem services, but their restoration has been severely limited by low seedling performance due to flooding stress. We classified the flooding tolerance of 15 native tree species in a nursery-based method to guide species selection for restoring a flooded forest.Location Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.Methods We first exposed 15 native tree species typical of flooded forests to four flooding conditions (i.e., normoxia and three increasing hypoxia levels): no flooding, up to the middle of the root system, up to the root collar, and 2 cm above the root collar. After nine months, we evaluated seedling survival, growth (height and stem diameter), and the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. Seedling survival and growth data were combined to create a flooding tolerance index. Further, we planted the same species in two degraded swampy areas under three soil preparation methods: planting seedlings in regular planting holes, on mounds, and in between furrows. We assessed seedling survival and stem diameter of these seedlings after one year.Results Flooding tolerance index was significantly correlated to the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels, but not of adventitious roots. Classifying flooding tolerance of tree species was effective in predicting species growth, but not seedling survival, in restoration plantations. Overall, seedling performance in restoration plantations was highly influenced by species identity, but not by soil preparation methods.Conclusions Species selection to improve restoration performance of flooded forests can be guided by simple and fast screenings performed in nurseries before planting. Pioneer trees may facilitate the establishment of species less tolerant to flooding by reducing water saturation of superficial soil layers and enhancing micro-relief heterogeneity by litter deposition. Only a few native species should initially be used in the restoration of flooded forests with high water tables.

TI  - Influence of soil management for soybean production under microbial diversity in amazon soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical Amazon has a unique biodiversity that has been affected by the development of pastures and economically important crops, such as soybeans. In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficient use of food resources is a precondition for wild species ' survival in urban environments. The feeding ecology of animals in tropical cities, however, remains poorly investigated. Here we study the feeding ecology of parrots in Manaus, a major Amazonian city, and compare the results with a parrot assemblage living in undisturbed habitats. We recorded 203 feeding bouts from eight parrot species, which consumed parts of 51 plant species. Parrot diets were dominated by native palm species (Arecaceae). Exotic plants, however, constituted an important portion of the diet of some parrots. Levin's indices, a measure of food niche width, varied from 0.40 to 0.83, indicating an overall tendency to generalist diets. Diet overlap between species was small, indicating broad resource partitioning between members of the assemblage. The diversity of plants consumed in the natural environment was greater than in the urban environment (71 species vs. 52). However, the diversity of plants consumed was similar for parrot species recorded both in natural and urban environments, indicating that occupation of the city does not imply an impoverishment in parrot diets. Creation of municipal protected areas and increasing the city afforestation would provide complementary strategies for Manaus parrot conservation.

TI  - An ecosystem approach to small-scale fisheries through participatory diagnosis in four tropical countries
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory diagnosis is an approach to identify, prioritize and mobilise around factors that constrain or enable effective governance and management in small-scale fisheries. Diagnostic frameworks are mostly designed and used for systematic scientific analysis or impact evaluation. Through participation they also have potential to guide contextually informed improvements to management in practice, including transitions to contemporary forms of governance like the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) the focus of our study. We document and critically reflect on participatory diagnosis processes and outcomes at sites in Indonesia, Philippines, Solomon Islands and Tanzania. These sites were part of an international project on the implementation of the EAF and differed widely in institutional and operational contexts. The Participatory Diagnosis and Adaptive Management framework and the "issue radar" diagnosis map were used to identify, evaluate and address factors associated with navigating management transitions towards the EAF. We found that many challenges and priority actions identified by participants were similar across the four study countries. Participants emphasized habitat restoration, particularly mangrove rehabilitation, and livelihood enhancement. The importance of strengthening governance entities, networks and processes (e.g., harmonization of policies, education and awareness of policies) was also a prominent outcome of the diagnosis. Site-specific factors were also explored together with the differing views among stakeholders. We conclude that diagnosis frameworks are indeed useful tools for guiding management transitions in fisheries, particularly where they enable flexibility in approaches to diagnosing problems and applying solutions to local contexts.

TI  - Prediction and mapping of erodibility factors (USLE and WEPP) by magnetic susceptibility in basalt-derived soils in northeastern SAo Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial assessment of soil erosion is essential for the adaptation of agricultural practices and monitoring of soil losses. In this sense, this study aims to assess the efficiency of magnetic susceptibility (MS) as a predictor of soil erodibility factors (K for USLE model; K-i and K-r for WEPP model) fora detailed mapping of Oxisols with different iron contents in northeastern SAo Paulo State, Brazil. This study was carried out in an area of 380 hectares under sugarcane cultivation in SAo Paulo State. Soil samples were collected in a sampling grid (150) and in a transect (86) and physical and chemical analyses and calculations of the erodibility factors/parameters K, K-i, and K-r were performed. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were calibrated using simple linear regression analysis to predict the factors/parameters K and K-i using MS as a predictor variable. The observed values of MS and the predicted values of the factors/parameters K, K-i, and K-r were submitted to geostatistical analysis for constructing maps. Magnetic susceptibility can be used as a predictor of erodibility factors (K for USLE model; K-i and K-r for WEPP model) for Oxisols with total iron content ranging from 1 to 20% Fe2O3, with a precision of up to 60% and an accuracy of up to 85%. The results can guide future studies on water erosion in a tropical environment using magnetic soil data as an environmental covariate in the modeling process for large areas.

TI  - FOREST CONVERSION AND PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of quantifying existing ecosystem services, assessing the impacts of various land use decisions and ultimately evaluating the overall costs and benefits of different land use patterns having internalized ecosystem services, is now widely recognized and such work is at the forefront of current landscape management planning. We aim to quantify ecosystem services derived from different land uses within the Atibainha Reservoir catchment in Brazil, determine the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and quantify the impacts of land use changes on the provision of ecosystem services. Four ecosystem services were considered: carbon sequestration, mitigation of sediment delivery into the reservoir, purification of water and maintenance of soil fertility. Results indicate strong increase in the provision of ecosystem services among the main land uses in the following order: urban area/bare soil; pastures; plantation of eucalyptus and native forests. The most important services provided by native forests, when compared with bare soil, were carbon sequestration and prevention of sedimentation, with an additional 864 569 tons of carbon stored in forest biomass in 30 years, and prevention of 244 5 I 1 tons of sediment delivery into the reservoir per year, respectively, from 7624 ha of lands around the reservoir. Spatial variation in the provision of ecosystem services were mapped to develop a tool to support decision making at the landscape scale. Results and maps from the decision support tool can support policies that ensure effective land-use planning and can serve as the basis for the development of payment for ecosystem service schemes in the region.

TI  - Survival and growth of planted and naturally established trees in a degraded caatinga area
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Semiarid region in the Northeast of Brazil is characterized by Caatinga tropical forests, adapted to 8 -to -9 months of annual water stress. Human activities have resulted in environmental degradation due to tree removal and soil exposure to erosion factors; however, planting native trees, such as Mimosa tenuiflora and Cnidoscolus quercifolius, may accelerate environmental recovery. Tree recovery was evaluated in a degraded areas under a 14-year period of grazing exclusion (2005 to 2019) and planting of M. tenuiflora (2005 and 2009) and C. quercifolius (2007 and 2009) and under natural regeneration. Data on survival, height, and diameter of planted seedlings, and the number, species, height, and diameter of naturally regenerating trees were collected. The absence of grazing allowed for the establishment of 50.5% and 44.6% of the 204 M. tenuiflora and 204 C. quercifolius planted seedlings, which presented mean heights of 395 and 355 cm and mean basal diameters of 92 and 76 mm. Naturally regenerated M. tenuiflora and C. quercifolius totaled 190 and 7 plants, with heights of 95 and 139 cm, and basal diameters of 10 and 26 mm. A naturally established specimen of Cenostigma pyramidale with a height of 175 cm and basal diameter of 36 mm was found. This denotes the positive effect of seedling planting on tree cove compared to a nearby continuously grazed area; however, full recovery, especially regarding diversity of the tree community, requires more than 14year grazing exclusion, tree planting, and natural regeneration.

TI  - Planning and Design of Urban Flood Control Measures: Assessing Effects Combination
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Different approaches related with urban flood problems treatment are evolving and there is a large set of possible engineering measures that can be applied. Lately, the traditional approach, focusing on improving channel conveyance, is being complemented by distributed structural measures and nonstructural measures, considering the basin under a systemic point of view and aiming to recover natural flow patterns prior to urbanization. In this context, it becomes necessary to evaluate the potential use of different combinations of the possible interventions, in such a way that the efficacy of these sets in terms of flood mitigation can be optimized. This kind of analysis is of crucial importance and involves technical and economic aspects. Combined effects of the chosen measures may produce a result that is not equivalent to what would be expected from the summation of its individual effects. The systemic behavior of an urban watershed, especially when the drainage system works jointly with flooded urban landscape elements, makes it possible that some design solutions become to act in a noneffective way. Sometimes, different interventions just superimpose concurrent results. On the other hand, it is possible to generate better results, with extra benefits, when proposing adequate combinations capable to join efforts. Mathematical models may act as valuable tools that are able to simulate floods in complex urban watersheds and provide an integrated assessment capability. In this context, mathematical models can evaluate the efficacy of flood control measures sets. In this paper, a mathematical model, based on the flow cell concept, was applied to study the use of a wide range of different flood control measures in the Joana River watershed, located at the northern region of Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. This model is composed by a hydrodynamic core that works together with a distributed hydrologic model. According to the achieved results, it is possible to notice that distributed detention reservoirs-located at upstream reaches, parks and public squares, and also at urban sites-are very important flood control alternatives. It is also noticed that reforestation of slope areas, although some of which are nowadays occupied by lower income communities, is a desirable alternative. Finally, it must be stressed that even traditional flood control measures, presently avoided in many design situations as they may transfer downstream inundation problems, can be important in an integrated flood control project, if adequately combined with other measures.

TI  - Multiple use forestry planning: Timber and Brazil nut management in the community forests of Northern Bolivia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bolivia's Northern Amazon, forests long used for the extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are now experiencing increased logging. The extraction of timber and economically important NTFPs such as Brazil nuts (from the emergent forest tree Bertholletia excelsa) is occurring in the same forests and provides a clear opportunity to integrate management decisions and planning. Bolivia's forestry legislation allows, in principle, the management of multiple forest resources. However, there is little evidence that the opportunity has led to greater integration of management decisions and practice. Actually, management of each resource is typically carried out by different stakeholders with resident families responsible for Brazil nut gathering while logging companies carry out the timber harvest. This paper analyzes community forest management plans in Northern Bolivia to examine whether community residents participated in the development and implementation of the timber management plans, and the extent to which proponents of timber management plans attempted to integrate Brazil nut management into timber harvesting. The research draws on analysis of approved timber management plans for community forests and focus group interviews with residents in selected forest communities. Based on observations, the paper concludes that multiple-use management in these forests could be improved by strengthening community level institutions by confirming their authority over timber management operations and by building capacity to oversee and monitor the extraction activities of loggers working on their land.

TI  - Effects of previous land use on genotype-by-environment interactions in two loblolly pine progeny tests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) is widely used for forestry in southern Brazil, with most seeds coming from clonal seed orchards. This study investigated the effects of previous land use on the adaptability, stability, and productivity of loblolly pine progenies in southern Brazil, aiming to produce a second-generation clonal seed orchard (CSO). Two progeny tests were installed in southern Brazil. In FARA, 52 open-pollinated loblolly pine progenies were tested, and in TUNAS, 65 open-pollinated loblolly pine progenies were tested, 35 of which were common to both tests. FARA is a rotation area previously used for annual agronomic crops (oats, corn, soy, beans), whereas, TUNAS is a recycled loblolly pine plantation forest. The diameter at breast height (dbh) and stem height were measured at six years of age, and the wood volume was calculated. Genetic parameters were estimated using REML/BLUP method in SELEGEN software. The adaptability, stability, and productivity of the progenies were estimated by the relative performance harmonic mean of the breeding values method (MHPRVG). The breeding values for volume were used to estimate genetic gains through selection. The heritability values were slightly higher in FARA compared to those in TUNAS. Most of the individual narrow-sense heritability values were between 0.10 and 0.20 for growth traits. And most of the family-mean heritability values were above 0.50. In FARA, the selection strategy resulted in up to 26.37% genetic gain, while for TUNAS, it reached about 20%. GE effects are significant for volume. Because of the significant GE effects it is necessary to consider previous land use in the selection of genotypes for the formation of loblolly pine CSOs in the tested region. Considering the MHPRVG ranking, the maximum genetic gain estimated is 13.20%. The choice of more stable genotypes can circumvent the challenges imposed by crop rotation in the tested areas.

TI  - Genetic diversity of indigenous tropical fast-growing rhizobia isolated from soybean nodules
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterized genetically 30 fast-growing rhizobial strains isolated from nodules of Asian and modern soybean genotypes that had been inoculated with soils from disparate regions of Brazil. Analyses by rep-PCR (ERIC and REP) and RAPD indicated a high level of genetic diversity among the strains. The RFLP-PCR and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that none of the strains was related to Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii, whereas most were related to Rhizobium tropici (although they were unable to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris) and to Rhizobium genomic species Q. One strain was related to Rhizobium sp. OR 191, while two others were closely related to Agrobacterium (Rhizobium) spp.; furthermore, symbiotic effectiveness with soybean was maintained in those strains. Five strains were related to Bradyrhizobium japonicum and B. elkanii, with four of them being similar to strains carried in Brazilian inoculants, therefore modifications in physiological properties, as a shorter doubling time might have resulted from adaptation to local conditions. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PFLA) was less precise in delineating taxonomic relationships. The strains fit into eight Nod-factor profiles that were related to rhizobial species, but not to N-2-fixation capacity or competitiveness. The data obtained highlight the diversity and promiscuity of rhizobia in the tropics, being capable of nodulating exotic legumes and might reflect ecological strategies to survive in N-poor soils; in addition, the diversity could also represent an important source of efficient and competitive rhizobial strains for the tropics. Putative new rhizobial species were detected only in undisturbed soils. Three species (R. tropici, B. j. apom. cum and B. elkanii) were found under the more sustainable management system known as no-till, while the only species isolated from soils under conventional till was R. tropici. Those results emphasize that from the moment that agriculture was introduced into undisturbed soils rhizobial diversity has changed, being drastically reduced when a less sustainable soil management system was adopted.

TI  - Restoration success in former Amazonian mines is driven by soil amendment and forest proximity
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining contributes importantly to tropical deforestation and land degradation. To mitigate these effects, mining companies are increasingly obliged to restore abandoned mine lands, but factors driving restoration success are hardly evaluated. Here, we investigate the influence of ecological factors (restoration age, soil properties and surrounding forest area) and management factors (diversity and density of planted species, mine zone) on the recovery rate of forest structure and tree diversity on 40 post-mining restoration areas in Southern Amazonia, Brazil, using a 9-year annual monitoring dataset consisting of over 25 000 trees. We found that recovery of forest structure was closely associated with interactions between soil quality and the planted tree communities, and that tree diversity recovery was positively associated with the amount of surrounding forests. We also observed that forest structure and diversity recover more slowly in mine tailings compared to pit surroundings. Our study confirms the complexity of mine land restoration but also reveals that planting design and soil improvement can increase restoration success. For resource-efficient mine restoration, we recommend the focusing of efforts on tailings, which are hardest to restore, and reducing efforts in pit surroundings and areas close to surrounding forest because of their potential for restoration by natural regeneration.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Silvopastoral Systems in the Cold Zone of Brazil
T2  - SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS IN SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The cold zone of Brazil occupies approximately 6 % of the national territory and is located between latitudes 24 degrees S and 33 degrees S. In this area, extensive cattle and sheep farming systems and conventional cropping and forestry are predominant. With the end of government subsidies by the decade of 1980s, an increase in farming production costs, a decrease of native forest covering, an increase of degraded areas in agriculture and livestock farming systems and a mismatch between timber national supply and demand after 1990s, an opportunity arises for integrate forestry with livestock and agriculture activities in Brazil, particularly in the southern. This chapter initially reports key events over the last three decades that have supported the increasing interest of farmers and enterprises on agroforestry activities, with focus on silvopastoral systems in the cold area of Brazil. Then, relevant advances on silvopastoral systems from research and extension services were reported, highlighting the screening of shaded adapted forage plants and management, trees species screening for silvipastoral systems and animal performance and behaviour under trees. Finally, the chapter analyses the existent opportunities to increase silvopastoral areas in southern Brazil and future challenges for research, development and technology transfer.

TI  - Surface runoff influenced by single and consortia of cover crops in southern Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops (CCs) are essential for mitigating surface runoff and water erosion. This study reports whether different single and consortia of CCs differ in the attenuation of surface runoff in no-till areas in southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted on a Psammentic Paleudult soil using 14.5 x 3 m plots, with six treatments: T1- bare soil (control) (BS); T2- permanent grasses (PG); T3- black oat and forage turnip followed by beans or cowpea (O+T-B/C); T4- ryegrass followed by beans or pigeon pea (R-B/P); T5- black oat and vetch followed by beans or cowpea (O+V-B/C); and T6- forage peanut (FP). After six years of experimentation (medium term), continuous monitoring of surface runoff in 2022 showed that CCs treatments reduce by up to 65 % the number of precipitation events in which surface runoff occurs, delay the onset of surface runoff, attenuate the rise and peak of the hydrograph, and decrease by up to 97 % the annual surface runoff depth compared to BS treatment. The treatment with FP most efficiently attenuated the surface runoff. Treatments with succession or diversification of annual CCs (O+T-B/C, R-B/P, O+V-B/C) showed similar efficiency to FP. Treatment with PG was the least effective in controlling surface runoff. In conclusion, different single and consortium of CCs vary in their ability to attenuate surface runoff in no-till areas in southern Brazil. Increasing live plant biomass input and the spatial and temporal diversification of CCs, especially legumes, are key factors in maximizing the control of surface runoff in no-till areas. Integral control of surface runoff, however, requires complementary measures.

TI  - Adaptive integumentary features of beef cattle raised on afforested or non-shaded tropical pastures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to analyze the seasonal acclimatization process of Nelore and Canchim cattle raised on two production systems (non-shaded, NS, and integrated crop-livestock-forest, ICLF), based on the dynamics of the morphological and functional attributes of the hair coat and skin during winter and summer. The study was conducted in Brazil, in a low-altitude tropical climate region. A completely randomized 2 x 2 factorial design was adopted as follows: two production systems (NS and ICLF), two breeds (Nelore and Canchim) in a longitudinal structure, with measurements repeated over time through two stations (winter and summer). The experimental animals consisted of 32 Nelore (Bos indicus) and 32 Canchim (5/8 Bos taurus x 3/8 Bos indicus) bulls. The animals were equally distributed between two intensive rotational grazing systems. In both breeds, the hair coat was significantly thicker in winter but longer in summer, which increased epidermal protection. The Nelore bulls had shorter, wider, and thicker hairs, which are attributes that promote heat loss via conduction. The Canchim bulls showed significantly lower hair density and higher epithelium distance to sweat glands, which resulted in higher core temperature and respiratory rate. In turn, Nelore bulls had higher serum concentrations of triiodothyronine and lower serum concentrations of cortisol. However, Canchim bulls more frequently and intensely activated their thermoregulatory system and markedly adjusted their hair coat and hair features to reduce heat gain, especially in summer. Therefore, the anatomical plasticity and functional integumentary characteristics of Nelore and Canchim bulls reflect their acclimatization to tropical conditions.

TI  - Classification of potential landslides using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission imagery in the Tulis Watershed, Indonesia
T2  - SAINS TANAH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tulis is one of the watersheds in the Mrica Reservoir Catchment Area in Indonesia. The Tulis Watershed has an area of 12,750 ha, which is dominated by hilly areas with areas below alluvial-colluvial. This study aimed to map the potential distribution of the landslides in the Tulis Watershed. As the Tulis Watershed has the potential for landslides, this study was conducted by using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery year 2016. This study considered five aspects that affect landslides, namely: geological type, soil regolith depth, fault, slope, and soil texture. Areas in the Tulis Watershed were classified into five levels of landslide potential The following landslide classes and the area they cover were predicted after applying the formula: very low (0%), low (48%, 6,126 ha), moderate (51%, 6,548 ha), high (0.5%, 63 ha), and very high (0.1%, 13 ha). From the results of the level of potential landslides, several prevention and mitigation measures are recommended according to the level. For shallow landslide levels, it is recommended that relocation centers should be set up. In contrast, for those areas with very high landslide potential, it is necessary to mitigate and install Early Warning System (EWS) tools and prepare the community for adaptation.

TI  - Urban forest loss using a GIS-based approach and instruments for integrated urban planning: A case study of Joao Pessoa, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests play an important role in the thermal comfort and overall life of local populations in large- and medium-sized cities. This study analyzes urban forest loss and maps land use and land cover (LULC) changes between 1991 and 2018 by evaluating the use of urban planning instruments for the mitigation of urban forest loss in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. For this purpose, satellite-derived LULC images from 1991, 2006, 2010 and 2018 and data on urban forest loss areas obtained using the Google Earth Engine were used. In addition, this paper also discusses the instruments used for integrated urban planning, which are (a) the legal sector, responsibility and nature; (b) the urban expansion process; and (c) the elements of urban infrastructure. The results show a clear shift in land use in the study area. The major changes in LULC classes occurred in urban areas and herbaceous vegetation, while the greatest loss was in arboreal/shrub vegetation. Thus, an increase in the pressure to occupy zones intended for environmental preservation could be estimated. Our results showed similar accuracies with other studies and more spatial details. The characteristics of the patterns, traces, and hotspots of urban expansion and forest cover loss were explored. We highlighted the potential use of this proposed framework to be applied and validated in other parts of the world to help better understand and quantify various aspects of urban-related problems such as urban forest loss mapping using instruments for integrated urban planning and low-cost approaches.

TI  - Strategies for overcoming farmers' lives in volcano-prone areas: A case study in Mount Semeru, Indonesia
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Semeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia and the highest mountain in Java Island. Although the island is prone to volcanic eruptions, it is densely populated and also home to several farmers. The aim of this study is to analyze the strategies for overcoming farmers' lives in Mount Semeru. This study involves 150 farmers who were randomly selected from terrains located at altitudes between 6 and 10 km in Mount Semeru. This study shows that farmers benefit significantly from the fertile lands resulting from volcanic eruptions. And they are highly motivated to engage in mitigation activities to reduce the impacts of eruption; therefore, they tend to participate in mitigation education or programs organized by government or private institutions. Support with the information and financial access regarding any mitigation strategies can help farmers a lot. Coordination among stakeholders to support mitigation strategies is necessary because all the parties are equally responsible for alleviating the impacts of volcanic eruptions. Any strategies for overcoming farmers' lives in volcano areas also can be supported by community resilience.

TI  - Straw Removal Effects on Soil Water Dynamics, Soil Temperature, and Sugarcane Yield in South-Central Brazil
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sugarcane straw as bioenergy feedstock has been encouraged in recent years due to its potential to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate straw removal causes soil damages, impairing crop development and productivity. Experiments in three sugarcane growing locations (Quata-SP, Chapadao do Ceu-GO, and Quirinopolis-GO) were conducted over 2 years to evaluate soil water dynamics, soil temperature, and sugarcane yield under diverse edaphoclimatic conditions. Straw removal of 0%, 50%, and 100% was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Dielectric water potential sensors were used to record soil water potential (psi, kPa) and soil temperature (degrees C) every 6 h at a 0.15-m depth. Sugarcane yields were measured annually using an instrumented truck equipped with load cells. In general, the complete and partial straw removals were detrimental to water storage and therefore to plant available water causing an increase in soil temperature during sprouting and tillering phases, which are extremely important periods for a good crop establishment and, consequently, for yield increase. For the experimental sites presenting high fertility, greater water holding capacity, high sugarcane yield potential, and considering an extended water deficit in early stages of crop development, the complete straw removal resulted in yield losses of up to 16 and 40 Mg ha(-1), respectively. For the experimental site presenting low sugarcane yield potential, even with low water deficit at the beginning of crop seasons, straw removal had no significant influence on sugarcane yield in the short term, since straw did not produce enough improvements to soil in order to enable benefits for water retention.

TI  - Delineation of Cocoa Agroforests Using Multiseason Sentinel-1 SAR Images: A Low Grey Level Range Reduces Uncertainties in GLCM Texture-Based Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating the cropping area of cocoa agroforests is a major challenge in quantifying the contribution of land use expansion to tropical deforestation. Discriminating cocoa agroforests from tropical transition forests using multispectral optical images is difficult due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of their canopies. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover in the tropics greatly impedes optical sensors. This study evaluated the potential of multiseason Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to discriminate cocoa agroforests from transition forests in a heterogeneous landscape in central Cameroon. We used an ensemble classifier, Random Forest (RF), to average the SAR image texture features of a grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) across seasons. We then compared the classification performance with results from RapidEye optical data. Moreover, we assessed the performance of GLCM texture feature extraction at four different grey levels of quantization: 32 bits, 8 bits, 6 bits, and 4 bits. The classification's overall accuracy (OA) from texture-based maps outperformed that from an optical image. The highest OA (88.8%) was recorded at the 6 bits grey level. This quantization level, in comparison to the initial 32 bits in the SAR images, reduced the class prediction error by 2.9%. The texture-based classification achieved an acceptable accuracy and revealed that cocoa agroforests have considerably fragmented the remnant transition forest patches. The Shannon entropy (H) or uncertainty provided a reliable validation of the class predictions and enabled inferences about discriminating inherently heterogeneous vegetation categories.

TI  - Fabrication of biochar-based hybrid Ag nanocomposite from algal biomass waste for toxic dye-laden wastewater treatment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual functional innovative approaches were developed to tackle the algal scum problem in water by utilizing the algal (Spirogyra sp.) biomass waste for organic dye-laden industrial wastewater treatment, a global problem, and challenge. Therefore, an algal biochar-based nanocomposite (nAgBC) was synthesized and employed as a lowcost adsorbent for Congo red (CR) removal. Surface morphology, physicochemical characteristics, elemental composition, phase, and stability of the nanocomposite was analyzed using BET, FESEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, XPS, and TGA. The nanocomposite was found to be thermostable, mesoporous with large and heterogeneous surface area, containing nAg as doped material, where -OH, NH, C--O, C--C, SO, and CH are the surface binding active functional groups. Maximum adsorption efficiency of 95.92% (18 mg L-1 CR) was achieved (qe = 34.53 mg g-1) with 0.5 g L-1 of nanocomposite after 60 min, at room temperature (300 K) at pH 6. Isotherm and kinetic model suggested multilayer chemisorption, where adsorption thermodynamics indicated spontaneous reaction. Fluorescens spectral analysis of CR confirmed the formation of CR supramolecule, supporting enhanced adsorption. Furthermore, the result suggested a 5th cycle reusability and considerable efficacy towards real textile industrial effluents. Synergistic effects of the active surface functional groups of the biochar and nAg, along with the overall surface charge of the composite lead to chemisorption, electrostatic attraction, H-bonding, and surface complexation with CR molecules. Thus, synthesized nAgBC can be applicable to mitigate the wastewater for cleaner production and environment.

TI  - Effectiveness of inoculation with rumen fluid containing Synergistes jonesii to control DHP toxicity in ruminants in eastern Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility and efficacy of inoculating with rumen fluid as a method to control hydroxypyridone (DHP) toxicity in ruminants on high leucaena diets in eastern Indonesia were investigated. Rumen fluid collected from 2 buffalo identified as 'protected', due to low levels of DHP excretion in urine, was orally administered to animals identified as 'unprotected' and concentrations of urinary DHP monitored. Control animals were dosed with water only. Treatments were randomly allocated to 10 recipient animals: 3 goats and 7 cattle. All animals were fed a diet containing freshly cut 100% leucaena during the 18 day study period. Measurement of urinary DHP via colorimetric analysis commenced 8 days prior to animals being drenched with rumen fluid or water and continued for 10 days afterwards. Urinary DHP levels in animals that received the inoculum did not differ from those in the control group 10 days post-inoculation (mean 425 mg DHP/L; P = 0.50). Unexpectedly, DHP levels in all animals (rumen fluid and water) declined with time, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.12), and remained above considered safe threshold levels. These results suggest that transfer of rumen fluid to overcome leucaena toxicity in animals in eastern Indonesia may not be effective despite great care having been taken to ensure the viability of the anaerobic organisms during the inoculation process; this methodology is also not a practical solution to replicate on a commercial scale. The findings suggest that inoculation may not be necessary if animals previously naive to leucaena are able to adapt to DHP toxicity by other means.

TI  - Dynamic environmental zoning using the CA-Markov - Markov model and multicriteria analysis in a Brazilian Cerrado Watershed
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered a hotspot for biodiversity conservation. However, in recent decades, the intensification of human activities, directly influencing changes in use and coverage, has caused severe environmental problems. Thus, this study proposed a dynamic environmental zoning model for the P & acirc;ntano River watershed (PRW) based on the CA-Markov model and Multicriteria Analysis. The methodological procedures were based on predictive modeling of land use and land cover, analysis of environmental fragility, and estimation of soil losses and sediment delivery rate from the InVEST model for the years 1984, 2007, 2013, 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results showed that over the time analyzed and projected, in the category of Legal Restrictions Zone, there was a slight decrease in the extension of Permanent Preservation Areas, while the Natural Vegetation cover increased considerably, indicating possible changes in the environmental patterns of the region. The areas classified as Plains maintained minimal variations throughout the period studied. With regard to the Rural Productive Zone, there was a notable increase in areas with Low Restriction, suggesting an expansion of less restrictive agricultural and land use activities. On the other hand, the areas with Medium and High Restrictions showed decreasing trends, signaling possible improvements in environmental management and conservation of natural resources. Also noteworthy is the significant reduction in areas classified as High Restriction, associated with the high rate of soil loss. This trend is particularly relevant as it indicates practical efforts to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and promote sustainable soil management practices. Finally, the areas designated as Special Protection Zones, including Incongruities and Reservoirs, remained stable throughout the period analyzed, demonstrating the importance of preserving these areas to conservation of biodiversity and water resources. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study contribute to guiding public policies and environmental management practices in the PRW region. The observed trends indicate a positive evolution towards the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, underscoring the importance of continuous measures to ensure the health and resilience of local ecosystems.

TI  - Urban growth and loss of green spaces in the metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Mexico City: effects of land-cover changes on climate and water flow regulation
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services that directly or indirectly benefit people, however, urban growth (especially in developing countries) generates the loss of these green areas and consequently of their ecosystem services. This paper aims to present the effects of land use and land cover changes in the last 30 years on two basic urban ecosystem services, water flow regulation and local and regional climate in two of main Latin American megacities (Sao Paulo and Mexico City). The study focuses on urban green spaces because they reduce the urban heat island effects, improve air quality, create habitats for biodiversity conservation, provide cultural services, and contribute to flooding prevention and groundwater conservation. A spatial analysis with the aid of geographic information systems was performed to assess (i) the urbanization process of the Metropolitan Areas of both cities over time; (ii) how this process generated changes in the land cover in both metropolises, and (iii) how these changes caused environmental negative impacts on ecosystem services. The loss of green areas as a consequence of urban expansion in the Metropolitan Areas of Sao Paulo and Mexico City changed the spatial distribution of urban heat island and increased the surface runoff, generating floods during the rainy periods. Our results suggest the urgent need for implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning and ecological restoration of urban green areas in both studied cities to prevent further losses in ecosystem services and to improve the quality of life of urban inhabitants.

TI  - Soybean Yield and Soil Physical Properties as Affected by Long-Term Tillage Systems and Liming in Southern Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is an important aspect of the sustainable management of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] in production systems. This work evaluated the effects of soil management systems (SMS) combined with liming performed in 1986 and in 2008 on soil physical properties and soybean yield. The study used data from the 2008/09 until the 2015/16 soybean crop seasons from a long-term experiment settled in 1986 in Passo Fundo, southern Brazil. A split-plot design was used with the SMS as the main plots arranged in randomized blocks, and the cropping systems as the sub-plots randomized within SMS. The experiment evaluated the effects of four annually performed SMS: no-tillage (NT) and reduced-tillage (RT) (i.e. two CA systems), disk ploughing + disk harrowing (DPD) and moldboard ploughing + disk harrowing (MPD) [i.e. two conventional tillage (CT) systems]. Soil bulk density (rho(s)) and total, micro and macro porosities (phi(total), phi(micro) and phi(macro)) were evaluated in 2008 and in 2016 in the 0-2.5 cm (L0 - 2.5) and 10-12.5 cm (L10 - 12.5) soil layers. After 22 years of the beginning of the experiment and compared with the undisturbed soil (from a native forest area near to the experiment), all SMS increased rho(s) by an average of 28% in the L0 - 2.5 and 25% in the L10 - 12.5, decreased phi(total) by 13% (except for NT) in the L0 - 2.5 and 17% in the L10 - 12.5, and decreased phi(macro) by 36% in the L10 - 12.5; moreover the CT systems decreased phi(micro) by 8.7% and 8.1% in the L0 - 2.5 and L10 - 12.5, respectively. At the end of this 22-year period, in the L0 - 2.5, rho(s) increased by 6% from NT to RT, and by 11% from NT to CT systems; phi(total) decreased by 4%, and phi(micro) increased by 9% from NT to the other SMS. From 2008 to 2016, liming combined with each SMS modified soil properties in distinct manners: the combination increased rho(s) by 6% in NT (L0 - 2.5) and 5% in MPD (L10 - 12.5), decreased phi(total) by 4% in MPD (L10 - 12.5), increased phi(micro) in all SMS by an average of 6% (L10 - 12.5), and reduced phi(macro) by an average of 24% in CT systems (L10 - 12.5). Soybean yield was more variable as function of growing season (average from 1866 to 4449 kg ha(- 1)) as compared to SMS treatment [average from 3088 kg ha(- 1) (DPD) to 3276 kg ha(- 1) (NT)]. Considering a global analysis of the eight crop seasons, soybean yield in NT was on average 6% greater than that of DPD, but NT grain yield was similar to RT and MPD systems. No-tillage favored soybean yield in higher yielding environments, while DPD had the greatest soybean yield and adaptability in lower yielding environments. These findings suggest that the NT system outperformed the other SMS by providing greater or similar soybean yields and being the least harmful to soil physical quality as compared to the undisturbed soil.

TI  - Population structure of elephant foot yams (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson) in Asia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The corms and leaves of elephant foot yams (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson) are important foods in the local diet in many Asian regions. The crop has high productivity and wide agroecological adaptation and exhibits suitability for the agroforestry system. Although the plant is assumed to reproduce via panmixia, a comprehensive study on the genetic background across regions to enhance wider consumer palatability is still lacking. Here, ten informative microsatellites were analyzed in 29 populations across regions in India, Indonesia and Thailand to understand the genetic diversity, population structure and distribution to improve breeding and conservation programs. The genetic diversity was high among and within regions. Some populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and bottlenecking. Pairwise FST indicated very high genetic differentiation across regions (F-ST = 0.274), and the Asian population was unlikely to be panmictic. Phylogenetic tree construction grouped the populations according to country of origin with the exception of the Medan population from Indonesia. The current gene flow was apparent within the regions but was restricted among the regions. The present study revealed that Indonesia and Thailand populations could be alternative centers of the gene pool, together with India. Consequently, regional action should be incorporated in genetic conservation and breeding efforts to develop new varieties with global acceptance.

TI  - Smart Ontology-Based System for Recommending Practices in Melon Cultivation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart agriculture systems are models that offer significant potential to improve farming practices by providing advanced tools for land analysis, plant monitoring, weed management, and produce estimation. Many small-scale farmers, particularly in major agricultural regions such as East Java, Indonesia, continue to rely on inefficient traditional methods. Therefore, this research aimed to introduce the Smart Agriculture Ontology System, an innovative framework that incorporates computer vision, deep learning, and semantic web technologies to manage agricultural knowledge effectively. The system integrated traditional observational data with sensor data into a unified knowledge graph, accessible via a query language designed for retrieving and manipulating data stored in the graph. In a case analysis at Puspalebo Orchard, Sidoarjo, East Java, this system provided real-time recommendations for seed selection, soil management, irrigation, pest control, and post-harvest handling. The results from this research showed that the system improved productivity and efficiency by delivering accurate, data-driven recommendations, making it a valuable tool for modern farming. Moreover, the methodology was designed to be generalizable and applicable to various agricultural contexts, allowing it to be a versatile method for different crops and farming conditions. The potential incorporation of external data sources, such as weather information, demonstrated the adaptability of the system for future agricultural management.

TI  - Assisted Natural Regeneration in slash-and-burn agriculture: Results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human impacts on natural tropical forests in Central Africa are to a large extent linked to shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction in pen-urban areas. This is especially true around the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is why research was conducted in 2010 by the Makala Project in the city's fuelwood supply basin. The aims were to adapt and test Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), improve slash-andburn crop systems and contribute to the enrichment of forest fallows. Prior to slashing and burning, useful trees were selected for protection. Then, during cropping, the germination and multiplication of stump shoots and root suckers from existing local forest species were promoted by selective weeding, thinning, and pruning. Monitoring of the test areas found low survival rates for old trees conserved before the land was slashed and burned, due to the difficulty of controlling the fires. This means that the technique can only be used for the edges of plots, by gradually enriching hedgerows. In contrast, stumps shoots and root suckers from natural forest species protected by AN R during agricultural weeding grew rapidly inside the plots, thus rapidly establishing woody fallows without the need for costly inputs or heavy labour. In 2014, three and a half years after slashing and burning, biodiversity and biomass in these fallows is greater than in non-ANR fallows. Better charcoal and crop productivity and a slower rate of forest transition into savannah are expected. However, social acceptance, a critical factor in the large-scale dissemination of this innovation, must be investigated in the light of potential developments in traditional and modern land tenure rights.

TI  - Fertilizer effects on the sustainability and profitability of agroforestry in the presence of carbon payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforests, where trees are planted with crops, are promoted as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture as they meet landholder demands for food, income and wood products. This is essential in countries such as Indonesia where much of the landmass is not suitable for intensive cropping (either too steep or the soils are acidic and nutrient poor), yet population pressure and increasing food demand force many farmers to implement such practices on marginal land. These practices, combined with the lack of credit, quality seed and fertilizer have contributed to decreased soil fertility and increased deforestation and soil erosion. Previous research on agroforests suggests, however, that sustainability and profitability are not guaranteed and that the addition of fertilizer to the production system may be required. This is investigated for a hedgerow-intercropping system in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments using a bioeconomic modelling framework that incorporates the SCUAF simulation model. For the assumptions used in this study it was found that fertilizer improves the productivity and sustainability of the system; it is either optimal to grow crops (Zea mays) alone provided 225 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of fertilizer is applied, or to completely convert to growing trees (Gliricidia sepium) if fertilizer is not used. This decision depends on the relative prices for crops and carbon. It was also found that there is an incentive for landholders to participate in a carbon-sink project when the previous land use has a continuously decreasing carbon stock, which is the baseline used to determine eligible carbon. Finally, compared with a more complex process model such as WaNuLCAS and data reported in the literature, the process model SCUAF consistently and reliably predicted biophysical interactions for various management regimes of tree/crop systems for use in complex economic analyses.

AB  - Agricultural activities such as an inorganic nitrogen fertilization and biomass burning contribute to increase the N2O emissions from the agricultural sector. Integrated Pest Management Field School (IPM) in chili plantations using organic based fertiliser and the application of silver-black plastic mulch promote to reduce the N2O emissions from agricultural sector. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reduction of N2O emissions using organic based fertilizer and silver-black plastic mulch treatment on IPM school plots in Rembang and Sukabumi Regencies. The results showed that there was no significant different on N2O emission from the organic based fertilizer and plastic mulch application to the control. However, treatment of organic based fertiliser and silver-black plastic mulch in IPM plots contribute to reduce the N2O emissions of 14% in Sukabumi and 27% in Rembang compared to conventional farmers' technology without organic based fertiliser and plastic mulch treatments. Thus, the IPM on the chilli plantation contribute to N2O mitigation.

CL  - Salatiga, INDONESIA
AB  - Vegetables are mostly grown in mountainous areas with an altitude >400 m a.s.l., such as Temanggung, Central Java. The steep slope farming considers very little environmental suitability and sustainability. This study was conducted in 2004, covering a total area of 87,223 ha. Soil samples were analyzed for soil texture, pH, C, N, P, K, CEC, exchangeable cations, and base saturation. Soil characteristics data were used for land suitability evaluation for vegetables crops using the Automated Land Evaluation System (ALES) program. The results showed that 36,992 ha (42.4%) of the area is located in the elevation of 400-700 m a.s.l. and about 46,786 ha (53.6%) with elevation >700 m a.s.l. The district is dominated by volcanic parent materials (83.31%), deriving Andisols with shallow (<50 cm) to medium (50-100 cm) soil depth, high phosphate retention and little to many rock fragments. Landform is mainly hilly to mountainous with slopes >15% covering 40,600 ha (46.55%) area. The district's annual rainfall ranges from 2,375-3,054 mm with 7-9 wet months (rainfall >200 mm) and <3 dry months (rainfall <100 mm). Land suitability analysis indicated that <15% of the total area is very suitable (S1) for vegetables. The majority of the land is moderately suitable (S2) and marginally suitable (S3) for asparagus, garlic, green beans, chili, long beans, potatoes, cabbage and tomatoes, with limiting factors of steep slope, coarse to stony texture, high nutrient retention and low water availability. Other limiting factors include high rainfall, weak aggregates of the Andisols, and steep slopes, causing a high erosion hazard, unless proper soil conservation measures are implemented. Selection and implementation of locally adaptable conservation techniques and P nutrient management are important for sustainable vegetable farming in this area.

TI  - The biodiversity cost of carbon sequestration in tropical savanna
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas have been increasingly viewed as an opportunity for carbon sequestration through fire suppression and afforestation, but insufficient attention has been given to the consequences for biodiversity. To evaluate the biodiversity costs of increasing carbon sequestration, we quantified changes in ecosystemcarbon stocks and the associated changes in communities of plants and ants resulting from fire suppression in savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot. Fire suppression resulted in increased carbon stocks of 1.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) since 1986 but was associated with acute species loss. In sites fully encroached by forest, plant species richness declined by 27%, and ant richness declined by 35%. Richness of savanna specialists, the species most at risk of local extinction due to forest encroachment, declined by 67% for plants and 86% for ants. This loss highlights the important role of fire in maintaining biodiversity in tropical savannas, a role that is not reflected in current policies of fire suppression throughout the Brazilian Cerrado. In tropical grasslands and savannas throughout the tropics, carbon mitigation programs that promote forest cover cannot be assumed to provide net benefits for conservation.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter aims to survey the conditions, use, management and occupancy of the Rio Verde APA. Our focus is on understanding agricultural issues, assessing areas of production, preparing maps of land suitability, and observing techniques of soil management and farming systems, such as pesticide use, fertilization, and soil conservation, among others. With these data, we aimed to identify areas of conflict of use in order to propose strategies that better suit agricultural activities in the APA with the goal of soil management, such as more suitable land-use based on identified potential use of the land, recovery of the Legal Reserve area, and strategic development. This subproject had three phases of study. The first was a preliminary survey of the local conditions through the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA). With a basis in the preliminary survey, the second phase included a pedological survey, assessment of land-use suitability and identification of areas of conflict due to overuse or underuse. In this phase, critical points, such as sources of pollution, were also identified. The third phase, in consideration of the consistent data on the area of study, refers to the development of proposed adjustments to both conservation practices and land conversion systems using Pilot Plots within the area of study and a Reference Network as the monitoring methodology. As main outcomes we highlight greater diversification shown by the producers of Colonia Cristina (Araucaria) in relation to Colonia Figueiredo (Campo Largo), although annual crops, especially corn, soybeans and beans still predominate. We also noted that areas with native forest cover are less than that required by current environmental legislation (Areas of Permanent Preservation and Legal Reserves). Livestock activities are not significant in the Basin considering the small amount of land used for pasture and tall grasslands. The prevailing system of cultivation is tillage with significant use of pesticides (all those interviewed mentioned that they use pesticides regularly). The soils of the region are predominantly: Nitosols, Oxisols and Inceptisols, which, due to mismanagement, show significant erosion and are today without topsoil (or have lost a significant proportion of topsoil). Although efforts have been made to control the erosion of agricultural soils, the problem has reached alarming levels. Survey data has shown that 15 to 20 tons of soil per hectare are lost yearly in areas of intense mechanized farming, as is the case in this Basin. When we cross-checked the land-use suitability data with the current usage, we developed a map of overused or conflict areas. From this, we observed that approximately 19% of the Basin area is overused and should be adapted or converted.

TI  - Impacts of selective logging on avian phylogenetic and functional diversity in the Amazon
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is the most extensive land use threatening tropical forests worldwide, making our understanding of its impacts on biodiversity vital for the conservation of these hyperdiverse ecosystems. We investigated the effects of selective logging on the phylogenetic and functional diversity (FD) of Amazonian forest avifauna. We sampled the overall and the understorey bird community using point counts and mist-netting, respectively, in logged and unlogged forests. The overall bird community showed significantly lower phylogenetic diversity (PD) and FD in logged than unlogged forests, but significantly higher standard effect size (ses) of PD, ses mean pairwise distance (MPD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), ses functional MPD (sesfMPD) and functional MNTD (fMNTD) in logged sites. Evolutionary distinctiveness, sesMPD, sesFD, fMNTD and sesfMNTD of understorey birds were significantly higher in logged forests. Higher logging intensity affected some metrics negatively and others positively, although the relatively small changes in phylogenetic and FD suggest limited overall effects from logging at lower intensity. In combination, selective logging brings deleterious effects for some components of phylogenetic and FD of the overall Amazonian bird community. Nonetheless, selectively logged forests retain important avian diversity, underscoring their high conservation value. Relatively, low impacts of selective logging may be due to the reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques used, high connectivity with well-preserved unlogged forests or focus on short-term logging impacts. Because even low-intensity RIL causes some losses in evolutionary history and functional traits, an optimal approach for conserving phylogenetic and FD requires incorporating some land-sparing logging to protect more old-growth patches within the logged matrix.

TI  - Climate-related land use policies in Brazil: How much has been achieved with economic incentives in agriculture?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Until 2019, the Brazilian federal government employed a number of policy measures to fulfill the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change and agriculture. While its forest law enforcement strategy was partially successful in combating illegal deforestation, the effectiveness of positive incentive measures in agriculture has been less clear. The reason is that emissions reduction from market-based incentives such as the Brazilian Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan cannot be easily verified with current remote sensing monitoring approaches. Farmers have adopted a large variety of integrated land-use systems of crop, livestock and forestry with highly diverse per-hectare carbon balances. Their responses to policy incentives were largely driven by cost and benefit considerations at the farm level and not necessarily aligned with federal environmental objectives. This article analyzes climate-related land-use policies in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean-cotton and soybean-maize cropping systems prevail. We employ agent-based bioeconomic simulation together with life-cycle assessment to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs, benefits of adoption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis confirms previous assessments but suggests a smaller farmer policy response when measured as increase in area of integrated systems. In terms of net carbon balances, our simulation results indicate that mitigation effects at the farm level depended heavily on the exact type of livestock and grazing system. The available data were insufficient to rule out even adverse effects. The Brazilian experience thus offers lessons for other land-rich countries that build their climate mitigation policies on economic incentives in agriculture.

TI  - Calibration of the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) index range for outside spaces in a tropical climate city
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to calibrate the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index range for Cuiab ' a-MT, a city with a tropical climate, for which PET calibration was not previously conducted. The air temperature, relative humidity, globe temperature, wind speed, and direction were measured in three scenarios: arboreal shading (S1), artificial shading with parasol (S2), and sun exposure (S3). Questionnaires were administered to a group of 30 people to verify the preferences, perceptions, and levels of thermal comfort of respondents with data processing, using RayMan software. The values with the greatest differences were between S1 (wooded) and S3 (sun exposure). Five categories of the PET index were adapted: slightly cold, comfortable, slightly hot, hot, and very hot. The comfortable range was found to be between 23.01 and 34.64 degrees C. When performing the correlation of the users' responses regarding their thermal perceptions and preferences in the different scenarios, it was found that in S1, the percentage of thermal comfort was the highest and in S3, the percentage of thermal discomfort was the highest, reinforcing the significance of afforestation in thermal comfort. The findings of this study contribute to the clarification of issues related to thermal perception and comfort in open spaces in tropical climate.

TI  - SELECTIVITY OF HERBICIDES IN NATIVE FOREST SPECIES OF CERRADO
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A aggravating problems in forest management is weed interference, which is a factor that modifies adaptation and reduces plant growth. The use of herbicides is an indispensable practice to mitigate these effects in reforestation areas. This study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of glyphosate and imazapyr in native plants of the Brazilian Cerrado, such as: Schinus terebinthifolia (Anacardiaceae), Peltophorum dubium (Fabaceae) and Handroanthus albus (Bignoniaceae). The trial was carried out in a greenhouse at Unit of Aquidauana/UEMS. Experimental design was completely randomized, with seven treatments and five replications. Selectivity of the herbicides in the seedlings of these species was evaluated at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 days after application (DAA) of the herbicides, by means of a percentage scale of notes, where 0% corresponds to no injury and 100% corresponds to plant death. At the same time, for the weed control evaluation, visual analysis was also performed at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 DAA of the herbicides, where 100% was considered plant death and 0% no injury to weed. Imazapyr herbicide, when applied in the initial post-emergence in its lower level, it is selective to the tree species, but in the other concentrations it can affect differently the survival of them. Glyphosate herbicide was the least selective to the tree species in its different concentrations, causing phytotoxic effects with changes in the seedlings morphology. The results of this study could help in the integrated management of weeds and contribute to the efficient herbicide use in planting forest species in the Cerrado.

AB  - The main objective of watershed management is to ensure the optimal hydrological and natural resource use for ecological, social and economic importance. One important adaptive management step in dealing with the risk of damage to forest ecosystems is the practice of agroforestry coffee. This study aimed to (1) assess the farmer's response to ecological service responsibility and (2) analyze the Sekampung watersheds management by providing environmental services. The research location was Air Naningan sub-district, Tanggamus, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The research was conducted from July until November 2016. Stratification random sampling based on the pattern of ownership of land rights is used to determine the respondents. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that coffee farmers' participation in the practice of coffee agroforestry in the form of 38% shade plants and multiple cropping (62%). The logistic regression analysis indicated that the variables of experience and status of land ownership, and incentive-size plans were able to explain variations in the willingness of coffee growers to follow the scheme of providing environmental services. The existence of farmer with partnership and CBFM scheme on different land tenure on upper Sekampung has a strategic position to minimize the deforestation and recovery watersheds destruction.

AB  - As a mitigation target for Indonesia's Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink 2030, Gunung Halimun Salak National Park (GHSNP) has a high potential. However, there is a lack of data on tree species composition and vegetation cover, particularly in the traditional zone (TZ). This study aims to estimate the vegetation cover of GHSNP in 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as tree species composition in the TZ compared to the wilderness zone ( WZ). This study used Sentinel-2 imagery and plot establishment for vegetation analysis in both zones. The most dominant class of vegetation cover in GHSNP from 2016 to 2022 is in class 5 which has highly dense vegetation. The large area class 5 increased by around 2.17% from 2016 to 2022. There were 17 species found in TZ and 24 species in WZ. Local communities are applying the traditional agroforestry of Poh-pohan (Pilea trinervia) as the main commodity and Pinus merkusii for the shade trees. P. merkusii and Maesopsis eminii are the most frequently found in TZ and WZ due to the former status of GHSNP as a production forest. Agroforestry systems can enhance biodiversity as a conservation effort and Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 actions.

TI  - Investigating of Spatial Urban Growth Pattern and Associated Landscape Dynamics in Congolese Mining Cities Bordering Zambia from 1990 to 2023
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial urban growth patterns of cities along the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia border, a region of significant economic importance characterized by cross-border trade. This activity has led to rapid but unplanned urban growth. The objective is to quantify the spatial expansion of Congolese cities (Kipushi, Kasumbalesa, Mokambo, and Sakania) bordering Zambia and to evaluate associated landscape changes. The methodology of this study includes the supervised classification of Landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2023. This classification was validated using field data. Subsequently, landscape metrics such as class area, patch number, Shannon diversity index, disturbance index, urban expansion intensity index, largest patch index, and mean Euclidean distance were calculated for each city and each date. The results reveal substantial landscape transformations in the border cities between 1990 and 2023. These changes are primarily driven by rapid urban expansion, particularly pronounced in Kasumbalesa. Between 1990 and 2023, forest cover declined from 70% to less than 15% in Kipushi, from 80% to 10% in Kasumbalesa, from 90% to 30% in Mokambo, and from 80% to 15% in Sakania. This forest cover loss is accompanied by an increase in landscape element diversity, as indicated by the Shannon diversity index, except in Kipushi, suggesting a transition towards more heterogeneous landscapes. In these border cities, landscape dynamics are also characterized by the expansion of agriculture and savannas, highlighted by an increase in the disturbance index. Analysis of spatial pattern changes shows that built-up areas, agriculture, and savannas exhibit trends of patch creation or aggregation, whereas forests are undergoing processes of dissection and patch attrition. Congolese cities bordering Zambia are undergoing substantial spatial changes propelled by intricate interactions between economic, demographic, and infrastructural factors. Our results underscore the need for sustainable development strategies to address urban sprawl through smart growth policies and mixed-use developments, mitigate deforestation via stricter land use regulations and reforestation projects, and enhance cross-border cooperation through joint environmental management and collaborative research initiatives.

TI  - Artificial neural network modeling for Congo red adsorption on microwave-synthesized akaganeite nanoparticles: optimization, kinetics, mechanism, and thermodynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to synthesize akaganeite nanoparticles (AKNPs) by using microwave and use them to adsorb Congo red dye (CR) from the aqueous solution. The AKNPs with an average particle size of about 50 nm in width and 100 nm in length could be fabricated in 20 min. The effects of pH, CR initial concentration, adsorption time, and adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process were investigated and the artificial neural network (ANN) was used to analyze the adsorption data. The various ANN structures were examined in training the data to find the optimal model. The structure with training function, TRAINLM; adaptation learning function, LARNGDM; transfer function, LOGSIG (in hidden layer) and PURELIN (in output layer); and 10 neutrons in hidden layer having the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.996) and the lowest MSE (4.405) is the optimal ANN structure. The consistency between the experimental data and the data predicted by the ANN model showed that the behavior of the adsorption process of CR onto AKNPs under different conditions can be estimated by the ANN model. The adsorption kinetics was studied by fitting the data into pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second-order model and governed by several steps. The adsorption isotherms at the different temperatures were studied by fitting the data to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models. The R-2 obtained from the Langmuir model was above 0.9 and the highest value in three of four temperatures, suggesting that the adsorption isotherms were the best fit to the Langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity was estimated to be more than 150 mg/g. Thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of CR onto AKNPs was a spontaneous and endothermic process and physicochemical adsorption. The obtained results indicated the potential application of microwave-synthesize AKNPs for removing organic dyes from aqueous solutions.

TI  - Biochar mitigates bioavailability and environmental risks of arsenic in gold mining tailings from the eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal gold mining has generated tailings highly contaminated by arsenic (As) in Cachoeira do Piri ' a, eastern Amazon, leading to severe risks to the environment. Such risks should be mitigated considering the bioavailable concentration of the element, since it implies immediate damage to the ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of biochars in mitigating the environmental risks of bioavailable As concentrations in gold mining tailings from underground and cyanidation exploration. The biochar addition increased mineral components, cation retention, phosphorus in all fractions, and organic and inorganic carbon. The bioavailability of As was reduced after adding the biochars, following the order palm kernel cake biochar > Brazil nut shell biochar > acai seed biochar, with reductions of up to 13 mg kg(-1) in the underground mining tailings and 17 mg kg(-1) in the cyanidation mining tailings. These results contributed to the statistically significant reduction of the environmental risks in both mining tailings (6-17% in the underground mining tailings and 9-20% in the cyanidation mining tailings), which was emphasized by Pearson's correlation and multivariate analyzes. The incorporation of the bioavailable fractions of As (from sequential extraction) in the environmental risk assessment was a promising method for evaluating the efficiency of biochars in mitigating the damage caused by this metalloid in gold mining tailings.

TI  - The Efficiency of Stabilized Fertilizers in Reducing Ammonia Loss Is Influenced by Liming Method
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urea is the most used nitrogen (N) fertilizer worldwide, but its rapid hydrolysis on the soil surface results in N loss in the form of ammonia (NH3-N). Enzyme inhibitors have been investigated for their ability to reduce NH3-N volatilization, particularly from no-till and surface-limed soils. This study assessed the efficiency of stabilized fertilizers in reducing NH3-N volatilization under different lime rates and application methods. The experiment followed a 2 x 4 x 3 factorial design, with two liming methods (surface application and incorporation), four base saturation levels (50, 60, 70, and 90%), and three urea (45% N) sources: conventional urea, urea + N-(n-butyl)-Thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), and urea + Boron (B) + Copper (Cu). NH3-N volatilization losses varied from 9.15 to 20.43 kg ha(-1), accounting for 11.4 to 25.5% of the applied N rate. Base saturation did not influence NH3-N volatilization. Liming method, however, had a significant effect. Urea + B + Cu was effective in reducing volatilization loss only in soils ameliorated by lime incorporation (23% reduction compared with conventional urea). Urea + NBPT was effective in surface-limed and incorporated soils (up to 55.5% reduction). The results showed that soil management influences the efficiency of stabilized fertilizers and that urea + NBPT provides the best results.

TI  - Soil and crop residue CO2-C emission under tillage systems in sugarcane-producing areas of southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate management of agricultural crop residues could result in increases on soil organic carbon (SOC) and help to mitigate gas effect. To distinguish the contributions of SOC and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) residues to the short-term CO2-C loss, we studied the influence of several tillage systems: heavy offset disk harrow (HO), chisel plow (CP), rotary tiller (RT), and sugarcane mill tiller (SM) in 2008, and CP, RT, SM, moldboard (MP), and subsoiler (SUB) in 2009, with and without sugarcane residues relative to no-till (NT) in the sugarcane producing region of Brazil. Soil CO2-C emissions were measured daily for two weeks after tillage using portable soil respiration systems. Daily CO2-C emissions declined after tillage regardless of tillage system. In 2008, total CO2-C from SOC and/or residue decomposition was greater for RT and lowest for CP. In 2009, emission was greatest for MP and CP with residues, and smallest for NT. SOC and residue contributed 47 % and 41 %, respectively, to total CO2-C emissions. Regarding the estimated emissions from sugarcane residue and SOC decomposition within the measurement period, CO2-C factor was similar to sugarcane residue and soil organic carbon decomposition, depending on the tillage system applied. Our approach may define new emission factors that are associated to tillage operations on bare or sugarcane-residue-covered soils to estimate the total carbon loss.

TI  - Mechanical Intervention in Compacted No-Till Soil in Southern Brazil: Soil Physical Quality and Maize Yield
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The intense and successive use of mechanization in modern cropping systems has increased soil compaction under no-till areas. In this study, we aimed to assess the performance of a fixed shank coupled with a seeder for the mitigation of soil compaction induced by machinery traffic as an efficient alternative to replacing the chiseling and subsoiling operations in no-till areas. We evaluated a long-term experiment conducted in clay loam (Rhodic Haplustox) soil in southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted under a randomized block design, whose treatments consisted of three wheel-traffic intensities: 0 wheel-traffic (0 WT), 14 wheel-traffic (14 WT), and 28 wheel-traffic (28 WT), combined with four soil tillage mechanical interventions under a no-till field: no-till (NT), no-till with a fixed shank (NT + FS), soil chiseling (SC), and soil subsoiling (SS). The soil physical attributes evaluated were the soil penetration resistance (SPR), macroporosity (MaP), microporosity (MiP), total porosity (TP), bulk density (BD), field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs), S index, and plant-available water capacity (PAWC). In addition, three critical soil physical functions were evaluated by using a soil physical quality index (SPQI). The results showed that SPR was sensitive to soil compaction and captured differences among the mechanical intervention methods. Machinery traffic caused soil compaction, increasing SPR and reducing PAWC. Soil chiseling and subsoiling promoted lower BD, a higher TP, MaP, Kfs, and higher S index at the 0.05-0.15 m soil layer. Based on the SPQI, no changes were detected in the soil physical functions between NT and NT + FS. On the other hand, SC and SS enhanced soil physical functioning by 10%. We concluded that a 15-cm deep fixed shank could not mitigate the soil compaction induced by machinery traffic at the seeder operation. Therefore, this method is less effective in improving the soil's physical environment than chiseling and subsoiling operations. Finally, we encourage monitoring the persistence of these benefits on the soil over the subsequent crop seasons and in years with an intense water deficit along with the crop cycle.

TI  - Inbreeding depression from selfing and mating among relatives of Hymenaea courbaril L
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inbreeding in trees can result in inbreeding depression (ID), which may affect adaptation and growth of individuals that originate from self-fertilization and mating among relatives. To investigate how inbreeding can affect seed, and seedling growth, we used microsatellite loci to determine the mating system of a Hymenaea courbaril population and assess traits of seeds and seedlings for the expression of ID. Ninety-nine adult trees were mapped and genotyped and seeds collected from eight trees in a forest fragment in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Seed length and weight were measured and germinated seedlings that had been grown under nursery conditions were genotyped and measured for height and root collar diameter (RCD) at two-month intervals (7-17 months of age). Individual fixation index was estimated for each seedling, from which they were classified as originating from mating among unrelated parents (t(u)), related parents (t(r)), or selfing (s). This classification was confirmed using paternity analysis. Phenotypic means and ID of the measured traits were calculated for each determined s, t(r), and s + t(r) group. Mating was not random due to the occurrence of self-fertilization (1.3%), mating among relatives (5%), and correlated mating (15.6%). Biparental inbreeding was attributed to significant spatial genetic structure up to 250 m. The mean fixation index within familieswas significantly higher in seedlings (0.184) than in adults (-0.035), indicating ID from seedling to adult stages. The ID varied among seed and seedling traits throughout the study and between mating groups. Self-fertilization resulted in greater ID for seed length (8.5%) and weight (21.3%) than for t(r) (<7%). The ID for height and RCD of selfed individuals tended to decrease over the course of the study. The values for ID for seedling height and RCD of the group were greater (15.8-25.6% for both traits) than for the group t(r) (3.1-8.2%), with a total (s + t(r)) similar between height (7.6-9.4%) and RCD (8.1-10.5%). We recommend that seed collection is conducted across a large number of forest fragments in the region where the restoration is to be implemented, preferably in forests that are connected or as close as possible to other remnants, to mitigate the effects of ID in future generations. Seeds must be collected from a minimum of 47H. courbaril trees, respecting a minimum distance of 250 m between each tree to avoid collection of seeds from related individuals.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of shoreline change trends and adaptation in Bali Province, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change is a dynamic and complex phenomenon influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring these changes is crucial for understanding coastal dynamics, managing resources, and mitigating the impacts of coastal erosion and accretion. Remote sensing plays a vital role in monitoring shoreline change. This technology has emerged as a powerful tool for accessing and monitoring shoreline changes due to its ability to capture large-scale spatial data over different periods. This study investigated the dynamic changes in shoreline position in Bali Province from 2016 to 2021 using high-resolution PlanetScope imagery data. Multitemporal shorelines were extracted using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to delineate seawater from distinct land-cover types. The end point rate (EPR) model was then used to statistically quantify the shoreline change rates. The results revealed variations in the positions of the shorelines throughout the study, with rapid erosion emerging as a major concern in Bali Province, primarily driven by human activities and/or coastal hydrodynamics. During the study period, the shoreline in Bali Province decreased from 668.64 km to 662.59 km at an average rate of-1.21 m/yr due to continuous erosion, with the most significant retreat occurring at Klungkung Regency. On the other hand, human-caused shoreline advancement, such as land reclamation, harbor, and airport construction, has resulted in a net land increase of 1.25 km2. The protection strategies include structural interventions such as breakwaters and seawalls. The finding provides valuable information that will be helpful for coastal planning and management to reduce the loss of the economy and safeguard the future coastal environment in Bali's coastal areas.

TI  - CLUSTERING LOCAL PLANTS IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE OF THE KAMPAR RIVER, INDONESIA: TOWARDS AN AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role of biodiversity management strategies aimed at developing sustainable agricultural and food systems. Riparian vegetation management strategies are essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems, particularly through the selecting suitable plant species. The objective of this study is to analyze the riparian vegetation of the Kampar River basin and clustering species. The study was conducted in the riparian area of the Kampar River, Indonesia, across eight stations. The methods included phytosociological relev & eacute;s, cluster analysis, and ecophysiological indicator analysis. The study identified 38 dominant plant species in the riparian area of the Kampar River Basin on podsolic soils, grouped into five main clusters. On peatlands, 26 plant species were identified, organized into three clusters based on similarities in chemical and physical properties of soil and mesoclimatic factors. The identification and use of local plants that are well-adapted can be used to develop riparian vegetation management strategies and support sustainable agriculture in the riparian zone of the Kampar River Basin.

TI  - Harnessing social innovations and mobilizing networks for improving local livelihoods: cases of two community-managed forests from Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS TREES AND LIVELIHOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social forestry was envisioned as a policy innovation to tackle rural poverty. The literature increasingly shows that the goal is rarely achieved. Few mention social forestry improves local livelihoods, but many others point out the limited livelihood options provided to the communities. Recent literature highlights social innovation as a key factor in the success of social forestry. In this paper, we analyze the process by which social forestry permit holders harness social innovation to realize the promise of benefits from the forests. We focus on how they create networks with diverse stakeholders to gain the necessary resources to implement new ideas in utilizing the forests. We further analyze the key factors influencing the development of social innovation. We examine two rare cases from Indonesia where local communities thrived in the face of adversities and were able to turn them into opportunities to produce economic benefits. We identified resilience and adaptability as key internal attributes of the two communities to adapt to socio-ecological changes. Our cases also reveal the importance of building networks with related stakeholders. The success of social innovation is influenced by internal group factors such as persistence, leadership, as well as government policy and technical support.

TI  - From desertification to restoration in the Brazilian semiarid region: Unveiling the potential of land restoration on soil microbial properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land desertification poses a significant challenge in the Brazilian semiarid region, encompassing a substantial portion of the country. Within this region, the detrimental effects of human activities, particularly unsuitable anthropic actions, have resulted in diminished vegetation cover and an accelerated rate of soil erosion. Notably, practices such as overgrazing and the conversion of native forests into pasturelands have played a pivotal role in exacerbating the process of land desertification. Ultimately, land desertification results in significant losses of soil organic matter and microbial diversity. To address this pressing issue and contribute to the existing literature, various land restoration practices, such as grazing exclusion, cover crops, and terracing, have been implemented in the Brazilian semiarid. These practices have shown promising results in terms of enhancing soil fertility and restoring microbial properties. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in improving soil microbial properties in the Brazilian semiarid region remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent advances in molecular techniques have improved our understanding of microbial communities in lands undergoing desertification and restoration. In this review, we focus on assessing the effectiveness of these restoration practices in revitalizing soil microbial properties, with a particular emphasis on the soil microbiome and its functions. Through a critical assessment of the impact of these practices on soil microbial properties, our research aims to provide valuable insights that can help mitigate the adverse effects of desertification and promote sustainable development in this ecologically sensitive region.

TI  - Does Agroforestry Adoption Affect Subjective Well-Being? Empirical Evidence from Smallholder Farmers in East Java, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has an essential role in reducing global poverty and maintaining environmental sustainability. However, little is known about the association between agroforestry and farmers' welfare. This study aims to estimate the factors affecting agroforestry adoption and its impact on smallholder farmers' welfare. The cross-sectional data were collected from 301 potato farmers in East Java, Indonesia. The factors affecting farmers' decision to adopt agroforestry were estimated using probit regression analysis. The subjective well-being was proxied by life satisfaction and happiness. The effect of agroforestry adoption on subjective well-being was measured by propensity score matching (PSM). The findings indicated that agroforestry adoption was positively and significantly affected by whether the land is terraced, farmers' age and education level, and farmers' participation in social activities, cooperatives, and farmers' groups. The PSM analysis shows that agroforestry adoption has a significant and positive impact on both subjective well-being indicators. Farmers who adopted agroforestry were happier and more satisfied than those who did not. The findings imply that farmers should implement agroforestry in the long term to improve their well-being.

TI  - Decomposition and Nutrient Release Dynamics of Shoot Phytomass of Cover Crops in the Reconcavo Baiano
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the decomposition dynamics of vegetative residues from cover crops can provide a better understanding of nutrient release, which is fundamental when choosing a species that is adapted to local conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the decomposition rates and nutrient release dynamics of the shoot phytomass of different cover crops that have potential for agricultural use in the Reconcavo Baiano, Brazil. Crop residues of the following species were analyzed: sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) - CROT; velvet bean (Mucuna aterrima L.) - MUC; lab lab (Dolichos lab lab L.) - LAB; jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis [ L.] DC.) - JB; white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) - WLUP; and Guinea grass (Urochloa maxima ( Jacq.) R. Webster) - GRAS. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The decomposition and nutrient release dynamics were evaluated using litter bags, and the remaining dry matter and the nutrient content of litter from each cover crop were quantified. The accumulation of macronutrients in the phytomass was in the following order: N > K > Ca > Mg > P > S. The highest decomposition rates of the phytomass occurred in the species JB, with half-life (t(1/2)) of 36 days, and GRAS, with t(1/2) of 41 days. K was the element with the shortest t(1/2), suggesting a rapid transfer rate to the soil. Organic residues from the CROT and WLUP cover crops had lower decomposition rates and are, therefore, recommended for protecting soil in the region. Sunn hemp, unlike WLUP, also had residue of high chemical quality and, thus, it is an excellent nutrient recycler. Jack bean released nutrients into the soil the fastest due to its rapid decomposition rate; therefore, it is not recommended for ground cover.

AB  - Introduction: Inventories are essential for forest management, but, in the Amazon region, the absence of standardization produces information loss, low accuracy, and inconsistent measurements. This prevents valid comparisons and compromises the use of information in networks and software. Sampling unit size is of key importance in the inventory of native forests, particularly regarding accuracy and costs.Objective: To identify a plot size that provides adequate precision for dendrometric parameters in the Amazon.Methods: In Cotriguacu, Mato Grosso, Brazil, we tested four plot sizes with six repetitions each: 2 500, 5 000, 7 500, and 10 000 m(2). We measured diameter at breast height, population density, basal area, and biomass. We applied Shannon and Jaccard indexes; Weibull 2P and Gamma functions to fit the diametric distribution; and the Akaike Information Criterion for the best model.Results: There was a directly proportional relationship between plot area and population similarity, but diversity did not indicate significant alterations. Plot size did not affect dendrometric attributes and diametric distribution. Larger plot areas led to lower coefficients of variation and smaller confidence intervals. The Gamma function was the best model to represent the distributions of different plot sizes.Conclusions: For similar forests, we recommend the 2 500 m(2) plot to evaluate diameter at breast height, population density, basal area, and biomass.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Machine-Learning Techniques for Land Use and Land Cover Classification of the Brazilian Tropical Savanna Using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Polarimetric Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a workflow for land use and land cover (LULC) classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) images of the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado) biome. The following LULC classes were considered: forestlands; shrublands; grasslands; reforestations; croplands; pasturelands; bare soils/straws; urban areas; and water reservoirs. The proposed approach combines polarimetric attributes, image segmentation, and machine-learning procedures. A set of 125 attributes was generated using polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images, including the van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and Cloude-Pottier target decomposition components, incoherent polarimetric parameters (biomass indices and polarization ratios), and HH-, HV-, VH-, and VV-polarized amplitude images. These attributes were classified using the Naive Bayes (NB), DT J48 (DT = decision tree), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The RF, MLP, and SVM classifiers presented the most accurate performances. NB and DT J48 classifiers showed a lower performance in relation to the RF, MLP, and SVM. The DT J48 classifier was the most suitable algorithm for discriminating urban areas and natural vegetation cover. The proposed workflow can be replicated for other SAR images with different acquisition modes or for other types of vegetation domains.

TI  - Crop-Livestock Integrated Systems Improve Soil Health in Tropical Sandy Soils
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of pastures in tropical regions, particularly in sandy soils, poses significant challenges to sustainable agricultural practices. Crop-livestock integration (CLI) systems have emerged as a promising strategy to restore these degraded soils. This study evaluated the impact of land-use transitions on soil health in Western S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, focusing on the conversion from pasture (Urochloa brizantha) to CLI systems with U. brizantha (CLI-u) and M. maximum (CLI-m). A comprehensive set of chemicals (pH, phosphorus, potassium), physical (aggregate stability, bulk density), and biological (beta-glucosidase activity, soil organic carbon) indicators were assessed across four land-use types: native vegetation (NV), pasture (PA), CLI-u, and CLI-m. The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was applied to calculate the Soil Health Index (SHI) across three soil depths (0-0.1 m, 0.1-0.2 m, 0.2-0.3 m). At the surface layer (0-0.1 m), PA and NV exhibited the highest SHI values (0.65 and 0.63, respectively), while CLI-m showed a lower SHI (0.56). In the subsurface layer (0.1-0.2 m), CLI-m and NV presented the highest SHI values (0.66 and 0.67, respectively), whereas PA and CLI-u had lower values (0.52 and 0.58). At the deepest layer (0.2-0.3 m), SHI values in CLI systems were comparable to NV (0.56), while PA recorded the lowest SHI (0.48). These results demonstrate that land-use transitions and management practices significantly affect soil health in sandy soils. The findings underscore the potential of CLI systems, particularly those incorporating M. maximum, to enhance biological and chemical soil health indicators in tropical agroecosystems. Further refinement of CLI management strategies is essential to optimize soil health recovery in sandy soil ecosystems.

TI  - Crop-livestock integration and the physical resilience of a degraded Latosol
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of pastures in Brazil is a problem of agronomic and environmental importance because it impairs the productive capacity of the soil and the hydrological cycle. In this context, the integration of agriculture and livestock emerges as a promising practice in recovering degraded soils through aggregation, increasing organic carbon in the soil and breaking compacted layers via the growth of grass roots. This study aimed to evaluate suitable indicators of physical quality in regard to mitigating structural changes of a Latosol cultivated with different species of the genus Brachiaria. We evaluated the grasses Brachiaria brizantha (Xaraes, Piata, Marandu), Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria ruziziensis and adopted fallow and conventional tillage as controls. Soil samples were used to evaluate the parameters total organic carbon, soil aggregation via wet sieving and the least limiting water range (LLWR). Total organic carbon and aggregate stability were not suitable indicators for quantifying soil structural changes, remaining high in the evaluated conservation systems, with a difference observed only in the control with conventional tillage. The LLWR varied among all systems and layers evaluated. Xaraes palisadegrass, followed by the Piata and Marandu cultivars, stood out in terms of biological soil loosening ability, being similar to the recovery caused by soil tillage. Furthermore, B. decumbens showed intermediate performance, while B. ruziziensis showed activity similar to that in the fallow treatment, indicating limited potential for soil physical recovery.

TI  - Short-term spatiotemporal variation of soil CO2emission, temperature, moisture and aeration in sugarcane field reform areas under the influence of precipitation events
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil CO(2)emission (FCO2) in agricultural areas results from the interaction of different factors such as climate and soil conditions. Our objective was to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of FCO2, temperature (T-soil), moisture (M-soil) and air-filled pore space (AFPS), as well as their interactions, during the sugarcane field reform. The study was conducted on a 90 x 90 m sampling grid with 100 points at 10 m spacings. Ten assessments of FCO2, T(soil)and M(soil)were carried out at each point over a 28-day period. The greatest mean values of FCO2(0.74 g m(-2) hr(-1)) and M-soil(31.7%) were obtained on Julian day 276, 2013, being associated with precipitation events at the study site. Also, the smallest values of AFPS (19.17%) and T-soil(20.90 degrees C) were observed on the same day. The spatial variability of FCO2, T-soil, M(soil)and AFPS was best described by an adjusted spherical model, although an exponential model better fitted some results. The spatial pattern of all soil attributes showed little temporal persistency, indicating a high complexity for FCO(2)during precipitation. Correlation maps assisted in identifying regions where M(soil)and AFPS better controlled the emission process and where T(soil)was important. A major challenge for world agriculture is to increase the efficiency of conventional soil management practices. We highlight the importance of the spatial pattern of soil properties that directly influence the CO(2)emission dynamics. Future mitigation actions should involve less intense tillage and ensure homogeneous applications of soil inputs, thereby reducing production costs and the contribution of these activities to CO(2)emissions during the sugarcane field reform.

TI  - Analysis of information used in the management of plant genetic resources: a case study from northwestern Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation and monitoring are critical to agroforestry (AFS) project management, especially if they aim to contribute to use and conservation of biodiversity and plant genetic resources. A methodology to analyze information used in decision-making processes was developed and applied in a biodiversity conservation project in the Brazilian Amazon. Quality of information gathered at landscape, AFS, species (Bactris gasipaes Kunth, both wild and cultivated varieties) and genetic diversity levels in three dimensions was analyzed. The information at the landscape level was good, while that in the organizational-institutional and socio-economic dimensions was acceptable; information gaps were serious in the genetic-ecological dimension. Ecological and economic functionality assessment based on indicators built upon reported administrative actions suggests that information related to conservation played a greater role in decision-making and management than information associated with use and development. The application of the methodology proved instrumental for enhancing efficacy of decision-making within an adaptive management approach to plant genetic resources use and conservation.

TI  - Liming and Plastering Modify Root Anatomy in Pennisetum purpureum Schum
T2  - International Journal of Plant Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) exhibits high biomass production, is readily accepted by animals, and demonstrates good adaptation to the various soil types. Consequently, the utilization of P. purpureum shows promise in amending surface and subsurface soil acidity, thereby contributing to increased crop yield while enhancing water and nutrient utilization efficiency. In this study, the effects of corrective processes involving limestone and plastering on the root anatomy of P. purpureum were investigated. Roots subjected to different treatments were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in historesin. Subsequently, samples were sectioned in a microtome, stained with toluidine blue for the conventional analysis, or submitted to the histochemical test. The qualitative and quantitative anatomical analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of liming and plastering on the root structure of P. purpureum. The results showed that liming led to an increase in both the number and diameter of vessel elements, while plastering reduced these parameters compared to the acidic soils. Additionally, liming induced the formation of suberized endodermal cell walls. These findings highlight the significance of effective soil management to obtain P. purpureum plants with a well-developed vascular system, thereby promoting optimal plant performance in agricultural crops.

AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) has been detected in Bandung since 2001 and it can be mitigated by planting trees such as Pterocarpus indicus (angsana), Swietenia macrophylla (mahogany), and Samanea saman (trembesi). This research was conducted to measure temperature reduction by those road side trees at seven locations. Parameters were tree characteristics including shape and area of canopy, Plant Area Index (PAI), and leaf morphology (shape and arrangement), air temperature, relative air humidity, transmissivity, and surface temperature. Microclimate and edaphic data were measured in sunny day or partly cloudy. Data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) to clarify significance differences among parameters in each tree species and measured reduction of discomfort index (dDI%). Air temperature in open area is 33.81 +/- 2.32 degrees C, while surface temperature is 37.29 +/- 6.63 degrees C. Result shows that trees have varies ability to decrease air and surface temperature. The highest reduction of air (A) and surface (S) temperature is shown by S. saman (A=3.80 +/- 1.21 degrees C and S=10.49 +/- 2.84 degrees C), then followed by S. macrophylla (A=3.10 +/- 1.94 degrees C and S=5.64 +/- 5.51 degrees C), and P. indicus (A=2.28 +/- 1.73 degrees C and S=5.26 +/- 4.30 degrees C). S. saman which has wide canopy with moderate leaf density can reduce air and surface temperature effectively, followed by S. macrophylla with narrow canopy and high leaf density; and P. indicus with narrow canopy with low leaf density. Thus, tree character with broad canopy and dense leaves such as S. saman can be recommended as shading tree to mitigate UHI in urban areas.

TI  - Responses of soil respiration and organic carbon to organic soil amendments in upland paddy
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for 60% of the total greenhouse effect. Soil respiration is a measure of the CO2 released from soil. Rice was the largest contributing plant commodity of total emission by 12%. In the event of growing threats of global warming due to GHG emissions, reducing CO2 emission by sequestering C in the soil is of supreme concernment. Improved management practices can rebuild C stocks in agricultural soils and help mitigate CO2 emissions. A field study to assess how organic soil amendments influence soil respiration, C-organic content, and soil properties was conducted in upland paddy field. Treatments were: chemical fertilizer (F1), combination of chemical fertilizer and cow dung manure (F2), chemical fertilizer and vermicompost (F3), chemical fertilizer and liquid vermicompost powder (F4), cow dung manure+biochar (F5), vermicompost+biochar (F6) and liquid vermicompost powder+biochar (F7). All treatments tested almost had the same pattern of respiration rates starting before the application of the organic soil amendment until three months after planting. The highest respiration rate was found at 1 month after planting. Soil amendment (F4 and F7) had the lowest soil respiration rates in some measurements. The highest organic C content at three months after planting was found in the F6 and F3 treatments. The most influential factor on the respiration rate are soil moisture content and soil temperature. The results demonstrate the viability of vermicompost either in combination with chemical fertilizers or alone for soil amendment to maintain organic soil carbon for short period of time (similar to 3 months).

TI  - Implementing and Monitoring the Use of Artificial Canopy Bridges by Mammals and Birds in an Indonesian Agroforestry Environment
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical forest habitats. Some of the fastest diminishing tropical forest habitats in the world occur in Indonesia, where fragmentation is severely impacting biodiversity, including on the island of Java, which holds many endemic species. Extreme fragmentation on the western part of the island, especially due to small-scale agriculture, impacts animal movement and increases mortality risk for mainly arboreal taxa. To mitigate this risk in an agroforest environment in Garut District, West Java, we installed 10 canopy bridges and monitored them through camera trapping between 2017 and 2019. Five of the monitored bridges were made of waterlines and five of rubber hose. We recorded Javan palm civets using the waterline bridges 938 times, while Javan slow lorises used the waterlines 1079 times and the rubber bridges 358 times. At least 19 other species used the bridges for crossing or perching. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple and cost-effective materials can be used to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. We also recommend the use of camera traps to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions.

TI  - Biodiversity Impacts of Increased Ethanol Production in Brazil
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing domestic and international ethanol demand is expected to result in increased sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion currently results in land-use changes mainly in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, two severely threatened biodiversity hotspots. This study quantifies potential biodiversity impacts of increased ethanol demand in Brazil in a spatially explicit manner. We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals' species richness up to 2030. Decreased potential species richness due to increased ethanol demand in 2030 was projected for about 19,000 km(2) in the Cerrado, 17,000 km(2) in the Atlantic Forest, and 7000 km(2) in the Pantanal. In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change. This study provides a first indication of biodiversity impacts related to increased ethanol production in Brazil, which is useful for policy makers and ethanol producers aiming to mitigate impacts. Future research should assess the impact of potential mitigation options, such as nature protection, agroforestry, or agricultural intensification.

TI  - Microclimate and pasture area preferences by dairy cows under high biodiversity silvopastoral system in Southern Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of microclimate on dairy cows' behaviors and their preferences for different pasture areas under high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnuclei) in a subtropical climate. We surveyed three different pasture areas under SPSnuclei: shaded area around the nuclei (SAN), unshaded area around the nuclei (UAN), and all-day sunny area distant from the nuclei (SDN). In each area, the microclimatic variables were measured-air temperature (degrees C), relative humidity (%), illuminance (lux), wind speed (m/s), and soil surface temperature (degrees C). In addition, the diurnal behaviors of 39 Jersey dairy cows were evaluated. Grazing, standing rest, lying rest, standing rumination, and lying rumination were registered by scans every 10 min; drinking water was observed continuously. Microclimate differed (p < 0.05) among the SPSnuclei areas. Areas around the nuclei provided better conditions of air temperature (SAN, 31.05 degrees C; UAN, 31.92 degrees C; SDN, 33.39 degrees C), illuminance (SAN, 5665 lx; UAN, 61,065 lx; SDN, 75,380 lx), and soil surface temperature (SAN, 27.35 degrees C; UAN, 32.38 degrees C; SDN, 35.87 degrees C). The frequency of use of each SPSnuclei area by dairy cows was different (p < 0.01); the highest frequencies of the grazing (SAN, 12.6%; UAN, 4.8%; SDN, 11.1%), rumination (SAN, 21.7%; UAN, 3.1%; SDN, 1.9%), and rest (SAN, 35.6%; UAN, 5.4%; SDN, 3.7%) were registered in the areas around the nuclei. The microclimate of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system leads the animals to perform grazing, ruminating, and resting preferentially on the areas around the nuclei even with no shade.

TI  - Significance of macroporosity and hydrology for soil management and sustainability of agricultural production in a humid-tropical environment
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes soil-related agronomic constraints in the Sitiung region of Indonesia that are directly related to low nutrient-holding capacity, macroporosity, and rainfall regime. This region receives 2500 to 3000 mm of rainfall per year; but nearly 50% of the rainfall is disposed of rapidly via internal drainage. Although rapid internal drainage reduces the risks of erosion, it leads to infertility, acidity, and Al toxicity. The physical structure of the soils is: characterized by stable aggregates, with numerous macropores in the surface and a predominantly microporous subsoil matrix interspersed with a few larger macropores. Macropores account for about 29% of porosity in the surface and between 3 and 6% in the subsoil. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix containing macropores averages about 300 to 400 cm/day, whereas that of the microporous matrix is generally <1 cm/day. The structure facilitates rapid infiltration and leaching of rainfall. However, little opportunity exists for nutrients moving downward with drainage water to accumulate in the subsoil. The main reason for this seems to be the low hydraulic conductivity and the, preponderance of excessive wetness in the subsoil, Drying seems to be essential for movement of nutrients into the subsoil matrix, However, most of the agronomic crops are sensitive to Al toxicity and fail to grow roots deeper than: 10 to 15 crh. Thus, they suffer from water stress, despite heavy and frequent rainfall, and fail to cause drying of the subsoil, Problems of acidity; AZ toxicity, and infertility worsen progressively where agricultural production consists mainly of Al-sensitive crops. Although liming with calcium carbonate improves the soil chemical environment, downward movement of lime is very slow. Deep: liming is effective in improving rooting depth, crop water availability, and drying of the subsoil, but the technology is cost- and labor-intensive. Native vegetation, on the other hand, is able: to:grow roots to considerable depths and causes significant drying of the subsoil, even without soil amendments. Thus, production systems: in which locally adapted vegetation of economic value is the-main focus: seem to be more sustainable and conducive to improving soil conditions.

TI  - Photochemical attributes determine the responses of plant species from different functional groups of ferruginous outcrops when grown in iron mining substrates
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environments originating from banded iron formations, such as the canga, are important reference ecosystems for the recovery of degraded areas by mining. The objective of this work was to evaluate if the relationship between morphofunctional and photosynthetic attributes of native canga species from different functional group results in distinct responses when grown in iron mining tailings substrate. The experiment was carried out with species belonging to different functional groups: a widespread semi-deciduous tree-shrub, Myrcia splendens; an endemic deciduous shrub, Jacaranda caroba; and a nitrogen-fixing herbaceous species, Periandra mediterranea. The species were grown in two conditions, reference soil and iron ore tailing. Despite belonging to different functional groups when grown in tailings, the morphofunctional attributes presented similar responses between species. M. splendens was the species most affected by the conditions imposed by the iron ore mining tailings, with decreased light-use efficiency and electron transport. P. mediterranea had satisfactory growth and maintenance of photosynthetic attributes. J. caroba growing in the tailings increased the effective quantum yield of PSII. The photochemical and growth assessments were able to better explain the adaptive strategies developed by the species, guaranteeing a greater chance of success during the rehabilitation of mining substrates.

TI  - Effects of land use, tillage management, and crop diversification on soil physical quality in Cerrado agricultural systems
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable agricultural intensificationhas been considered one of the solutions for increasing food production and mitigating climate changes. Nevertheless, soil physical degradation induced by intense mechanization may threaten those benefits in large-scale agricultural regions such as the Brazilian Cerrado. Thus, our study aimed to assess the effects of land use, tillage management, and crop diversification on soil physical quality of two long-term experiments in Cerrado through on-farm visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) and soil physical parameters. Soil sampling was performed in 0-to-10- and 10-to-20-cm layers of four agricultural systems: soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-fallow under conventional tillage (SF); soybean-fallow under no-till (SN); soybean-maize (Zea mays L.) succession under no-till (SM); and crop rotation under no-till including soybean, maize, grasses, and legumes (CR). An additional area of native Cerrado vegetation (NV) was included as reference. Land transition from Cerrado to agricultural systems declined the soil physical quality, detected by VESS assessment and physical parameters in both layers. Tillage management did not alter soil physical parameters, which was likely associated with the medium time adoption in the experiments (9 yr) and high resilience capacity of clayey Oxisols. Unexpectedly, SM and CR negatively affected the porosity- and water-associated soil parameters in the 10-to-20-cm layer compared with SN. It suggests that the soil physical damage induced by higher frequency of machinery operations required to manage a more diverse crop sequence may prevail over the benefits provided by crop diversification. Finally, this study highlights that intensified agricultural systems need to be coupled with strategies to reduce and/or control intensive machinery traffic.

TI  - Spatiotemporal trends of forest cover change in Southeast Asia
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The current state of tropical forest cover and its change have been identified as key variables in modelling and measuring the consequences of human action on ecosystems. The conversion of tropical forest cover to any other land cover (deforestation) directly contributes to the two main environmental threats of the recent past: 1) the alteration of the global climate by the emission of carbon to the atmosphere and 2) the decline in tropical biodiversity by land use intensification and habitat conversion. The sub-continent of Southeast Asia exhibits one of the highest rates of forest loss and comprises one of the regions with the highest amount and diversity of flora and fauna species, worldwide.The knowledge of the spatial and temporal trends in the variation of forest cover in tropical regions is a prerequisite for the development and establishment of mitigation strategies from the global to the regional level. However, there is considerable disagreement in recent estimates of tropical forest cover change ranging from continuing and intensified decline in forest loss to a distinct decrease in deforestation rates and up to stagnation in other cases. Against this background, the present study aims at a review and comparison of recently available global forest cover estimates for the region of Southeast Asia. In a case study, the results at the national level will be compared to an analysis at the regional level for the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The outcome of the study provides recommendations for future remote sensing based forest assessments in tropical regions.

TI  - Multivariate analysis as a tool in the selection of sustainable melon agroecosystems in the semi-arid region
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - -Soil management systems, including tillage and green manuring, are important for the control of nematodes and for the sustainable production. The objective was to select, through multivariate analysis, sustainable agroecosystems for yellow melon cultivated under irrigated conditions in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The long-term experiment is set up in Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo (Ultisol) with six multifunctional agroecosystems, composed of the combination of three mixtures of cover crops (1 -75% legumes + 25% grasses and oilseeds; 2 -25% legumes + 75% grasses and oilseeds and 3 -spontaneous vegetation) and two types of soil management (no tillage-NT and tillage-T). The purpose was to evaluate the nutritional status of plants, soil fertility, nematode population in roots and soil, and the yield. Data were analyzed with multivariate techniques, allowing the grouping of the agroecosystems based on their similarities and complexity of functions. The incorporation of plant residues to the soil reduces nematode population, but their maintenance on the surface allows the improvement of fertility and yield, even under larger nematode populations. The agroecosystems that associate the non -incorporation of residues from cover crops with larger species diversity in composition constitute the most complex model, allowing different environmental functionalities. Thus, it is recommended not to incorporate the plant residues, planting the melon seedlings directly in the straw. However, considering that the results obtained with the non-incorporation of spontaneous vegetation were similar to those obtained with the incorporation of commercial cover crops, it is concluded that this practice is also viable and adapted to the semi-arid conditions.

TI  - Fertilizer shanks to promote soil decompaction in the seeding operation
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of soil compaction process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating the search for alternatives to mitigate soil compaction state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder with fertilizer shanks at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The study was conducted in a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S-0.10m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0.10m depth; S-0.15m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0.15m depth and, D-0.07m: double discs lagged acting to 0.07m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder with fertilizer shanks acting at 0.15m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer.

TI  - The Stability of Aggregates in Different Amazonian Agroecosystems Is Influenced by the Texture, Acidity, and Availability of Ca and Mg in the Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The processes of occupation and exploitation in the Amazon have been increasing, and as a consequence, forest areas are being replaced by agroecosystems. As a consequence of this change, changes have been occurring in the soil attributes, and consequently, in the stability of aggregates in these environments. Thus, this work had two objectives: the first was to evaluate the impacts generated by the conversion of forests into agroecosystems on the soil attributes that are related to aggregates, in the southwestern region of the Amazon; the second objective was to evaluate the roles of pedophysical and pedochemical parameters on the stability of soil aggregates. The study was carried out on rural properties located in the southern part of Amazonas State, Brazil. Eight areas under different agroecosystems were selected: in the municipality of Canutama: (i) annatto, (ii) guarana, and (iii) cupuassu; in the municipality of Humait & aacute;: (iv) cassava, (v) agroforestry, and (vi) sugarcane; and in the municipality of Manicor & eacute;: (vii) pasture and (viii) native forest. Unformed soil samples were collected from the 0.00-0.10 m layer and analyzed for aggregate stability, bulk density, soil organic carbon, and soil organic carbon stock. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. The largest soil aggregations occurred in the annatto, guarana, sugarcane, and pasture agroecosystems. We associate the greater aggregation capacity of soils with factors that are inherent to the cultivated species and soil properties. The first factor corresponds to the adaptability of the Amazonian and grass species and their ability to produce biomass. The second factor is related to the physical and chemical properties of Amazonian soils, largely influenced by the sand fraction, soil organic carbon, soil acidity, and availability of exchangeable Ca and Mg.

TI  - Three decades of deforestation in southwest Sumatra: Effects of coffee prices, law enforcement and rural poverty
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ conservation of tropical forests often requires restricting human use and occupancy within protected areas by enforcing regulations. However, law enforcement interventions that seek to prevent deforestation rarely have been evaluated. Conservationists increasingly recognize the need to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, using an indicator of biodiversity change, such as rate of deforestation, and a counterfactual approach that addresses a fundamental question: what would have happened had there been no intervention? This study examines how law enforcement can mitigate habitat loss from small-holder coffee growing by comparing 34 years of empirical data on deforestation rates and coffee prices across a zone of high law enforcement and a zone of low law enforcement using satellite imagery, ecological data, interviews, and GIS modeling..In the early 1980s strong law enforcement efforts were found to reduce deforestation inside Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP), southwest Sumatra. However, law enforcement efforts were weak in remote areas of BBSNP, where high coffee prices spurred rapid deforestation. Furthermore, law enforcement efforts were reversed by the 1997-1998 Asian economic crisis. the fall of the national president, and by new regulations surrounding regional autonomy. These findings indicate that law enforcement is critical but insufficient alone. They also highlight that rising costs of agricultural commodities can be detrimental to tropical forests and their associated biodiversity. In the long run one must act to decrease the incentives for coffee cultivation. A multi-faceted strategy that includes law enforcement and incentives to reduce poverty around PAS is proposed.

TI  - Committed carbon emissions, deforestation, and community land conversion from oil palm plantation expansion in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial agricultural plantations are a rapidly increasing yet largely unmeasured source of tropical land cover change. Here, we evaluate impacts of oil palm plantation development on land cover, carbon flux, and agrarian community lands in West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. With a spatially explicit land change/carbon bookkeeping model, parameterized using high-resolution satellite time series and informed by socioeconomic surveys, we assess previous and project future plantation expansion under five scenarios. Although fire was the primary proximate cause of 1989-2008 deforestation (93%) and net carbonemissions (69%), by 2007-2008, oil palm directly caused 27% of total and 40% of peatland deforestation. Plantation land sources exhibited distinctive temporal dynamics, comprising 81% forests on mineral soils (1994-2001), shifting to 69% peatlands (2008-2011). Plantation leases reveal vast development potential. In 2008, leases spanned similar to 65% of the region, including 62% on peatlands and 59% of community-managed lands, yet < 10% of lease area was planted. Projecting business as usual (BAU), by 2020 similar to 40% of regional and 35% of community lands are cleared for oil palm, generating 26% of net carbon emissions. Intact forest cover declines to 4%, and the proportion of emissions sourced from peatlands increases 38%. Prohibiting intact and logged forest and peatland conversion to oil palm reduces emissions only 4% below BAU, because of continued uncontrolled fire. Protecting logged forests achieves greater carbon emissions reductions (21%) than protecting intact forests alone (9%) and is critical for mitigating carbon emissions. Extensive allocated leases constrain land management options, requiring trade-offs among oil palm production, carbon emissions mitigation, and maintaining community landholdings.

TI  - Assessing N2O Emissions from Tropical Crop Cultivation in Mineral and Peatland Soils: A Review
T2  - CARAKA TANI-JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) emissions from agricultural activities contribute significantly to global warming. Understanding the factors influencing N2O 2 O emissions is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This review assesses N2O 2 O emissions from various crops cultivated in tropical mineral and peatland soils, providing insights into the impact of land use, fertilization practices and rainfall on N2O 2 O fluxes. Field measurements of N2O 2 O fluxes were conducted in agricultural fields growing corn, peanuts, and cassava in Bogor Regency, West Java Province, as well as in peatland areas with Acacia plantations and natural primary forests in Bengkalis Regency, Riau Province. The study assesses the total N2O 2 O fluxes for each crop and land type, revealing significant variations in N2O 2 O emissions among different crops and land uses. Peatland areas exhibit higher emissions compared to mineral soils, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation measures in these ecosystems. The findings highlight the importance of considering the type and age of land use when evaluating N2O 2 O emissions. Land management practices, such as fertilizer use and soil disturbance, emerge as critical factors affecting N2O 2 O emissions. Improper fertilizer application and excessive soil disturbance can lead to increased N2O 2 O emissions, underscoring the necessity for careful N fertilizer management and conservation tillage techniques.

TI  - The cation exchange capacity of a sandy soil in southern Brazil: an estimation of permanent and pH-dependent charges
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In soils in general, the cation exchange capacity is an important factor in soil fertility because it determines both cation retention and selectivity, and in turn controls most of the other soil properties. The main goal of this paper was to estimate the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the contribution of permanent charges and pH-dependent charges and their respective importance in soil CEC as a function of pH, clay and organic matter content in soils. A multiple regression method was developed from 75 samples under different soil management practices. The permanent charge (similar to 140 mmol(c) kg(-1) of clay) estimated by this approach was independent of the analytical method used, i.e. a French method (MF) and a Brazilian method (MB), and is consistent with the presence of 2:1 clay minerals. However, the pH-dependent charges were closely related to the buffering capacity inherent in each protocol (MF protocol using NH4+, and MB using a SMP solution proposed earlier by other workers, both at pH 7). For the MF protocol, the proposed method appeared to be well adapted for reproducing soil component properties under different management conditions. In the soil samples studied, the contribution of organic carbon to negative charges ranged from 12.3 to 55.8% of effective CEC and from 14.1 to 59.2% of CEC at pH 7. However, the clay contribution, notably its permanent charges, can contribute to 31% and more of the CEC in the lower horizons of soil profiles. The proposed approach can accurately evaluate the effective and pH 7 CECs when the MF protocol is used but evaluation is less accurate with the MB protocol.

TI  - Evolution of crop yields in different tillage and cropping systems over two decades in southern Brazil
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last three decades, the no-tillage system (NT) has provided environmental and economic advantages for farming in southern Brazil, especially when associated with crop rotation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different tillage and cropping systems on the grain yields of soybean, maize and wheat, in a 23-year experiment established on an Oxisol in the southern region of Brazil. The experiment was carried out in randomized block experimental design with four replications. The treatments consisted of three tillage systems [NT, NT with chiseling every three years (NTC), and conventional tillage (CT)] and two cropping systems [an annual crop sequence with wheat in the winter and soybean in the summer, designated as crop succession (CS), and a 4-year crop rotation with the following species in winter-summer, respectively: white lupine-maize; black oat-soybean; wheat-soybean; and wheat-soybean (CR)]. Soybean yields were correlated to the water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI) estimated for the soybean reproductive period. With few exceptions, the NT showed higher soybean yields in relation to CT from the 7th year of the experiment onwards, especially under crop rotation and in growing seasons with lower water availability expressed by lower WRSI values. The percentage of NT soybean yield advantage over CT increased consistently over the time, and this increase was greater in CR than in CS, reaching on average 23%. The yields of wheat and maize were not influenced by the tillage systems, but the wheat yields were increased by crop rotation. In the most of the growing seasons, the soil chiseling, at every three years, did not increase significantly the yields of soybean, maize and wheat. Crop rotation and NT, allowed high and stable crop yields, especially under water-stress conditions. Results indicate the need of minimizing soil disturbance and diversifying cropping system for sustainable grain production in southern Brazil. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interactive effects of fire and grazing on vegetation structure and plant species composition in subtropical grasslands
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionFire and grazing, and their interaction, are the main drivers of vegetation structure and plant species composition in many grasslands globally. However, for subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil, the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant community composition characteristics remain relatively understudied, even though this ecosystem is recognized as fire-dependent with critical importance for livestock grazing.LocationSubtropical grassland in southern Brazil (Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul state).MethodsBeginning in 2017, we established an experiment with three treatments: fire only (F), grazing only (G), and fire and grazing (F + G). Grazing was continuous with ca 1.1 animal unit per hectare annually and prescribed fires were applied annually in winter. We assessed vegetation structure (via percentage of bare soil, height of canopy, and available forage) and plant species composition during spring (November) and summer (March) of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (only summer season).ResultsDifferences in vegetation structure were found among treatments, wherein bare soil, height of canopy and available forage were higher in F, and lower but similar in F + G and G. Plant species richness was equal among treatments, but cover of C3 grasses was higher in F than in other treatments, and shrub cover was lower in F and F + G in comparison to G. In F + G treatment, available biomass for subsequent burning was limited, resulting in lower amounts of fuel, reduced fire spread, and ultimately less total area burned in the subsequent years.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that interaction of fire and grazing can be a useful vegetation management tool for conserving native plant species, increasing availability of more desirable forage plants, and decreasing shrubs (including toxic Senecio species which contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids). The singular and interactive effects of fire and grazing suggest the subhumid R & iacute;o de la Plata grasslands are a fire-adapted ecosystem with variable plant functional trait responses facilitating differential dominance. There is a need for future work to address spatio-temporal variability and vegetation heterogeneity.Fire and grazing, and their interaction, are the main drivers of vegetation structure and plant species composition in many grasslands globally.

TI  - Urban Gardens and Soil Compaction: a Land Use Alternative for Runoff Decrease
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - After several landscape transformations caused by human activities, finding a suitable environment becomes increasingly challenging in urbanized regions. The predominance of non-permeable areas results in a low level of water infiltration. Notwithstanding, even green areas can have high runoff rates, since soil compaction has a decisive influence on the water movement. In places that have a natural predisposition to overflow, these problems are more significant. This study aimed to investigate causes of flooding, highlight the benefits of urban gardening and to propose urban gardening as an alternative to soil improvement in the Corujas Watershed, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The evaluation was based on: (a) the physical characteristics of the watershed, provided by morphometric analysis and land-use analysis; and (b) the soil compaction rates of an urban garden compared to a riparian forest and a grass area. The morphometric results indicated that the watershed has a significant flood tendency, and the land use map demonstrated that 29.55 % of the soil has some permeability. Nevertheless, this permeability currently varies according to soil management and cover. The grass area presented the highest compaction rates, the riparian forest a medium rate, and Corujas Garden the lowest rate. The garden also has green infrastructures and good management practices, which have led to the appearance and perpetuation of diffuse springs. These results showed that the urban garden activities could improve the physical characteristics of the soil and optimize water infiltration. Subsequent studies will investigate whether this characteristic also applies to other gardens located in different urban watersheds.

TI  - Do exogenous application of thiamine mitigates low soil base saturation effects on bell pepper plants? br
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensive use of land to produce vegetables results in high soil degradation and cultivated area. The use of techniques and resources that make production possible under unfavorable conditions can be decisive for agriculture. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the isolated and joint effects of liming and thiamine application on the development of bell pepper plants. The treatments consisted of three different soil base saturation (36, 60, and 80%), combined with foliar application of thiamine (with and without) at a concentration of 100 mg L-1. It was found that thiamine mitigates the effects of low base saturation on the physiological traits of bell pepper plants. The increments related to the water use efficiency and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency allowed greater development of plants treated with thiamine. In addition, the application of thiamine is advantageous in cases where planting is carried out under conditions of low base saturation, followed by an adequate supply of nutrients or systems in which there is a partial or total correction of the soil chemical characteristics, promoting the development of plants and increased physiological activity.

TI  - Choice of macroinvertebrate metrics to evaluate stream conditions in Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of biomonitoring programs based on the macroinvertebrate community requires the understanding of species distribution patterns, as well as of the responses of the community to anthropogenic stressors. In this study, 49 metrics were tested as potential means of assessing the condition of 29 first- and second-order streams located in areas of differing types of land use in So Paulo State, Brazil. Of the sampled streams, 15 were in well-preserved regions in the Atlantic Forest, 5 were among sugarcane cultivations, 5 were in areas of pasture, and 4 were among eucalyptus plantations. The metrics were assessed against the following criteria: (1) predictable response to the impact of human activity; (2) highest taxonomic resolution, and (3) operational and theoretical simplicity. We found that 18 metrics were correlated with the environmental and spatial predictors used, and seven of these satisfied the selection criteria and are thus candidates for inclusion in a multimetric system to assess low-order streams in So Paulo State. These metrics are family richness; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) richness; proportion of Megaloptera and Hirudinea; proportion of EPT; Shannon diversity index for genus; and adapted Biological Monitoring Work Party biotic index.

TI  - Cover crop management systems improves soil quality and mitigate water erosion in tropical olive orchards
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of olive trees in shallow soils in hillslopes requires adequate soil and water conservation systems. In this context, soil use and management besides vegetation cover contributes to better soil quality and the sustainability of the olive cultivation system. Thus, the objective was to determine the physical and chemical properties that are indicative of soil quality in areas of Dystrudepts, under different soil cover management systems in olive cultivation in tropical region. Olive tree culture field experiment was established in 2015, where soil was sampled over three years (2016, 2017 and 2021). The effect of five cover management systems were compared for each agricultural year, namely BS: bare soil in 2015/2016, 2016/2017 and 2017/2021; OBS: olive trees on bare soil in 2015/2016, 2016/2017 and 2017/2021; OSV: olive trees intercropped with mowed spontaneous vegetation in 2015/2016, 2016/2017 and 2017/2021; OJB: olive trees intercropped with jack beans (Canavalia ensiformis L.) in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, and olive trees crowned intercropped with mowed spontaneous vegetation in 2017/2021; OMI: olive trees intercropped with millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) in 2015/2016, olive trees intercropped with sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) in 2015/2017 and olive trees with spontaneous vegetations treated with herbicide (Roundup) in 2017/2021. The soil quality indices (SQI) proved to be sensitive to variations in different types of soil management from the second year of assessment, regarding water erosion. OSV and OJB showed the highest SQI, while OBS showed the lowest values. The SQI demonstrated an inverse correlation with soil and water losses starting from the second year of assessment. This highlights its efficacy in assessment the effects of adopted management on soil quality in the context of water erosion. Moreover, it reinforces the importance of vegetation cover in maintaining soil fertility, resulting in increase of soil organic matter and improving the structuring of Dystrudepts. The attributes that most correlated with the SQI were soil organic matter, effective cation exchange capacity, sum of bases, geometric mean diameter of aggregates, pH and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity. These attributes collectively provide valuable insights into soil health and water erosion susceptibility within the olive tree production system.

TI  - Water infiltration rate in Yellow Latosol under different soil management systems
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The management systems affect soil structure, causing changes in porosity that can influence soil water infiltration. In order to study the water infiltration rate in a Yellow Latosol under different tillage systems and different mathematical models, an experiment was conducted from October to December 2012, at the Center for Agricultural Sciences at the Federal University of Alagoas, using a randomized block design with five replicates, in a split-plot scheme. In the plots, the management systems were evaluated (conventional tillage, no-tillage and minimum tillage) and, in the sub-plots, the empirical mathematical models of Kostiakov, Kostiakov-Lewis and Horton, and the ring method. The method used to measure soil water infiltration rate was adapted from the classic double-ring infiltrometer method. The minimum tillage system provided better results compared with the others, with water infiltration rate of 167 mm h(-1), and the equation that best fitted the data of the ring infiltrometer was Kostiakov's, in the no-tillage system.

TI  - WEED COMPETITION WITH SOYBEAN IN NO-TILLAGE AGROFORESTRY AND SOLE-CROP SYSTEMS IN SUBTROPICAL BRAZIL
T2  - PLANTA DANINHA
M3  - Article
AB  - Weed competition on soybean (Glycine max) growth and yield was expected to be different when managed in an agroforestry system as compared with sole-cropping without trees. Therefore agronomic practices to control weeds might need to be modified in agroforestry systems. We analyzed weed competition effects on soybean growth, grain yield, and yield components at different distances from 4year- old eucalyptus (Eucalyptus benthamii) in an alley cropping system, as well as in a sole-crop system in southern Brazil. Above-ground soybean biomass was collected throughout the growing season and a logistic function was used to model crop growth. Weed above-ground biomass sampled during the soybean cycle, and grain yield and yield components at the end of the growing season were evaluated using regression analysis across positions between tree lines, and results compared to those without influence of trees. Soybean yield components were mostly reduced between tree lines compared with sole-cropping without trees. Soybean growth and yield within the eucalyptus agroforestry system was not affected by weed competition. However, weeds reduced soybean growth and yield in sole-cropping without trees. Reduction in soybean yield in the agroforestry system was rather caused by competition from trees. Therefore, tree interference may limit both weed and soybean growth potential.

TI  - Improved Crop-specific NOx Emissions from Croplands in Southeast Asia over 1980-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone and fine particulate matter. Although regulatory policies in Southeast Asia have successfully limited combustion sources of NOx emissions, fertilized cropland NOx emissions have become increasingly prominent. However, the amount and geographic distribution of NOx emissions from fertilized croplands over Southeast Asia remain largely uncertain. Here, we use a bottom-up spatial model that combines temperature dependence and the Yienger and Levy (YL95) scheme to quantify the spatiotemporal changes in crop-specific fertilized cropland NOx emissions at five-arcminute resolution (about 10 km) from 1980 to 2019. The results show a 4-fold increase in NOx emissions from fertilized croplands in Southeast Asia from 12.9 Gg N yr-1 (R 50, the difference between the 25% and 75% quantiles: 8.8-17.7 Gg N yr-1) in 1980 to 53.3 Gg N yr-1 (R 50: 35.6-72.0 Gg N yr-1) in 2019. During 1980-2019, the annual NOx emissions of rice, maize and other crops showed increasing spatial trends (0.20, 0.21, and 0.63 Gg N yr-2, respectively), whereas those of wheat remained flat (-0.0006 Gg N yr-2). Our new estimate averages 19% lower than previous bottom-up and top-down estimates. The NOx emissions hotspots are mainly located in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines for rice, maize and other crops and in Myanmar for wheat. Our crop-specific and spatially explicit NOx emissions inventories can contribute to identifying emissions and reduction hotspots and assessing future policy implications regarding mitigation options for improving air quality and food security in Southeast Asia. Future studies that comprehensively consider meteorological conditions, soil properties, management practices and small-scale land-use changes can potentially lower the uncertainty of this estimation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Erosion is the main cause of soil and water degradation, which demands investments for the recovery of such natural resources. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and spatialize soil losses in a municipality with large areas of monoculture of sugarcane.Design/methodology/approach - The Universal Soil Loss Equation was applied for the identification of areas susceptible to erosion in the municipality of Jahu, SP, Brazil. Soil maps, statistical census data from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, radar images from SRTM, rainfall data from Fatec-Jahu hydrometeorological station and digital satellite images from Landsat 5 TM were used for the analyses. Four basic parameters were evaluated: topography of the terrain, rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and soil use and management factors. The analyses were conducted in the Geographic Information System (ArcView software).Findings - The results show most of the municipality (91 percent) consists of areas of erosion potential. However, the remaining 9 percent can potentially produce 40 percent of the sediment load, which indicates the need for conservation practices and environmental recovery for a reduction in the erosion process acceleration.Originality/value - In view of the expansion of sugarcane culture in the cities of Sao Paulo, the results show the importance of a master plan for new areas of sugarcane planting and the need for restoration of riparian vegetation in the surrounding streams and springs for the reduction of erosion.

TI  - BIOMASS YIELD AND CALORIFIC VALUE OF SIX CLONAL STANDS OF Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake CULTIVATED IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldwide demand for clean, sustainable energy has increased in recent years. A potential alternative energy source is biomass from nonnative forests, particularly from the genus Eucalyptus spp. in the specific case of Brazil, currently with several selected clonal stands for energy production. Because each stand adapts differently to different environments, specific studies are required in order to evaluate energy production in a given region. The objective of this study is to determine, from among six clonal stands of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake, which have greater potential for production of biomass and energy in the South Central region of Maranhao (Grajau.). Clonal stands planted at a spacing of 4 x 3 m apart were evaluated at age 41 months, distributed in a completely randomized design with five replicates. Each experimental plot consisted of 100 trees. Analysis included determining biomass yield and distribution in each tree portion as well as calorific value of bark and wood components. Out of the six clonal stands, two outdid the others both in biomass yield and in energy generation, surpassing the least yielding stand by up to 27%.

AB  - Forest conversion to agricultural land in the upstream area of Merawu watershed has changes the ecosystem composition and reduced the stability. Mass erosion and landslide occurred in the upstream and increased the ecosystem vulnerability. Tamansari and Penanggungan hamlets are prone to erosion, landslides and environmental pollution from intensive farming. Potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and chili are the main commodities planted, particularly in Penanggungan hamlet. Planting on the steep slope, intensive land mechanization and high intensity of pesticide spraying caused the area to be prone to ecosystem disasters such as erosion, landslides and environmental pollution. This study aims to determine the people's perceptions of ecosystem disasters and analyse the community adaptation and mitigation strategies. Community perceptions is analysed using Mann Whitney test, while adaptation and mitigation strategies using qualitative descriptive. The results showed that the upper Merawu watershed community's perceptions varied greatly by knowledge and attitudes of the community. Knowledge is affected by the intervention of PT. Indonesia Power and Field Extension Officer. Community attitudes are influenced by the type of land use and commodities planted. Adaptation actions practiced by the community include water drainage cleaning, application of intercropping, crop rotation and agroforestry. Mitigation actions carried out by the community include the construction of drainage channels, terraces, embankments, and planting of wood plants (structural mitigation) while mitigation carried out by the government is more towards non-structural mitigation such as socialization and training, planting joint seedlings and the establishment of disaster resilient village (i.e., Destanta).

TI  - Effects of landscape configuration and composition on phylogenetic diversity of trees in a highly fragmented tropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Fragmentation of tropical forests is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A key question is understanding how fragmentation impacts phylogenetic diversity, which summarizes the total evolutionary history shared across species within a community. Conserving phylogenetic diversity decreases the potential of losing unique ecological and phenotypic traits and plays important roles in maintaining ecosystem function and stability.2. Our study was conducted in landscapes within the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled living trees with d.b.h. >= 4.8 cm in 0.1 ha plots within 28 fragment interiors and 12 fragment edges to evaluate the impacts of landscape configuration, composition and patch size, as well as edge effects, on phylogenetic diversity indices (PD, a measure of phylogenetic richness; MPD, phylogenetic distance between individuals in a community in deep evolutionary time; and MNTD, phylogenetic distance between each individual and its nearest phylogenetic neighbour).3. We found that PD and MPD were correlated with species richness, while MNTD was not. Best models suggest that MPD was positively related to edge density and negatively related to the number of forest patches, but that there was no effect of landscape configuration and composition metrics on PD or MNTD, or on standardized values of phylogenetic structure (sesPD, sesMPD and sesMNTD), which control for species richness. Considering all selected models for phylogenetic diversity and structure, edge density and number of forest patches were most frequently selected.4. With increasing patch size, we found lower PD in interiors but no change at edges and lower sesMNTD regardless of habitat type. Additionally, PD and sesMNTD were higher in interiors than at edges.5. Synthesis. Changes in MPD and sesMNTD suggest that extirpation of species at edges or in highly fragmented landscapes increases the dominance of species within a subset of clades (phylogenetic clustering), likely those adapted to disturbance. Smaller patch sizes are phylogenetically diverse and overdispersed, probably due to an invasion of edge-adapted species. Conservation must enhance patch area and connectivity via forest restoration; pivotally, even small forest patches are important reservoirs of phylogenetic diversity in the highly threatened Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - Predicting soil C changes after pasture intensification and diversification in Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, poorly managed pasture can contribute to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Brazil, sustainable management systems are being proposed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and increase the soil C stock under degraded pasture. However, despite the potential benefits in the adoption of sustainable management systems, few studies have been carried out seeking to analyze their long-term effects on the soil C cycle. In this study, we used the DayCent model to simulate the effects of converting poorly managed pastures (PMP) to more-intensive and diversified systems of pasture management [fertilized pasture (FP), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and integrated livestock-forest (ILF)] on long-term soil C stocks and microbial biomass C (MBC). We also evaluated the effects of different pasture management scenarios for FP (fertilization frequency), ICL (time of implementation of the crop phase) and IFL (spacing between the tree rows). The DayCent model estimated that the conversion of PMP to FP, ICL and ILF increases the soil C stocks by 0.95, 0.04-0.70 and 0.16 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Similarly, the MBC contents also increased with conversion, mainly for ICL and ILF. In addition, the fertilization of the pasture every year (FP), the implementation of the crop phase within two years (ICL) and the spacing between the tree rows of 15 m (ILF) showed the highest soil C stocks and MBC contents. FP, ICL and IFL were also GHG sinks of 43, 57 and 116 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1), respectively. These results can help national initiatives associated with the recovery of degraded pasture in Brazil.

TI  - Evidence of limited carbon sequestration in soils under no-tillage systems in the Cerrado of Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian government aims at augmenting the area cropped under no-tillage (NT) from 32 to 40 million ha by 2020 as a means to mitigate CO2 emissions. We estimated soil carbon (C) sequestration under continuous NT systems in two municipalities in the Goias state that are representative of the Cerrado. A chronosequence of NT fields of different age since conversion from conventional tillage (CT) was sampled in 2003 and 2011. Soil C levels of native Cerrado and pasture were measured for comparison. After about 11 to 14 years, soil C stocks under NT were highest and at the levels of those under natural Cerrado. Average annual rates of soil C sequestration estimated using the chronosequence approach were respectively 1.61 and 1.48 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the 2003 and 2011 sampling, and were higher than those observed using repeated sampling after eight years. The diachronic sampling revealed that the younger NT fields tended to show higher increases in soil C stocks than the older fields. Converting an extra 8 million ha of cropland from CT to NT represents an estimated soil C storage of about 8 Tg C yr(-1) during 10 to 15 years.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating soil sealing process of the semi-arid region of Brazil is important to describe this process and mitigate its effects. The objective of this work was to evaluate surface sealing and physical properties of the main soils of the Upper Ipanema watershed, in Pesqueira, Pernambuco state, Brazil, with the use of mulch. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications, using a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial arrangement consisted of three soil classes (abruptic Eutrophic Yellow Argissolo - AEYA, typical Eutrophic Fluvic Neossolo - TEFN, and typical Eutrophic Yellow Argissolo - TEYA), three application times of simulated rainfalls (at 0, 24, and 48 h), and two mulching conditions (with and without mulch), totaling 54 tests. Soil erosion rates, surface sealing, and resistance to penetration were evaluated. The use of mulch decreased significantly the soil water losses by 71.9% (AEYA), 62.9% (TEFN), and 41.1% (TEYA) after the first rainfall application (0 h) when compared to treatments without mulch, and promoted a higher water infiltration rate. The lowest soil resistance to penetration were found in soils with mulch. The AEYA and TEFN presented changes in porosity and migration of fine particles in the treatment without mulch. The TENF was the only soil that presented an incipient soil surface sealing layer in the treatment without mulch.

TI  - Evaluation of photosynthetic variables of Brachiaria brizantha under eucalyptus canopies in a livestock-forestry integration system
T2  - Agronomy Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock sector generates significant environmental impacts despite its global economic importance. The current challenge is to find sustainable ways of boosting this sector, while mitigating the negative impacts of this activity. In Brazil, degraded pastures are common because of inadequate management, damaging the soil. Integrated livestock-forestry (ILF) systems combine forest species and pastures in the area, incorporating elements of sustainability. In this system, the tree species is related to the productivity of the pasture, as the shade generated by the canopy creates different light conditions, influencing the photosynthetic activity of the forage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the luminosity of the understory of an ILF system on the photosynthetic activity of the forage species Brachiaria brizantha in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. Transient chlorophyll a fluorescence and chlorophyll concentration were analysed in forage plants grown in consortium with Eucalyptus urograndis (Clone 1407), with spacing of 4m between trees and 24m between tree rows. Two treatments were established based on light conditions: the control treatment, corresponding to the condition with the highest light corresponded to the pasture row, and the treatment with the lowest light, corresponding to the area under the canopy. The results show that the low light supplied to the forage plant, during the experiment period, under eucalyptus canopies, promotes changes in the intensity of chlorophyll a fluorescence and chlorophyll concentration, indicating low efficiency of the electron transport chain and changes in leaf nitrogen content, due to a possible stress situation.

T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH

CP  - Workshop on Soil Structural Quality of Tropical Soils - Visual Evaluation Methods and Soil Compaction Prevention Strategies
CL  - Maringa, BRAZIL
AB  - In France, agronomists have studied the effects of cropping systems on soil structure using a field method that is based on a visual description of the soil structure. This "profil cultural" method was designed as a field diagnostic tool to identify the effects of tillage and compaction on soil structure dynamics. It is of great benefit to agronomists seeking to improve crop management and preserve soil structure and fertility.However, the "profil cultural" method was developed and has mainly been used in conventional tillage systems with regular ploughing. As there has been an increase in the use of various forms of reduced, minimum and no-tillage systems in many parts of the world, it is necessary to re-evaluate this method's ability to describe and interpret soil structure dynamics in no-till or reduced tillage. In these situations, changes in soil structure over time are mainly driven by compaction and by regeneration through natural agents (climatic conditions, root growth and macrofauna), therefore it is important to evaluate the effects of these natural processes on soil structure dynamics.These concerns have led to adaptations and amendments to the initial method based on field observations and experimental work in different cropping systems, soil types and climatic conditions. The description of crack types has been improved and a criterion of biological activity based on the visual examination of clods has been introduced.To test this modified method, a comparison with the initial method was undertaken and its ability to make diagnoses tested in five experiments in France, Brazil and Argentina. The adapted method allowed an improved assessment of the impact of cropping systems on soil functioning when natural processes were integrated into the description. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from soil under integrated farming systems in southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from integrated farming systems. Soil N2O and CH4 fluxes were assessed in a subtropical Cambisol in southern Brazil, using manual static chambers, over two years, in five farming systems (cropland, livestock, integrated crop-livestock, integrated livestock-forestry, and integrated crop-livestock-forestry). The study was conducted in four growing seasons: summer-1, winter-1, summer-2, winter-2. Integrated farming systems had lower soil N2O emissions than livestock. The observed reduction was possibly due to lower water-filled pore space (WFPS) in soils under integrated systems (average 59.5-64.7%, vs 70.4% in livestock) as indicated by correlation (r = 0.74). Cropland, including cover-crops and maize, also had lower N2O emission (by 40%) relative to livestock, of levels similar to those observed in integrated systems. Methane was consumed in soil, but it was not affected by farming systems, and offset only similar to 1.4% of the N2O emissions. In the rainiest season of summer-2, the soil had the highest WFPS (on average 71.4%) and thus the highest N2O emission (on average 9.79 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1)) and the lowest CH4 consumption (on average - 0.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)); while the opposite trend occurred in the driest season of winter-2 (on average 57.3% WFPS; 0.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1) and -0.90 kg CH4-C ha(-1) season(-1)). Integrated farming systems including crop-livestock, livestock-forestry and crop-livestock-forestry reduced soil N2O emissions relative to sole livestock by 27-40%, but did not affect CH4 emissions. Seasonal variations of precipitation, and therefore WFPS were driving factors of the N2O and CH4 emissions. Overall, integrated farming systems show the potential to mitigate soil N2O emission compared to livestock system.

TI  - Assessing the Sustainability of NTFP-Based Community Enterprises: A Viable Business Model for Indonesian Rural Forested Areas
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's vast forested areas have the potential to serve as a crucial source of livelihood for local communities. However, the current contributions of these forests to community livelihoods are significantly underutilized in comparison to their potential. This study evaluates the financial performance and sustainability of community forest-based businesses operating around the forest management area of the Lakitan-Bukit Cogong forest management unit (LBC FMU). Data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with the key informants through purposive sampling. Financial viability analysis and a qualitative approach were used to assess the feasibility of the businesses. The findings revealed that all businesses show positive values for all financial indicators. From profit estimation and value-added distribution, all products are shown to be feasible. Concerning the value and supply chain, the rubber-processing industry has a remarkable flow. Moreover, small forest enterprises (SFEs) highlight natural capital optimization through multitudinous derivatives of products that could support a substantial regenerative economy, including citronella essential oil, native honeybees, rubber-based product, biochar, skewers, and liquid smoke. In addition, the multidimensional scaling and rapid appraisal for forest (MDS-RAPForest) approach generates a result based on multiple dimensions (ecology, economics, social and human resources, and institutional and administrative dimensions) showing that overall, SFEs are categorized as sufficient/quite sustainable. Furthermore, mainstreaming adaptable forest-based enterprises, jurisdiction approaches, and cross-production system strategies are also discussed. Our findings suggest that sustainable NTFP-based activities within a community context can be facilitated through interconnected market systems, appropriate price regulations, and support from stakeholders and legal frameworks.

TI  - N2O emissions from soils under different uses in the Brazilian Cerrado-A review
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Review
AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) is a biome of great socio-economic and environmental importance to Brazil. The rapid agricultural expansion in the Cerrado biome areas promoted biogeochemical cycles that affect nitrogen and carbon dynamics, leading to increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Brazil, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the main gas in agriculture, and agricultural practices increase emissions into the atmosphere. This review aimed to assess the influence of agriculture on N2O emissions in the Cerrado region, based on existing data in the literature, and extract patterns of direct N2O emissions in different agricultural systems in the Cerrado from existing data. A systematic review of data from 36 scientific publications in the Cerrado region with several crop systems revealed that N2O emissions varied from 0.15 kg ha(-1) in native cerrado to 4.84 kg ha(-1) in conventional tillage. Agricultural systems, nitrogen fertilizer application, and crop residues influence N2O emissions. One of the strategies to mitigate emissions is the sustainable intensification of farming systems. Cumulative N2O emissions in the Cerrado range from 0.001 to 4.84 kg ha(-1) in different land-use scenarios. Soil under the conventional tillage system (CT) had the highest emissions, with an overall average of 1.58 kg ha(-1) of N2O, compared to no-till system (NT) (0.82 kg ha(-1)) and native Cerrado 0.15 kg ha(-1). Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems in the Cerrado had emissions with an overall average of 1.68 kg ha(-1), integrated crop-livestock-forest systems (ICLF) had 1.20 ha(-1), and eucalyptus plantations had 0.48 kg ha(-1).

TI  - Mitigation of soil compaction for boosting crop productivity at varying yield environments in southern Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil compaction is one of the most relevant crop yield-limiting factors in no-till (NT) farming systems in southern Brazil. This study aimed to identify strategies to mitigate soil compaction and increase crop productivity at low, medium and high yield environments within a field. Treatments evaluated were: control (without intervention), PG (phosphogypsum), MC (mechanical chiselling), PCC (polyculture of cover crops), MC + PG, PCC + PG, MC + PCC and MC + PCC + PG. Soil physical and chemical attributes (soil macroporosity, bulk density, penetration resistance) and soybean yield (Glycine max L.) and black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) biomass production were evaluated. In the low and medium yield environments, MC + PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yields: 5,455 kg ha(-1) and 5,534 kg ha(-1), respectively. In the high yield environment, PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yield (5,579 kg ha(-1)), whereas MC decreased yields relative to the control. Black oat biomass production responded to the treatments similarly to soybean yields. Overall, integrating two or three decompaction strategies improved soil physical attributes in a greater proportion relative to single strategies and to the control, enhancing both soybean and black oat performances. Selection of the right decompaction strategies for each yield environment might help increase productivity under NT and optimize the use of time, labour, fuel and other resources. HighlightsSoil compaction limits crop yields under no-tillage farming in southern Brazil. Low, medium and high yield environments were delineated with precision agriculture tools. Single or integrated mechanical, chemical and biological soil decompaction strategies were tested. Soil decompaction strategies to increase soybean yields are specific to yield environments.

TI  - Quantifying market prevalence, abundance, and suitable habitats of bulbuls in Java, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of bulbuls in the Indonesian cage bird trade raises concerns about its impact on their distributions and, consequently, the ecological balance. This study delves into the trade dynamics of bulbuls, examining their market prevalence and its correlation with their abundance in the wild and their suitable habitats. We conducted bird market surveys across Java, supplemented by online trade surveys to ascertain market prevalence. Concurrently, we collected bulbul's presence data from three databases and field surveys from 2018 to 2023. We used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the suitable habitats for bulbuls. The findings revealed that 20 bulbul species, comprising 11 native and 9 non-native to Java, were encountered in 20 bird markets, totalling 35,715 individuals. Sooty-headed (Pycnonotus aurigaster) and yellow-vented (P. goiavier) bulbuls, both Least Concern, dominated the field-RAI (Relative Abundance Index) and trade-RAI. Notably, rare species such as the strawheaded bulbul (P. zeylanicus, Critically Endangered) and extirpated from Java, were present in markets. We found no relationship between the field-RAI and the trade-RAI, suggesting that all species were sought after regardless of their abundance. However, we found that threatened species face over-harvesting based on the ratio between trade-RAI and field-RAI. A significant portion of predicted suitable habitats for resident species fell outside bird-friendly areas. Urgent intervention measures, targeting small-scale agroforestry landowners and key sites for population protection, are imperative to mitigate the potential ecological consequences of the bulbul trade and ensure their continued contribution to tropical ecosystem health.

TI  - Artificial neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for prediction of soil respiration in forested areas southern Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the temporal variability of CO2 emission (FCO2) from O-2 influx into the soil (FO2) in a reforested area with native vegetation in the Brazilian Cerrado, as well as to understand the dynamics of soil respiration in this ecosystem. The database is composed of soil respiration data, agroclimatic variables, improved vegetation index (EVI), and soil attributes used to train machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The predictive performance was evaluated based on the mean absolute error (MEA), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), agreement index (d), confidence coefficient (c), and coefficient of determination (R2). The best estimation results for validation were FCO2 with multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.967 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and radial basis function neural network (RBF) (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.884 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and FO2 with MLP (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.093 mg m(-2) s(-1)) and RBF (R-2 = 0.74, 0.079 mg m(-2) s(-1)). Soil temperature and macroporosity are important predictors of FCO2 and FO2. The best combination of variables for training the ANFIS was selected based on trial and error. The results were as follows: FCO2 (R-2 = 16) and FO2 (R-2 = 29). In all models, FCO2 outperformed FO2. A primary factor analysis was performed, and FCO2 and FO2 correlated best with the weather and soil attributes, respectively.

TI  - Our Hungry Neighbor: Self-Reported Data from Farmers' Perspective on Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Forest, Indonesia.
T2  - Tropical Conservation Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research AimsHuman-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers' awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans.MethodsWe used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.ResultsWe found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses.ConclusionThe study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives.Implications for ConservationThe study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers' perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region.

TI  - Survival and development of fall armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in weeds during the off-season
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistence and high dispersal of weeds during the off-season can favor the survival of pests and diseases that threaten cultivated crops in Brazil. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is one of the principal polyphagous pests that takes advantage of the no-tillage system. Despite its pest status, little is known about S. frugiperda survival and development in alternative hosts, including those resistant to glyphosate. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the adaptive capacity of S. frugiperda in volunteer maize and 6 weeds commonly found in Brazilian agroecosystems, including species with biotypes known for glyphosate resistance, such as fleabane, sourgrass, and goosegrass. We found that S. frugiperda survival and biomass were significantly higher in goosegrass, maize, and johnsongrass in both laboratory and greenhouse conditions. In contrast, fleabane, benghal dayflower, sourgrass, and smooth pigweed caused a decrease in S. frugiperda fitness. Along with S. frugiperda adaptive capacity, our results suggest that its persistence in the field can be directly related to weed control inefficiency during the off-season, increasing the demand for integrated pest and weed management.

TI  - IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT AND BIODEGRADABLE MULCHING IMPACT ON CARROT BIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS AND YIELD
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the biometric and productive characteristics of carrot (Daucus carota L.) under different irrigation levels and soil covers. Experiments were carried out at the Federal University of Vicosa in 2019 and 2020, to evaluate the effect of five irrigation levels (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of the daily irrigation depth) and soil coverings (control, plastic mulching, and paper mulching), on the variables soil moisture (U), actual water consumption (AWC), root length (R) and diameter (D), leaf height (H) and temperature (T), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), yield (Y) and dry root biomass (DB). Irrigation management was performed with tensiometers. There was no significant interaction (P < 0.05) between the factors. Irrigation significantly influenced D, H, T, NDVI, Y, and DB, while the soil cover treatment affected R, D, H, NDVI, Y, and DB. The highest yields were found in 100% irrigation (34.89 t ha(-1)) and with paper mulching (30.55 t ha(-1)). The results can guide future adaptations to the carrot production system currently in force in Brazil. As for biometric characteristics, yield, and sustainability in the use of water for irrigation were studied.

TI  - Herbicide resistance status of sourgrass
T2  - ADVANCES IN WEED SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sourgrass [Digitaria insularis (L.) Mez ex Ekman] is one of the most challenging herbicide-resistant weeds in the grain-producing areas of Southeast, Central-west, and Northeast of Brazil. This species is a perennial grass that is highly competitive with the C4 photosynthetic pathway. It easily adapts to different environments and reproduces through both seed and rhizomes. The objective of this review was to compile what is known about sourgrass biology, the state of herbicide resistance and its associated mechanisms, and main weed management strategies. The high seed viability, ease of dispersal and the strong propensity to develop resistance to herbicides like glyphosate and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors in the prevalent no-tillage system in Brazil make the sourgrass one of the most difficult weeds to control. Due to the great genetic variability, the resistance mechanisms conferring glyphosate-resistance among sourgrass populations range from reduced absorption, altered translocation, enhanced metabolism, target-site mutations, and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) overexpression. In addition, Trp2027Cys mutation was found to confer cross-resistance to ACCase inhibitors. Sourgrass management strategies include herbicide rotation, herbicide tank mix or sequential applications, as well as the use of mulch to reduce infestations. These measures must be implemented before crop sowing because the range of management options is greater than in after crop sowing. Additionally, the best control of sourgrass is achieved when management is carried out during the early growth stages, before the plants develop rhizomes and form clumps.

TI  - Abundance of Meiofauna and Physical-Chemical Parameters as Water Quality Indicator.
T2  - Ilmu Kelautan
M3  - Article
AB  - The zone of Losari Coast is an icon of Makassar city, however increase activity of surrounding communities causes a decrease in the water quality. Meiofauna is an effective benthic organism used as an indicator of water quality. This study assessed the meiofauna abundance and physical-chemical parameters as water quality indicator in the Losari Coast, Makassar. The sampling method in this study was purposive sampling. The resuts showed that total meiofauna abundance identified was 66791 indv.m2, composed of 12 phylum and 91 species or genera. Stations at the estuary of the Jeneberang and Tallo River are two sites with high level of abundance, this condition allows presence of organic contaminants triggers the high growth of meiofauna in these locations. Dissolved Oxygen is below its supposed level in waters. Acidity, phosphate and nitrate content at some of research stations exceed the threshold of their allowed presence in waters set by Indonesia government. Ostracoda, Oligochaeta, Polychaeta, tunicata and Ciliophora are phylums with a high level of abundance, because the phylum has high adaptability to pollutant. Good water quality is indicated by a variety of biota living in the waters, the range of diversity and uniformity indices shows that meiofauna species are categorized highly diverse and evenly distributed. The dominance index shows that there is no species was dominant, except stations around Losari reclamation project. Temperature, current velocity, depth, brightness, salinity, pH, DO, nitrateseawater, and phosphate-seawater correlate with meiofauna abundance. The results as a consideration for the management or monitoring of coastal environments.

TI  - Can Joint Carbon and Biodiversity Management in Tropical Agroforestry Landscapes Be Optimized?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a potential 'win-win' scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We measured above-and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha(-1) to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha(-1) showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels.

TI  - The clove tree of Madagascar : a success story with an unpredictable future
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The clove tree was introduced to Madagascar from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia at the beginning of the 19th century. In spite of its sensitivity to hazards such as cyclones, a locally found pest known as andretra and year-on-year variability in the production of cloves, it has adapted surprisingly well to the ecological conditions on Madagascar's East coast, particularly the Analanjirofo Region. The species was adopted very rapidly by farmers.(some settlers but mostly native peasant farmers), who integrated it into their cropping systems as a complement to their staple crops (rice, in particular) and cash crops (coffee and vanilla). Currently, the marketability of cloves brings a regular income to households, ensuring them food security. The clove tree bears two products of high economic value, the clove, which is the dried flower bud, and the essential oil, derived from distillation of the leaves, of which Madagascar is the world's number one exporter. Products from the clove tree, along with vanilla, account for the largest (second largest in some years) proportion of Madagascar's agricultural exports. Cloves are exported primarily to Indonesia to be used in the production of the local cigarettes known as kretek. There is a small demand from northern countries for exports of the clove spice. Clove essential oil is produced in a plethora of redimentary stills located throughout the clove growing zone. The quality of the essential oil depends on the content of eugenol, a molecule of interest in a number of commercial sectors including the cosmetic industry, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and the food industry. The clove tree in Madagascar seems to represent an example of successful adoption and integration of a new crop into existing production systems. However, the clove tree plantations are ageing and the conditions for their renewal are not fully established. Whilst the market for cloves is largely dependent on demand from Indonesia, the future looks promising for the world market in clove spices and eugenol-based products. Consequently, current practices and possible ways of adapting and developing the Malagasy clove sector in new directions need to be investigated and addressed in order to balance the future demands of the markets with the needs of the farmers in terms of resource management and valorization.

TI  - Deep soil tillage in the coffee planting furrow has long-lasting benefits for improving soil physical quality and enhancing plant vigor in dense soils
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep furrows and additional liming can improve soil quality and reduce drought impact during coffee plant establishment, especially in dense soils. However, the effects of the initial preparer in the medium to long term are scarce. This study aims to assess the five-year impact of different deep tillage strategies and chemical fertility improvement of the planting furrow on soil physical quality and plant growth under Cambisol with coffee cultivation. The experiment was conducted in a Cambisol in Nazareno, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The experiment followed a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement in space, including three blocks, six soil depths (0-0.05, 0.15-0.20, 0.35-0.40, 0.55-0.60, 0.60-0.70, and 0.75-0.80 m), and five soil preparation methods: SP40, furrower at 0.40 m with conventional fertilization; SP60, rotary hoe at 0.60 m with additional liming (SP60AL); SP80, soil homogenizer at 0.60 m and subsoiler at 0.80 m with additional liming (SP80AL). These soil preparations were compared with a native savannah vegetation area from the Cerrado biome (Natural). Undisturbed samples were collected at different depths five years after the initial soil preparation. In these samples, physical quality indicators were investigated along with the correlation of plant measurements (stem diameter - SD, plant height - PH, and normalized difference vegetation index - NDVI). Analysis of variance and the Scott-Knott and Dunnett tests (p <0.05) were applied to analyze the data. After five years of soil preparation, improvements up to 0.40 m depth were due to soil homogenization, subsoiling, and liming, reducing bulk density and enhancing water retention. Additional limestone between 0.20 and 0.60 m depth improved SD, PH, and NDVI, mitigating drought. However, initial soil preparation induced compaction at 0.60-0.70 m depth, with subsoiler effects disappearing at 0.80 m. Effective deep tillage improves soil quality but requires careful planning.

TI  - C-offset and crop energy efficiency increase due industrial poultry waste use in long-term no-till soil minimizing environmental pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the major global poultry producers, and the organic waste generated by the chicken slaughterhouses can potentially be used as a biofertilizer in agriculture. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous use of biofertilizer to the crops, substituting the use of mineral fertilizer promote C-offset for the soil and generate crop energy efficiency for the production system. Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of biofertilizer use alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation, C-offset, crop energy efficiency and productivity, and alleviation of environmental pollution. The experiment was established in southern Brazil on a soil under 15 years of continuous no-till (NT). Experimental treatments were as follows: i) Control with no fertilizer application, ii) 100% use of industrial mineral fertilizer (Min-F); iii) 100% use of organic waste originated from poultry slaughterhouses and hereinafter designated biofertilizer (Bio-F), and iv) Mixed fertilizer equivalent to the use of 50% mineral fertilizer + 50% of biofertilizer (Mix-F). Effects of experimental treatments were assessed for the crop sequence based on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays) in the summer and wheat (Triticum aestivum) and black oat (Avena strigosaSchreb) in the winter composing two crops per year, as follow: bean/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-bean. The continuous use of Bio-F treatment significantly increased the index of crop energy efficiency. It was higher than that of control, and increased it by 25.4 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) over that of Min-F treatment because of higher inputs of crop biomass-C into the system. Further, continuous use of Bio-F resulted in a significantly higher CO(2)eq stock and offset than those for Min-F treatment. A positive relationship between the C-offset and the crop energy efficiency (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.001) indicated that the increase of C-offset was associated with the increase of energy balance and the amount of SOC sequestered. The higher energy efficiency and C-offset by application of Bio-F indicated that the practice of crop bio fertilization with poultry slaughterhouse waste is a viable alternative for recycling and minimizing the environmental impacts.

TI  - Livestock intensification and environmental sustainability: An analysis based on pasture management scenarios in the brazilian savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's major beef production occurs in the Cerrado, predominantly as extensive pastures that covers similar to 50 Mha of the biome, of which approximately 2/3 show signs of degradation. Pasture recovery is now a key environmental policy, as it improves land use efficiency and soil carbon sequestration. However, as intensification leads to higher cattle stocking rates and external inputs (fertilizers, liming, etc.), the impact of improved pastures on greenhouse gas mitigation is still debatable. This study focused on the Cerrado biome and aimed to (i) quantify soil carbon stock changes under different scenarios of management and recovery of degraded pastures. In addition, (ii) the potential for capturing carbon in the soil to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by the intensification of pastures was evaluated. Soil C stock changes (0-20 cm) were assessed using the Century model version 4.5, which had been previously validated for the region. Model parameters were adjusted for three pastures classes (degraded, intermediately degraded, and not degraded) within a time-series (1985-2020) of land use maps for the Cerrado, serving as baselines. Scenarios of pasture intensification were modeled against these baselines, and an analysis was carried out on the estimated changes in soil C stock and greenhouse gas balance. Before the intensification scenario (year 2020), the total carbon stock was estimated to be similar to 1830 Mt for the whole pasture area, whose spatial distribution corresponded to edaphoclimatic contrasts and pasture conditions. The highest soil organic carbon stocks were observed in the non-degraded pastures. With the increase in carrying capacity, beef production is estimated to potentially increase by 1/3 due to the recovery of degraded areas through intensive management. This increase would be sufficient to meet the projected similar to 12% increase in Brazil's livestock production by the end of the decade if all pasture areas are restored, which is much possibly an unrealistic scenario as not all degraded areas are suitable for crops or can successfully improve pasture yield. In addition, the increase in soil C stocks was only sufficient to compensate for 27% and 42% of the GHG emissions resulting from intensification in areas with intermediate and severe degradation, respectively. Therefore, to strike a balance between economic considerations and environmental impact, additional strategies are needed to reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance C sinks, such as increasing tree density on farms. From this perspective, implementing livestock intensification at the landscape scale can promote C stocks and the diversity of ecosystem services, opening the possibility of ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Managing runoff in rainfed agriculture under no-till system: potential for improving crop production
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategies to mitigate degradation and ensure food and water security are among the main challenges in agricultural development. Unconsolidated information about the positive impact of conservationist practices on productivity increase is fundamental for their adoption by farmers. This study evaluated if the saved rainfall excess in catchment with terrace generates higher soybean and corn yield due to greater water availability in the crop rooting zone. Experiments were conducted in southern Brazil during the agricultural years of 2016/17 (soybean) and 2017/18 (corn) in two paired zero-order catchments (similar to 2.4 ha) with similar topography and soil properties. One catchment has no terraces, while the other has five broad-based terraces as a complementary practice to control runoff. Soybean and corn yield was compared between catchments through five paired transects, totaling 47 sampling points. The fraction of available water (FAW - the current in relation to the total available water) was monitored at two points in each catchment, one at the base and the other at the top, considering the elevation. The FAW was monitored with CS616 probes at eight soil layers (from 0.00 up to 1.60 m) at each point during the crop growth cycle. The FAW was higher in the terraced catchment than the non-terraced catchment during the soybean (14 %) and corn (8 %) cycles. The terraced area provided higher soybean (12 %) and corn (10 %) than the non-terraced area. These results highlight the importance of terraces to increase productivity by managing runoff on hillslopes, indicating the potential of terraces to mitigate water deficits.

TI  - Daycent Simulation of Methane Emissions, Grain Yield, and Soil Organic Carbon in a Subtropical Paddy Rice System
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The DayCent ecosystem model, widely tested in upland agroecosystems, was recently updated to simulate waterlogged soils. We evaluated the new version in a paddy rice experiment in Southern Brazil. DayCent was used to simulate rice yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil CH4 fluxes. Model calibration was conducted with a multiple-year dataset from the conventional tillage treatment, followed by a validation phase with data from the no-tillage treatment. Model performance was assessed with statistics commonly used in modeling studies: root mean square error (RMSE), model efficiency (EF), and mean difference (M). In general, DayCent slightly underestimated rice yields under no-tillage (by 0.07 Mg ha(-1), or 9.2 %) and slightly overestimated soil C stocks, especially in the first years of the experiment. A comparison of observed and simulated CH4 daily fluxes showed that DayCent could simulate the general patterns of soil CH4 fluxes with slight discrepancies. Daily soil CH4 fluxes were overestimated by 0.43 kg ha(-1) day(-1) (12 %). Growth-season CH4 emissions under no-tillage were also somewhat overestimated (11 % or 45.29 kg ha(-1)). We conclude that DayCent simulated SOC, rice yield, and CH4 with some inaccuracies, but the overall performance was considered adequate. However, the model failed to represent the observed potential of no-tillage to mitigate CH4 emissions, possibly because model algorithms could not capture the actual field conditions derived from no-tillage management, such as soil redox potential, plant senescence, and surface placement of plant residue.

TI  - Morphological responses and tolerance of a tree native to the Brazilian Cerrado Astronium fraxinifolium Schott to boron toxicity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The indiscriminate use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides can lead to boron contamination of the soil. Decontamination in general is expensive and results in other impacts. Phytoremediation is a sustainable alternative for soil restoration. Astronium fraxinifolium Schott (Anacardiaceae) is a tree species native to the Cerrado that is considered to be a pioneer species and a selective xerophyte, and it has been widely used in the reforestation and restoration of degraded areas. This study set out to characterize the physiology and anatomy of A. fraxinifolium under different boron concentrations and to assess the tolerance and phytoremediation potential of the species. An experiment with a completely randomized design was conducted in a greenhouse. The carbon allocation and chlorophyll content of leaves of A. fraxinifolium were determined. Boron concentration and the species' tolerance index were calculated from root and shoot samples. Levels of amino acids, proteins, total carbohydrates, starch, phenolic compounds, and anatomical analysis were also measured. A. fraxinifolium showed tolerance to boron concentrations in the substrate and accumulated a greater amount of the element in the aerial part, showing its phytoextraction ability. No significant differences were found in the physiology of A. fraxinifolium; however, some anatomical changes were observed. In the leaves, there were changes in the thickness of the abaxial surface of the epidermis and palisade and spongy parenchyma, and total leaf thickness, and in the roots, there were changes in the thickness of the phloem, diameter of vessel elements, and number of vessel elements per square millimeter. However, boron did not interfere in the development and survival of A. fraxinifolium, which points to the possibility that the species has phytoremediation potential.

AB  - Mining activity is indispensable for the current stage of progress of our civilization. Although it is a temporary activity, its impacts are remarkable, especially with respect to landscape modifications. To mitigate such impacts, the implementation of monitored environmental recovery projects is of fundamental importance. Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is a multicriteria analysis using remote sensing data and field information, suitable for monitoring the performance of recovery projects in areas degraded by the mining activity. In this work, LFA was used to evaluate the results of 20 years of environmental recovery projects in a gold mine. Ten base maps were developed: Declivity, Vegetation/Physiognomy Stratification, Fractures and faults, Compaction degree/soil structure, Erosion features, Geotechnical stability, Local hydrogeology, Degree of fragment isolation, Soils and Drainage. These were combined in order to give rise to three intermediate maps: Erosion and soil stability, Vegetation and Water. With the union of these three maps, it was possible to create the map with the final analysis of the environmental recovery performance. The technique used allowed the separation of native areas (which obtained the highest scores), recovered and self-sustaining areas (old mine dumps and waste piles) and areas still deficient in environmental recovery, with stability and erosion problems (mining sites and active mine dumps). In addition to allowing the analysis of large areas, the presentation of LFA results on maps facilitates decision-making and the dissemination and understanding of results by the different stakeholders involved.

TI  - Aggregation, carbon, nitrogen, and natural abundance of <SUP>13</SUP>C and <SUP>15</SUP>N in soils under no-tillage system fertilized with injection and surface application of pig slurry for five years
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Injection of pig slurry (PS) into soils under no-tillage system (NTS) is more efficient for improving soil chemical and physical attributes, and reducing C and N emissions, than surface applications. This study evaluated the effect of using injection and surface application of PS, compared to NPK and control treatments, on the soil aggregate, C and N contents, and isotopes C-13 and N-15. The NTS consisted of rotations of summer (maize) and winter (black oat and wheat) grasses from 2011 to 2015. The treatments were PS injected into the soil (PSI), PS applied on the soil surface (PSS), chemical fertilization (NPK), and control (CTRL). The following soil properties were evaluated in the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers: aggregate stability (geometric mean diameter - GMD; aggregate mass distribution); total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in macroaggregates (8.0-0.25 mm), microaggregates (<0.25 mm), and bulk soil (<2.0 mm); and isotopes C-13 and N-15 in macro and microaggregates. The application of PSI improved the soil physical attributes, presenting higher GMD (0-5 cm) than the PSS, NPK, and CTRL treatments. In the 5-10 cm layer, the PSI treatments were more efficient in increasing the GMD and macroaggregate mass than the NPK. PSI also was more efficient in increasing TOC and TN when compared to PSS, and generated a higher GMD, which are protectors of these elements in the soil. The natural abundance of N-15 denoted the lower soil organic matter decomposition in the PSI treatment when compared to the PSS. The natural abundance of C-13 showed less-negative values in macroaggregates than in microaggregates, denoting that the soil management practices and crops used (grasses) affected positively the abundance of C-13. After seven applications of PS in maize-oat-wheat rotation in NTS, the application of PSI was more efficient in improving the soil physical and chemical attributes than the application of PSS.

TI  - Non-biotic factors determining plasticity of the prospective oil-rich macauba palm (Acrocomia aculeata)
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although macauba palm (Acrocomia aculeata) is a palm native to neotropics with wide distribution in Brazil and has significant potential for biofuel production, little is known regarding its variability and adaptability to environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of macauba palm phenotypes to soil attributes and other environmental factors. Macauba palms from 18 locations of three geomorphological provinces from the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil, were evaluated regarding chemical, physical and morphological soil attributes and plant morphological attributes. Data were analyzed by uni- and multivariate statistics. Univariate statistical analysis showed that there is great variability of botanical components due to soil fertility, particle size distribution and drainage and to atmospheric climate conditions. Principal component analysis identified the botanical variables fruit weight and size and palm tree circumference at chest height, and the soil variables organic matter of A horizon contents of sand and clay, and exchangeable calcium, manganese, copper, potassium and phosphorus from subsurface horizons as those with the greatest contribution in distinguishing the studied environments. Redundancy analysis identified total sandinversely associated to water retentionpHdirectly influenced by exchangeable basesand micronutrients Zn and Mn from subsurface horizons, together with soil organic matter from A horizon, as those most associated to the botanical variables fruit weight and size. These associations show that soil fertility and particle size distribution are determining factors for the productive potential of macauba palm.

TI  - Fostering a Wildlife-Friendly Program for Sustainable Coffee Farming: The Case of Small-Holder Farmers in Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia's population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of similar to 400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals.

TI  - Nitrogen oxides and CO2 from an Oxisol cultivated with corn in succession to cover crops
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of two legumes (Crotalaria juncea and Mucuna pruriens), as cover crops, and of natural fallow, as a control treatment, on the emissions of NOx, N2O, and CO2 from an Oxisol cultivated with corn, under conventional and no-tillage systems, in the Cerrado region, in Central Brazil. Variations of CO2 fluxes in the soil were explained mainly by soil humidity and, in the legumes, under conventional system, by soil NH4+-N concentration. Plots with legumes under no-tillage system had higher annual emissions of CO2, NOx, and N2O than natural fallow. Results show that the use of legumes as cover crops favors the emissions of NOx-N + N2O-N and CO2-C. However, when considering the potential for mitigation of CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions from the soil, it is important to evaluate changes in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks.

TI  - Hairy vetch role to mitigate crop yield gap in different yield environments at field level
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variability of soil organic matter, plant water availability, and soil nitrogen (N) availability are drivers of crop response to mineral N fertilizer. The complex interaction of these factors is responsible for within-field corn and wheat yield variability. The hairy vetch (HV) cover crop is an economic, environmentally friendly, and efficient N source capable of conciliating crop yield and soil health. Nevertheless, the HV effects to mitigate yield gap of management zone (MZ) have not yet been documented. This study evaluated the effects of HV and mineral N fertilization, in single or combined input, on alleviating crop yield gap. The study was carried out in two croplands southern Brazil. The experimental design was a complete randomized block in a split plot having MZ (high, medium, and low yield) and N fertilizer rates. Wheat and corn N uptake and grain yield had a quadratic adjustment with N fertilizer input, but there was a significant MZ effect, where low yield zone (LYZ) was less responsive. Consequently, mineral N fertilization as a single input to mitigate the yield gap in this MZ was not efficient. On the other hand, HV increased corn N uptake and grain yield mainly in LYZ compared to MYZ and HYZ. HV fully mitigated the yield gap between MYZ and HYZ. The combined use of HV and mineral N fertilization rate adjusted according to N legume credit and MZ was an efficient strategy to boost yield, favoring soil health and environmental protection.

TI  - Microbiological Properties in Cropping Systems and Their Relationship with Water Erosion in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Many researchers have reported relationships of physical and chemical properties with water erosion; however, little is known about microbiological properties in this context. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate soil properties in relation to erosion in areas with different cropping system practices under no-tillage in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment has been carried out since 2014 in a Typic Haplustox under soybean (S) and maize (M) monoculture, maize/soybean annual rotation (MS), maize/brachiaria/soybean/brachiaria rotation (MBSB), two of those treatments with high input of fertilizer (MBSB-HI and MS-HI), and bare soil (BS). Soil losses were quantified in erosion plots. The design was completely randomized. The greater vegetation cover crop, provided by intercropping/succession with brachiaria, increased microbial biomass carbon. The lack of vegetation cover affected the basal soil respiration and metabolic quotient. Basal soil respiration proved to be inversely related to soil and water losses. Vegetation cover was a key factor regulating water erosion. Penetration resistance and aggregate stability correlated with soil and water losses. Thus, not only physical and chemical, but also biological properties are deeply affected by erosion, aiding in early monitoring of water erosion. Soil quality improvement in ecologically supported management contributes to mitigating erosion.

TI  - Landscape and farm scale management to enhance biodiversity conservation in the cocoa producing region of southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, large land areas are used for the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which is predominantly grown under the shade of native trees in an agroforestry system locally known as cabruca. As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability. The implementation of our recommendations should be accompanied by appropriate biological and socioeconomic monitoring and the findings should inform a broad program of adaptive management of the cabrucas and the wider cocoa landscape.

TI  - Does the Presence of Shade Trees and Distance to the Forest Affect Detection Rates of Terrestrial Vertebrates in Coffee Home Gardens?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Physical Quality and Water Flow Regulation under Straw Removal Management in Sugarcane Production Fields
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Removing sugarcane straw to increase bioenergy production can generate significant income to the industry. However, straw contributes to the regulation of soil functions and consequently supports the provision of ecosystem services, such as water flow regulation. Thus, straw removal may hinder the provision of these services, especially in mechanized sugarcane production systems, which have soil compaction problems due to machinery traffic. In this study, we assess a six-year experiment in Brazil with four rates of straw removal: 0 Mg ha(-1) (TR), 5 Mg ha(-1) (HR), 10 Mg ha(-1) (LR), and 15 Mg ha(-1) (NR) remaining straw. Using attributes, such as soil bulk density, porosity, water infiltration, runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water-holding capacity, as indicators of key soil functions, we calculated a soil-related ecosystem service (ES) index for water flow regulation provision. The ES index revealed that water flow regulation was low regardless of the straw management (0.56, 0.63, 0.64 and 0.60 for TR, HR, LR and NR, respectively). It can be a consequence of soil compaction caused by machinery traffic throughout the successive cycle, whose straw was unable to mitigate this issue. Thus, by the end of the sugarcane cycle (sixth ratoon), straw removal had little effect on soil physical and hydraulic indicators, and consequently had little impact on the provision of the soil-related ES associated with water flow regulation. Nevertheless, straw management should be planned to consider other functions and soil-related ES benefited by straw retention.

TI  - Potential cultivation areas of Euterpe edulis (Martius) for rainforest recovery, repopulation and acai production in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Euterpe edulis is an endangered palm species that provides the most important non-timber forest product exploited in its natural habitat, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot(1,4). From 1991 to 2017, pasturelands, agriculture, and monoculture of tree plantations were responsible for 97% of Atlantic Forest deforested areas in Brazil and Santa Catarina was one of the Brazilian states with the greatest loss of forest area(14). In the last decade, E. edulis fruits reached their highest commercial value, producing the southeastern equivalent of Amazonian ''acai'' (Euterpe oleracea)(5,7,8). As a shade-tolerant species, E. edulis adapts very well to agroforestry systems(8,10). To evaluate potential areas for cultivation of E. edulis through agroforestry systems, we developed and applied a spatial model for mapping suitable areas. To accomplish this, we analyzed multisource biophysical data and E. edulis distribution data from the Forest Inventory of Santa Catarina. We identified two areas with potential occurrence of the species, one in the domains of coastal Dense Ombrophilous Forest where the species is more common and another in the domains of inland Deciduous Seasonal Forest where its occurrence was suspected, but not proven, until 2021. Today, Deciduous Seasonal Forest is the most fragmented and impacted by agriculture. Our model, together with confirmed areas of occurrence, indicates that deciduous seasonal forest region should be prioritized for production and recovery of E. edulis through agroforestry systems.

TI  - Contribution to the knowledge of the ecology of the "cerrado" and "caatinga". Comparative study of the water-economy of their vegetation
T2  - UNIV SAO PAULO FAC FILOS CIENC E LETRAS BOL BOT
M3  - Article
AB  -  The present study was performed largely in the "campo cerrado" of Emas, near Pirassununga, Sao Paulo, and in the "caatinga" of Paulo Afonso, Bahia. Both habitats are characterized in detail, as to temperature, relative humidity, evaporation, precipitations, soil conditions, especially its water reserves, and lists of their vegetation are given. Transpiration rates and the velocity of stomatal reactions were established by the method of rapid weighings with a Jung's torsion-balance. Stomatal openings were also analyzed by Molisch's infiltration method with xylol and sometimes by direct observations under a microscope with vertical illumination. Curves comparing the daily march of transpiration with evaporation were established for several plants of the "cerrado", in the beginning and in the end of the dry season (1943). Three principal kinds of behavior were found (1) plants without any restriction of water expenditure at any time during the dry season: Andira humilis, Kielmeyera coriacea, Erythroxylum suberosum and Echinolaena inflexa: (2) plants without restriction at the beginning but with a small restriction at the end of the dry season; Brysonima coccolobifolia, Butia leispatha, Didymopanax vinosum and Ouratea spectabilis: (3) plants with a small restriction at the beginning of the dry season: Anona coriacea. The first type was by far the most frequent; the second appeared with small frequency, and the third was extremely rare. Observations in the "caatinga" were made during four different periods: April 1952, Jan., July and Oct.-Nov. 1953 April and July represent two periods of greater humidity in the region, and Oct.-Nov. and Jan. are very dry. The plants that were under constant experimentation were: Spondias tuberosa, Maytenus rigida, Caesalpinia pyramidatis, Jatropha phyllacantha, Astronium urundeuva, Bumelia sartorum, Aspidosperma pyrifolium and Zizyphus joazeiro Necessity of a great restriction of water consumption for all plants even during the rainy season was indicated. The "caatinga" has much more arid conditions than the "cerrado." The behavior of the plants indicates a good adaptation of the native species of the "caatinga" to the arid conditions; in the "cerrado" the unrestricted water-expenditure is explained by the presence of great amounts of available water. However, the "cerrado" plants are in general much more xeromorphic than the ?caatinga" plants, with the exception only of the cacti that are frequent in the "caatinga" and almost completely absent from the "cerrado." It appears that the physiological elements are those that really offer greater protection to the plants; in the "caatinga" the species that were physiologically adapted were favored by natural selection. In the "cerrado" even those species that had only morphological adaptations against droughts occurring only occasionally and with low intensity survived. This hypothesis, however, does not explain the absence of xeromorphic structures in the "caatinga". A tentative explanation is based on the balance of favorable and unfavorable effects that such structures might show. The "cerrado" of Emas is not, probably, the maximum of vegetation which the surrounding conditions can maintain, but the "caatinga" of Paulo Afonso is a climax. This conclusion indicates that reforestation and agriculture can be performed successfully in the "cerrado", even without irrigation. In the "caatinga" this will be impossible; there reforestation must depend on species of a low water-consumption, chosen preferentially among the native species of economic value. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ

TI  - Potential of rheometry in detecting cohesive soils in Brazil as an additional tool to morphological field description and tensile resistance quantification
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although an experienced pedologist quickly identifies soils with a cohesive character (similar to hardsetting soils) directly in the field, advances in its correct diagnosis are needed, since the description requires wet and dry soil situations and relies upon qualitative aspects. Taxonomic systems usually consider metrics for other diagnostic attributes (clay fraction activity, abrupt textural change, etc.), but not for the cohesive character, although the latter is environmentally important and is referred to in soil taxonomy systems. Research is especially required at the microscale, where adhesive and cohesive forces are manifested as particle interactions. The aim of this study was to determine whether rheological properties obtained in amplitude sweep tests can serve as indicators of hardsetting or cohesive soils to improve the understanding of underlying processes in such soils. We analyzed soil samples from horizons identified as either cohesive or non-cohesive from six Brazilian soils (Typic Paleudalf, Ultic Hapludalf, Typic Hapludalf, Typic Paleustult, Kandiudox and Hapludox), separated by depth in top, middle and bottom layers. As rheological properties we determined: strain at the end of the linear viscoelastic range (LVR) (gamma LVR), shear stress at the end of the LVR (tau LVR), strain at the yield point (YP) (gamma YP), storage and loss modulus at the YP (G ' G '' YP), maximum shear stress (tau max), strain at the maximum shear stress (gamma tau max), and integral z (Iz). Cohesion only affected gamma LVR in the base position, and had a significant effect on tau max and gamma tau max in the top and middle positions, respectively. Three soil materials did not reach the yield point. The Iz was either higher or lower in cohesive soils compared to non-cohesive soils. Where the Iz was higher in non-cohesive soils, this seems to be linked to a small dilatancy as a consequence of the high friction between soil particles. Also, tau max and Iz showed significant interactions of soil type and cohesion by means of a two-way ANOVA. Soil type had a greater effect on rheological properties, and the Typic Paleudalf had generally higher values. Parallely determined iron, organic carbon and clay contents, bulk density and normal force at the beginning of the test had the greatest impact on rheology. Tensile strength, a property evaluated on the mesoscale, had the closest relationship with gamma tau max and tau max. In conclusion, rheometry can support common analyses to identify the cohesive character, however, for an independent evaluation based upon most sensitive rheological attributes, further testing is needed, with a greater diversity of soils and at different water contents. The possibility to promptly identify cohesive character by quantitative means is essential for effective measures for the mitigation of the mechanical impediments of cohesive soils for agriculture. With the existence of a single parameter to distinguish cohesiveness and its magnitude, different soil management strategies can be easily tested and compared to obtain greater soil workability and, therefore, improved fertility.

TI  - Mixed-species Groups of Marmosets and Tamarins Across a Gradient of Agroforestry Intensification
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyspecific associations are commonly observed in social animals, including primates, and have been interpreted as adaptations either to improve access to resources or to provide protection against predators. Mixed-species associations between Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii) and golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) have been documented, and are unique among Atlantic forest primates. Both species are endemic to southern Bahia where part of the forest has been converted into cacao agroforests, which have been subjected to management intensification. Tree density and canopy connectivity decrease in more intensively managed agroforests, potentially increasing predation risk and the frequency of mixed-species groups between these primates. Here, we test this hypothesis using a standardized, large spatial-scale data set obtained from camera-trapping in 30 sites across an agroforestry landscape mosaic. As expected, the frequency of mixed-species groups increased in more intensively managed agroforests, but only relative to the total number of records of tamarins. Our results highlight that the benefits of mixed-species groups can be asymmetrical among species and variable across the landscape. They corroborate that predation avoidance is an important advantage of mixed-species groups in callitrichids, especially for conspicuous species living in smaller groups, such as the tamarin. Despite the importance of agroforests to conservation, our results indicate that management intensification can increase predation risk for species of conservation concern. To maintain the conservation value of agroforests, management practices should be planned to avoid any loss of canopy connectivity, taking into account the biodiversity vs. productivity trade-off associated with shade management.

TI  - Evaluation of physiological traits in upland rice for adaptation to no-tillage system
T2  - Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology
M3  - Article
AB  - In the cerrado region of Brazil, no-tillage is an alternative management practice to conserve soil and reduce cost of crop production. However, many studies have been showed that there is a decrease in the yield when upland rice is cropped in this system. Therefore, there is a need that new breeding initiatives introgress favorable traits into upland rice for no-tillage adaptation. Key traits include faster emergence, ability to germinate when deep seeded, faster root development, and early canopy closure during the vegetative stages. All those traits can be summarized as "early vigor". So, the objective of this study was to evaluate physiological traits of four contrasting parental upland lice cultivars to verify their adaptation to no-tillage system. A greenhouse experiment with four upland rice cultivars (BRS Primavera, BRS Curinga, BRS Soberana, and Douradao) were planted at three different dates and growth at potential conditions. Development stages, total dry matter, leaf area, leaf dry matter, leaf length, leaf elongation rate and leaf duration were measured and calculated. Based on physiological traits, the four cultivars showed differences in the growth cycle. However, for biomass and leaf area growth and leaf expansion traits they did not differ significantly, probably being the lack of genetic "early vigor" a characteristic of the modern cultivars. The growth and development pattern was significantly affected by planting dates and not by cultivars.

TI  - Sugarcane Straw Contribution to Mitigating the Impacts of Cultivation on the Physical Quality of Oxisol
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane areas show a reduction in soil physical quality. However, few studies demonstrate the effect of sugarcane straw maintenance on soil physical quality along the crop cycle. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the soil physical quality in areas cultivated with sugarcane where straw was kept on soil, after the first and fourth harvests, with that of an area under native forest. Two areas cultivated with sugarcane, representative of the beginning and end of the production cycle, were evaluated in a clayey Oxisol. One area was evaluated after the first mechanical harvest (C1), while the other was evaluated after the fourth harvest (C4). These areas were compared to an area of native forest (NF). The data were subjected to multivariate principal component analysis. Agricultural areas cultivated with sugarcane showed reduction in soil physical quality compared to NF, presenting higher soil penetration resistance (SPR), soil bulk density (Sd) and microporosity (Mic). Sd was 13.7% higher in the C1 area, while in the C4 area such increase was only 5.1% compared to NF. The negative impact of sugarcane cultivation on soil physical quality is reduced after four harvests in areas with mechanical harvesting and where straw was kept on the soil, especially in the 0.00-0.20 m layer.

TI  - Lowland Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems with Grass Crops Increases Pore Connectivity and Permeability, Without Requiring Soil Tillage
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLSs) to improve land-use efficiency is a critical goal. Understanding the ICLS impacts on lowland soils is key to sustainable agricultural practices. Our objective was to test whether adopting ICLSs in lowlands improves soil structure, pore connectivity, and water and air permeability. This study was conducted in a long-term field trial, consisting of the following production systems with flood-irrigation rice: rice-fallow-rice, under conventional tillage and absence of grazing (RFR-ct); rice-grazed ryegrass-rice, under no-tillage and grazing (RGrR-nt); rice-grazed ryegrass-soybean-grazed ryegrass-rice, under no-tillage and grazing (RGrS/RGrR-nt); and a grazed pasture-consortium (winter) and succession field (summer), with no-till rice every 4 years (P4R-nt). Core samples were collected after grazing (October 2018), harvesting (March 2019), and grazing (October 2019). We analyzed soil air permeability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, pore connectivity by computed tomography. Soil tillage in a semi-direct system generated discontinuous porosity. Systems with intense trampling or less surface protection are affected by shearing on topsoil, reducing pore continuity. ICLSs are mainly composed of ryegrass-rice mitigated the harmful effects of trampling, and improved soil structure and functioning. Systems without soil tillage exhibited higher pore connectivity and pores with vertical orientation. Finally, soil tillage is not required to improve structural quality in ICLSs.

TI  - Modelling the potential for soil carbon sequestration using biochar from sugarcane residues in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivation leaves behind around 20 t ha(-1) of biomass residue after harvest and processing. We investigated the potential for sequestering carbon (C) in soil with these residues by partially converting them into biochar (recalcitrant carbon-rich material). First, we modified the RothC model to allow changes in soil C arising from additions of sugarcane-derived biochar. Second, we evaluated the modified model against published field data, and found satisfactory agreement between observed and predicted soil C accumulation. Third, we used the model to explore the potential for soil C sequestration with sugarcane biochar in SAo Paulo State, Brazil. The results show a potential increase in soil C stocks by 2.35 +/- 0.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1) in sugarcane fields across the State at application rates of 4.2 t biochar ha(-1) year(-1). Scaling to the total sugarcane area of the State, this would be 50 Mt of CO2 equivalent year(-1), which is 31% of the CO2 equivalent emissions attributed to the State in 2016. Future research should (a) further validate the model with field experiments; (b) make a full life cycle assessment of the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation, including additional effects of biochar applications on greenhouse gas balances.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks under oil palm plantations in Bahia State, Brazil
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) has been cited as the main raw material for biodiesel production in Brazil. This oilseed is cultivated in the Brazilian Atlantic coast in mixed 'spontaneous' agroforest systems and in commercial plantations. Different oil palm cultivations derived from native rain forest can modify the soil organic carbon (C) dynamics. The aim of our study was to evaluate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after conversion of Atlantic forest into oil palm production in Bahia State, Brazil. Soil samplings were carried out in May 2008 and February 2009 in four areas: Native Atlantic Rain Forest (NARF), a mixed secondary forest/agroforestry Spontaneous System (SPSY), oil palm cultivated during 23 (OP23) and 34 years (OP34). The spatial variability of C and nitrogen (N) contents and the differences in soil C stocks between the avenues (inter-rows) and frond piles in oil palm areas were evaluated. We found the highest soil C contents in the region next the oil palm base (1.22% in OP23 and 1.49% in OP34). The soil C stocks were higher in frond piles (1.7 times in OP23 and 2.6 times in OP34) than in the avenues, due to inputs of soil organic matter by pruned fronds. The soil C stocks adjusted for a mass equivalent and different clay content decreased in SPSY. The OP23 area showed lower SOC stocks compared with native system. However, OP34 area showed the highest C stocks among the areas evaluated with an increase of 25% of the amount of SOC storage found under native vegetation. We found SOC storage of 34.7 Mg ha(-1) and 66.6 Mg ha(-1) under OP23 and OP34, respectively, indicating an increase of soil C stocks in oil palm plantations over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Depth assessed and up-scaling of single case studies might overestimate the role of C sequestration by pastures in the commitments of Brazil's low-carbon agriculture plan
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The reclamation of degraded pastures has a prominent role in the Brazilian climate policy and is one of the main strategies of Brazil's Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan). Here, we aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks in livestock areas under pasture reclamation and contribute to the empirical basis for evaluating the ABC Plan. Based on the assessment of six chronosequences across Brazilian Cerrado, we observed that the effects of management practices for pasture reclamation on soil C and N stocks in livestock areas were quite variable. Any general tendencies depend on the depth evaluated. At the 0-30 cm soil layer, pasture areas under reclamation in Brazilian Cerrado showed an average soil C change rate of 0.47 Mg C ha(-1 )yr(-1). However, for the more in-depth assessment (0-100 cm), the adoption of management practices for pasture reclamation did not affect the average rate of soil C changes for these areas. In this sense, we suggest that an up-scaling from single case studies may lead to overestimations of soil C inventories. Thefore, ABC Plan must review some of its approaches based on general values and extrapolations regarding C sequestration in pasture areas.

TI  - Surface charge alteration of charcoal derived from bamboo leaves and understanding the interaction with anionic and cationic dye
T2  - PHYSICA SCRIPTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cost-effective adsorbents derived from regenerative sources provide a sustainable solution to the pressing environmental pollution challenges. Conventional studies often rely on biochar-based adsorbents obtained at high carbonization temperatures in an induced environment. The present study explored the efficacy of carbon derived from the stems (CBS) and leaves (CBL) of bamboo plants as efficient dye adsorbents at low carbonization temperatures. CBL carbonized at 350 degrees C exhibited a remarkable dye adsorption efficiency of 90%, significantly outperforming CBS, which achieved only 39% efficiency. To enable the adsorption of both dyes, heterophase metal oxides, specifically Fe-doped ZnO and ZnFe2O4 were incorporated. Zeta potential measurements revealed a transition from negative to positive values with metal oxide incorporation, suggesting alterations in the surface acidity and functional group composition. The adsorption performance of the composite (WC20) sample was evaluated using Congo Red (CR) and Crystal Violet (CV) dyes. Comprehensive studies on the adsorption kinetics, isotherm modeling, and thermodynamics have been conducted to identify WC20 as the most effective composite. The equilibrium adsorption data aligned well with the Langmuir isotherm model, demonstrating maximum adsorption capacities of 65.31 mg g-1 for CR and 38.05 mg g-1 for CV at room temperature of 298 K with constant pH. Thermodynamic analysis indicated a hybrid adsorption mechanism, wherein CR adsorption was predominantly driven by chemisorption, whereas CV adsorption was governed by physisorption. Mechanistic insights have revealed that electrostatic interactions and pi-pi stacking play crucial roles in dye removal. These findings underscore the potential applicability of WC20 as a cost-effective and efficient adsorbent for the remediation of both cationic (CV) and anionic (CR) dyes in wastewater, highlighting its viability for future environmental management and pollution mitigation strategies.

TI  - Logging wastes from sustainable forest management as alternative fuels for thermochemical conversion systems in Brazilian Amazon
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Logging wastes of tropical species managed sustainably in the Brazilian Amazon are promising for replacing fossil fuels. However, their use in local energy systems is challenging concerning many mixed-species with unknown properties. This study focuses on the energy characterization of the logging wastes from twenty commercial Amazon species harvested in a sustainable management plan and their energy equivalence to fossil fuels. The wood species were grouped by principal component analysis according to their basic density, moisture content, maximum moisture content, heating value, energy density, and chemical composition. Basic density (0.525-0.895 g cm(-3)), energy density (9.4-16.8 GJ m(-3)), ash (0.3-2.5%), and total extractives (1.8-17.9%) showed wide interspecific variations. On the other hand, the carbon content (49.2-52.4%), total lignin (30.2-38.1%), fixed carbon (16.5-22.0%), volatile matter (76.7-82.8%), and higher heating value (19.1-20.9 MJ kg(-1)) varied less among species. D. excelsa, M. elata, P. altissium, and G. glabra wastes surpassed conventional planted species for bioenergy applications. The logging wastes formed four groups with similar properties aiming at energy systems. The fuelwood value index ranked wastes of D. excelsa wood as the most promising for bioenergy. Finally, D. excelsa wood wastes presented the largest mass of CO(2)eq fixed in 1 m(3) of logging wastes (1,687 kg), meaning that the use of 1 m(3) of these wastes would mitigate the emission of 1,687 kg of CO(2)eq.

TI  - Aligning conservation and development goals with rural community priorities: capacity building for forest health monitoring in an extractive reserve in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural communities are important stewards of forests that provide valuable ecological services. This makes them vital allies to outside organizations seeking to support conservation and development initiatives. However, rural communities also have priorities and needs that may not align with the goals of conservation and development projects. This makes effective engagement of communities by outside organizations an important challenge. When rural communities lose traditional livelihood options, they prioritize economic benefits as a condition for participating in projects, and they exhibit "project fatigue" when many projects are imposed on their time. We reflect on our experience in seeking to align the goals of a conservation and development project with community priorities in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve in Acre, Brazil. Our project featured capacity building for monitoring forest health to foster participation in payments for ecosystem services programs. Although we pursued prior consultations and designed participatory activities, and although we combined knowledge transmission with skills training, participation declined. That prompted our team to consult with community members, which generated important insights about expectations of immediate economic remuneration, community political cultures, communicative practices, and differences among local constituencies. These insights motivated adaptation of our practices via several strategies, such as focusing on young adults and holding workshops as part of community assemblies, which aligned project goals with the priorities of community members to improve project outcomes.

TI  - Soil Physical Properties, Root Distribution, and "Ponkan" Tangerine Yield Across Different Rootstocks in a Deep Tillage Ultisol
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep soil tillage and proper rootstock selection mitigate the root development limitations in Ultisol's Bt horizon, enhancing the citrus yield potential. This study evaluates the root spatial distribution of three Ponkan tangerine rootstocks in Ultisol under deep tillage alongside the physical-hydric attributes and plant measurements. The experimental area underwent furrow creation, subsoiling, and hole opening for planting. The treatments included three rootstocks: "Cravo Santa Cruz" (CSC), "Sunki Tropical" (ST), and "Citrandarin & Iacute;ndio" (CI). Under the Ultisol preparation, these rootstocks were compared to a native forest area (FA). Three years post-initial tillage, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-0.05, 0.35-0.40, and 0.45-0.50 m from the pre-established positions. The evaluation encompassed soil dispersive clay, available water, crop water use, plant measurement, and crop yield. The root evaluation utilized the crop profile method and 2D images, with subsequent surface mapping of the root variables, number (NR), and diameter (RD) analyzed via kriging geostatistical analysis. The Ultisol showed significant changes in its physical-hydric attributes regarding structural change and more excellent clay dispersion, with a considerable contribution to the micropore volume. Deep tillage effectively improved the root spatial distribution, especially concerning the number and diameter of roots, and enhanced the water use, reflected in the vegetative growth and yield, with the rootstock CSC standing out.

TI  - Agroforestry benefit zones:: A tool for the conservation and management of Atlantic forest fragments, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Atlantic forests of Brazil exist largely as remnants in an agricultural landscape, but they are still key reservoirs of biological diversity, Forest fragments are often the only remaining repositories of the biological information needed to guide successful restoration of this endangered ecosystem. These fragments also support the last wild populations of the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus [Mikan]), one of the most endangered primates in the world, as well as other vulnerable and valuable plant species. Activities of local landless people who reside adjacent to the forest are currently depleting the biodiversity of forest fragments. Fires, cattle grazing, and spread of invasive grasses have caused a gradual but continuous erosion of forest biodiversity. Human encroachment affects forest structure and causes loss of many plant and animal species, mainly through edge effects. We present an approach to establish agroforestry benefit zones around forest fragments as a tool for the conservation of Atlantic forest remnants. Both the remaining forests and local farmers benefit from the establishment of agroforestry green belts. A vital aspect of these benefit zones is the use of multipurpose trees and shrubs to provide an insulative/protective zone around fragments, mitigating edge effects. Implicit in this conservation approach are the assumptions that stimulating planting and use of multipurpose trees and shrubs in edge areas places a value on these resources, and that this value will help pave the way to the conservation of forests and wildlife in the Atlantic forest region.

TI  - Inoculation of Brachiaria spp. with the plant growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum brasilense: An environment-friendly component in the reclamation of degraded pastures in the tropics
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates are that in Brazil there are about 180 million hectares of pasturelands, 70% with some degree of degradation. Reclamation of such areas demands re-establishment of soil fertility, plant growth and forage production, and microbial inoculants might help in these processes. We evaluated the ability of two strains of Azospirillum brasilense to promote the growth of two genotypes of Brachiaria spp. (=Urochloa spp.). The experiments were set up at three different sites in Brazil, and forage production estimated for 26 cuts in two years. On average, increases of 5.4% and 22.1% in response to N-fertilizer alone and to N-fertilizer in combination with Azospirillum, respectively, were observed over the non inoculated and non-N-fertilized control treatment. Increase in N accumulation in the biomass in response to Azospirillum was equivalent to a second application of 40 kg of N-fertilizer ha(-1). Estimates attributed to the inoculation were of gains of 0.103 Mg C ha(-1), corresponding to 0309 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1). Inoculation with Azospirillum may represent a key component of programs to reclaim degraded pastures and help sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing soil erosion and its drivers in agricultural landscapes: a case study in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion is a worldwide threat to biodiversity conservation and agricultural yield, and it is linked to deforestation. In this study, we aim to assess soil loss in landscapes of the Cachoeira River watershed, in southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil. We estimate the role of forests in diminishing soil erosion using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). We compare real and simulated scenarios in which the forest was replaced by agricultural use, also comparing estimates of erosivity factor (R factor) derived from remote sensing and climatological station data. Real and simulated annual soil losses varied from 0 to 167.87 t/year and from 0 to 351.81 t/year along the watershed, respectively. However, only 0.04 and 1.67% of this area is highly and severely exposed to erosion, using data from climatological stations and remote sensing, respectively. We showed that soil loss in the simulated deforested scenario was approximately two times higher than the real annual soil loss, indicating the importance of forest cover to mitigate soil erosion. Moreover, soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. Conclusively, the practice of agroforestry can be used as an alternative to avoid erosion. HIGHLIGHTS center dot This paper assessed soil erosion in an important river in Brazil. center dot Real and simulated scenarios of soil loss were discussed in this study. center dot Soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. center dot Soil loss is twice as high in non-forested areas as in forested areas.

TI  - Soil CO2 emission and short-term soil pore class distribution after tillage operations
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Alongside the agricultural development in Brazil, concerns have arisen about its environmental impacts, such as the emissions of CO2 resulting from soil cultivation and management practices in agricultural production systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal variation in CO2 emissions and soil physical attributes in response to the process of soil particle rearrangement after soil tillage operations. The study was conducted in three adjacent areas of 10 x 3 m, subjected to two soil tillage systems: (i) rotary hoe + conventional leveling harrow, representing an intensive soil tillage (IT); (ii) disc harrow + leveling harrow, characterizing a reduced tillage (RT). The soil of the third area was not tilled, representing the no-tillage (NT) system. Daily measurements of soil CO2 emission (FCO2), soil temperature, soil moisture, pore class distribution, bulk density, penetration resistance, water-free pore space, weighted mean diameter, aggregate stability index, total organic carbon, and particulate organic carbon were performed during a period of 29 days after soil tillage. On the first day after tillage, FCO2 was 87% higher in the plot under IT (3.86 iimol m(-2) s(-1)) than RT (2.06 gmol M-2 s(-1)) and 147% higher than in the plot under NT (1.56 mu mol M-2 s(-1)). The variations in soil density and penetration resistance declined as of the 12th day after tillage. This effect was considered a natural process of soil consolidation and influenced the temporal variation of soil CO2 emissions. Pore class distribution is an essential physical attribute to explain the temporal variations of soil CO2 emissions, and these classes are influenced by the applied management. Therefore, the study of these attributes must be taken into account when assessing the variation of CO2 emissions from agricultural soils.

TI  - Long-term effect of surface and incorporated liming in the conversion of natural grassland to no-till system for grain production in a highly acidic sandy-loam Ultisol from South Brazilian Campos
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rate and method of lime application modify soil chemical attributes, but the re-acidification process after liming remains poorly understood in the long-term. This study aimed to assess the long-term effect of surface and incorporated liming on shifting soil use from native grassland of South Brazilian Campos to no-tillage system (NTS) for grain production in a highly acidic sandy-loam Ultisol. In 1994, an experiment in a randomized block with split plot design and four replications was installed in Southern Brazil. The main plot consisted of lime application method (surface or incorporation by soil tillage), while the subplots were lime rates (0.0, 2.0, 8.5 and 17.0 Mg ha(-1)), corresponding, approximately, to 0, 1/8, 1/2, and 1 fold the recommended dose to rise soil pH to 6.0 in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The 2 Mg ha-1 treatment had reapplication every two years until soil accumulated 8 Mg ha-1 of lime. In October 2006 and 2012 (i.e., 12 and 18 years after lime application), soil samples were collected at every centimeter from 1 to 10 cm depth, every 2.5 cm from 10 to 25 cm, every 5 cm from 25 to 50 cm and 50 to 60 cm. The chemical attributes related to soil acidity were evaluated. Even after 18 years of lime application, the re-acidification process recovered only 50% of the exchangeable Al and 30% of the potential acidity compared to native soil. Lime incorporation before NTS adoption proved to be more rapid and efficient to mitigate soil acidity than surface liming, and it is suitable for correction of deep-layered soil acidity in the soil profile. Surface lime application induced a lower alkalinization front in the soil profile, and even after 18 years there was no neutralization of total exchangeable Al in the 10-20 cm layer.

TI  - Identification of current research intensity and influence factors of agricultural nitrogen loss from cropping systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of studies related to agricultural nitrogen (N) losses have been conducted in recent decades worldwide. However, determining if specific N loss pathways are under-researched or overresearched for different country-crop combinations still remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to provide an estimate of crop-specific research deficits or excesses for global cropland ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission, and N leaching from 2001 to 2015 from simulations with the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model and zero-inflated Poisson model integrated with bibliometric metrics (i.e., numbers of publications and researchers). In addition, some major influencing factors affecting cropland N loss patterns were also evaluated. Our analysis showed that corn, wheat, rice, and legumes have received substantially more research focus than other crops due to their greater N losses. Greater amounts of research were always evident in China, the United States, and Australia for cereals; in China, India, the United States, and Japan for rice; and in the United States, Brazil, China, Argentina, and India for legumes. These countries are major crop producers that spend large monetary sums on research and development. Some country-crop combinations, such as millet across the globe, cassava and sorghum in tropical countries, and legumes in Europe, show greater research deficits due to the lower level of economic development or due to agricultural policies in the countries where these crops are produced. Tillage method is sometimes considered the most sensitive driver for various N loss pathways. However, the amount of tillage research tended to be slightly lower than research on climate factors and fertilization. Our results support the urgent need for prioritizing the allocation of agricultural research focus and resources not only with regard to country-crop combinations but also with respect to measures for mitigating N loss in order to enhance environmental and agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Forest and land fire is one of the causes of peatlands deforestation. Forest and land fire occurred at the beginning of land clearing activities for land conversion known as Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Spatio-temporal data mining technique can be used for estimation of deforested peatland area and its association with forest and land fire. The previous study has compared two classified Landsat 8 images in order to estimate the land cover change in Rokan Hilir district, Riau Province. This research aims to develop an application to automate peatland deforestation estimation due to the forest and land fire using the Shiny framework in R programming language. The data used are Landsat 8 images in 2014 and 2016 of Riau Province and MODIS burned area data product (MCD64A1) image in 2015 of Riau Province. The system was developed using Adaptive Software Development (ASD) method. The main features of the system are land cover area comparison and land cover changes due to forest and land fire calculation. The testing results show that both of the features are successfully implemented. With the automation system in estimating deforestation of peatlands due to forest and land fire, the proses of estimating deforestation levels in peatlands in relation to forest and land fire can easily be done.

TI  - Impact of sand mining: A case study of initial growth of forest species for recovery of degraded areas
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vale do Ribeira region has a large extension of Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and in most cities, low environmental impact activities predominate, such as sand mining. Sand mining has been trying to adapt their industrial activities to low environmental impact, aiming at the protection of permanent preservation areas (PPAs) of riparian forests. The objective of this work was to conduct a case study focused on monitoring and initial growth of forest species by 18 months. This study was performed in a riparian forest site on the Ribeira de Iguape River, Registro, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a PPA with extraction of river bed sand. Forest species height, stem diameter and mortality index, and rainfall were evaluated in the period. Non-pioneer species accounted for 42.7 % of the forest, while pioneer species accounted for 53.1 %. These proportions are in accordance with local legislation, which establishes a lower limit of 40 % in planting for both groups. Drought periods and leaf-cutting ants at the beginning of growth stages contributed to a higher mortality index and irregular development of some species, however, even during such adversities, forest species indicated resistance to these conditions. Pioneer species had more important development, with emphasis on Senna multijuga, Alchornea triplinervia, Citharexylum myrianthum and Trema micranta, these species must be taken into consideration during the first stages of a project which aims at recovering degraded areas in riparian forests of Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Ambrosia and bark beetles (Scolytidae: Coleoptera) in pine and eucalypt stands in southern Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 95% of the reforested area in Brazil is covered by exotic Eucalyptus and Pinus plantations. Native Scolytidae, mostly ambrosia beetles, appear to be rapidly adapting to these exotic trees, and reports of economic damage are becoming frequent. The objectives of our research were to survey, characterize and compare the Scolytidae fauna present in a P. taeda and an E. grandis stand in Telemaco Borba, Parana state, Brazil. Beetles were caught in ethanol baited ESALQ-84 vane traps in weekly collections from July 1995 until July 1997. In all, 87 species were trapped, 62 in the pine and 75 in the eucalypt stand. The most abundant beetle species in the pines were Hypothenemus eruditus, Xyleborinus gracilis, Cryptocarenus sp. and Xylosandrus retusus, while the most frequent were H. eruditus, Cryptocarenus sp., H. obscurus, Ambrosiodmus obliquus, and X. gracilis. In the eucalypt stand, H. eruditus, X. retusus, H. obscurus, X. ferrugineus and Microcorthylus minimus were the most abundant species, and H. eruditus, H. obscurus and M. minimus were the most frequently trapped. The majority of the species, regardless of the forest community, were most active between August (end of winter) and October (mid-spring). Significantly more H. eruditus, X. gracilis, Cryptocarenus sp., Corthylus obliquus, Hypothenemus bolivianus, A. obliquus, Sampsonius dampfi and Xyleborus affinis were trapped in the pine stand, while X. retusus, H. obscurus, X. ferrugineus, Xyleborinus linearicollis, Corthylus sp, and Corthylus convexicauda were caught in higher numbers in the eucalypt stand. Approximately 50% of the species trapped were found in both communities. Morisita's similarity index indicates the composition of the two communities is very similar, suggesting that most of the beetles are polyphagous. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mimosa scabrella BENTH. (FABACEAE) ENHANCES THE RESTORATION IN COAL MINING AREAS IN THE ATLANTIC RAINFOREST
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Pilot Reclamation Project (PRP) was developed in 1982 by the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of Santa Catarina-Brazil, with the objective to evaluating the adaptation of woody species to a land degraded by coal mining. After a full topographic reconstitution of the landscape, addition of nutrient load and sowing of herbaceous species, the area was split into 12 plots in which seedlings of 12 tree species were planted: three native trees [Bastardiopsis densiflora (Hook. & Arn.) Hassl., Mimosa scabrella Benth., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake] and nine exotic species [Eucalyptus saligna Sm., E. viminalis Labill., E. citriodora Hook., Grevillea hilliana F.Muell., Hovenia dulcis Thunb, Melia azedarach L., Pinus elliottii Engelm., P. taeda L., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels]. After 22 years, from the beginning of the PRP, the exotic species presented higher percentage of survival than native species; the plots which received either B. densiflora and S. parahyba or were covered only with herbaceous vegetation associated with solely a few shrubs. Conversely, the plots which received seedlings of M. scabrella displayed clear evidence of restoration in progress. The study conducted in plots that have received M. scabrella indicate an improvement of nutrient load (N, K, organic matter) in the substrate, a diversified composition of tree coverage (very similar to the nearby remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest) and other life forms, with prominent establishment of native trees with predominance of zoophilous and zoochorous species. Some characteristics of M. scabrella that could explain its outstanding capacity to enhance the restoration of the Atlantic Rainforest are also discussed along this paper.

TI  - Deforestation narrows pollen diet diversity of generalist orchid bees
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Orchid bee species are important pollinators in the Neotropics. While male orchid bees are known to have a close interaction with odor-rewarding flowers, orchid bee females are often pollen generalists. In the current study, we investigated differences in the pollen diet diversity of orchid bees in various vegetation types and across sites with varying levels of forest cover by means of an analysis of the frass pellets of the orchid bee, Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus, 1758), and multiple species based on a literature review. The pollen grains found in the inner part of brood cells were used to assess the plant composition making up the diet of E. cordata in various areas of the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. We found that this plant composition differed among vegetation types, and that diet specialization was lower in forested areas. Forest cover appeared to be the factor mostly associated with pollen richness in nests of E. cordata. Number of brood cells per nest were also associated with forest cover. The model used to assess the effect of forest cover on plant richness as part of brood diet of E. cordata was tested with the inclusion of published data and a newly generated data for E. annectans. This new data set allowed to understand the influence of forest in the pollen diet of multiple species in a more extensive geographic scale. Forest cover appeared to be important for a diversified pollen diet in several orchid bee species.Implications for insect conservation Since a diversified pollen diet offered to larva bees is associated with bee survival and health, our results indicate that orchid bees relying on areas with higher forest cover have a more resilient population. Such findings emphasize the importance of conservation of forests, especially in the Neotropical region where many pollinator species are adapted to continuous forest environments.

TI  - Dark septate endophytes symbiosis in Falcataria moluccana and its potency for forest and landscape restoration
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Falcataria moluccana is a potential forest tree species with high economic value in indonesia, and it is widely planted in various forests and landscape restorations. The planting of F. moluccana has experienced a decline in productivity attributed to a reduction in site quality and heightened susceptibility to pest and disease infestations. Dark septate endophytes are a group of root endophytic fungi that have potential as biological control and promoter agents. The objective of this study is to evaluate the symbiotic capabilities of various isolates of dark septate endophytes, assess the impact of dark septate endophytes on the sprouting of F. moluccana seeds, and identify the secondary metabolites generated as a result of this symbiotic relationship. METHODS: The study encompassed the employment of three isolates of dark septate endophytes, specifically Rhizopycnis vagum, Curvularia sp., and Dendrothyrium sp. Those isolates were inoculated on the seeds of F. moluccana and observed the endophytism and metabolite compounds produced after 23 hours and 14 days of inoculation time. FINDINGS: Three new findings of this study were: 1) the dark septate endophytes isolates, i.e., Rhizopycnis vagum, Curvularia sp., and Dendrothyrium sp. could colonize F. moluccana seeds on the surface with a colonization rate of 96 percent, 100 percent, and 32.5 percent, and entered the seed tissue and the sprout roots with a colonization rate of 93.3 percent, 93.3 percent, and 70 percent. The dark septate endophytes colonization could be seen at the beginning of germination, inoculation of 0-23 hours, and after germination until observation at the age of 14 days; 2) The dark septate endophytes has the potential to improve seed germination and vigor of F. moluccana, by speeding up the germination process and increasing the vigor index, this condition is expected to produce seeds that can grow and survive environmental stress; 3) The dark septate endophytes has the potential to trigger an increase secondary metabolite compounds in F. moluccana seeds, which can be as antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidants such as the Hexamethyl Cyclotrisilaxane compound, 1-Isopropenyl-4-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene, and Acetamide, 2, 2,2-trifluoroN-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) as a form of plant protection when the F. moluccana seeds grew and developed to be a normal seedling. These conditions are believed to produce high-quality seedlings that can grow and adapt well to their new environment after being outplanted. CONCLUSION: Colonization of F. moluccana seeds by dark septate endophytes does not have a negative impact on seed viability. Therefore, inoculating seeds with dark septate endophytes can serve as an effective seed treatment method, resulting in the production of robust and healthy F. moluccana seedlings. This approach can contribute to enhancing the success of planting efforts aimed at restoring degraded forest and landscape areas.

TI  - Legume winter cover crop (Persian clover) reduces nitrogen requirement and increases grain yield in specialized irrigated hybrid rice system
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - In high-yield irrigated rice systems, options for legume cover crops with the capacity for biological nitrogen (N) fixation in the period between harvest have been sought. However, options are limited due to excess water and low oxygen level in the soil. The persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum) is an exception as it is a promising species due to its adaptation to waterlogged soils. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate accumulated nitrogen in the legume, soil mineral and microbial N levels and the response of a rice hybrid established in succession to persian clover during four growing seasons in subtropical conditions in southern Brazil. The field experiment was carried out during four crop seasons in a 2 x 4 factorial, with two conditions of soil cover, fallow and legume (persian clover) under four levels of N (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg N ha-1). It was observed that the cultivation of Persian clover increased the availability of mineral and microbial N in the soil by 35% and 6.5%, respectively. There was a 14.1% reduction in the optimal nitrogen rate in the rice hybrid. The grain yield of rice grains using persian clover in winter is 7.8% higher in relation to fallow, with the greatest difference between clover and fallow at the lowest N rates (0 e 60 kg ha-1). Thus, persian clover is a promising legume to be used in the period between harvest in hydromorphic soils cultivated with irrigated rice in subtropical conditions.

TI  - Microbial structure and diversity in non-sanitary landfills and association with physicochemical parameters
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the bacterial populations in a non-sanitary landfill around Guarani Aquifer recharge zone in Brazil. Samples from two different positions (sites 1 and 2) at three different depths were evaluated, totaling six solid waste samples; two samples from an impacted stream were also collected. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed using the Ion S5TM XL platform; 3113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 52 phyla were identified. Proteobacteria (37%) and Firmicutes (28%) were the most abundant phyla in the landfill, whereas Proteobacteria (similar to 50%) and Bacteroidetes (similar to 10%) were more profuse in surface water samples. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) enabled us to clearly separate the samples according to their spatial location (site 1 or 2) or environmental matrix (surface water or solid waste samples), showing that microbiological populations are strongly associated with site-specific conditions and the kind of environmental matrix they come from. Environmental factors that mostly influenced the microbial communities were organic matter, oxidation-reduction potential, moisture, alkalinity, nitrogen (TKN), sodium, potassium, and zinc. Exiguobacterium (phylum Firmicutes) was overwhelmingly dominant at site 1 and was associated with higher concentrations of organic matter and potassium. Differently, site 2 did not present such dominant genera and was more diverse having lower concentrations of organic matter and nutrients. Distinct environments co-exist inside the same waste deposit, including zones which are representative of active and closed landfills and the occurrence of considerable physicochemical and microbiological shifts within short distances. Those shifts indicate that microbial populations are well adapted to the heterogeneity typical of urban solid waste, which is possibly beneficial to contaminant degradation.

TI  - ORGANIC MULCH ON EARLY GARLIC CULTIVARS GROWN UNDER SEMIARID CONDITIONS
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil cover with plant residues is a traditional cultural practice in garlic crops, mainly among small producers. Virus-free garlic seeds is a recent technology used in several garlic producing regions of Brazil; it enables the maximum exploration of the productive potential of cultivars. A field experiment was developed from May to September 2018 with the objective of evaluating the use of mulching in early garlic cultivars in semiarid conditions. A randomized block experimental design was used, with a split-plot arrangement and four replications; the plots consisted of treatments with and without mulch in the plots, and the subplots consisted virus-free garlic cultivars (Araguari, Cateto Roxo, Canela de Ema, Centralina, and Gravata) and an infected cultivar (Branco Mossoro). The soil mulch did not affect the plant height and number of leaves, but promoted increases in total and commercial yields of the cultivars, especially the Gravata, indicating that the use of this practice is important to obtain bulbs with higher commercial value; the cultivars Branco Mossoro, Canela de Ema, and Centralina had higher number of cloves per bulb and, thus, are more indicated for the climatic conditions of the region.

TI  - Soil organic C affected by dry-season management of no-till soybean crop rotations in the tropics
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Cover crop species selection for soybean (Glycine max) production under no-tillage (NT) management may affect soil organic C sequestration by altering the quantity and quality of C inputs, thereby affecting cropping system sustainability. If so, the underlying mechanisms for such regulation are still unclear. Methods We assessed changes in soil C and N fractions at 0-0.1 m depth and soil C stock at 0-0.6 m depth during the last three years of dry-season cover cropping in a soybean production system managed with NT for 9 years on a Rhodic Hapludox in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dry-season management treatments were repeated yearly in a split-plot scheme. Main plots during the fall-winter were (1) ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis), (2) grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and (3) the intercropping of ruzigrass and sorghum. Subplots during spring prior to planting soybean were (a) pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), (b) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and (c) forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Results Soil C and N fractions were affected according to crop residue characteristics of the rotations. Higher soil C stocks in 2012 and 2015 (7 % an average) were observed at 0.2-0.4 m depth by ruzigrass compared to sorghum. High crop residue input with ruzigrass in the fall-winter sequestered 0.61 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1) at 0-0.1 m soil depth compared with lower C sequestration using grain sorghum (0.29 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1)). Conclusions The quantity and quality of crop residues impact its retention on soil surface controlling the dynamics of soil C and N fractions and can be considered relevant for soil C sequestration. These aspects could contribute to the mitigation of atmospheric CO2 in crop production systems.

TI  - Assessment of management-dependent nutrient losses in tropical industrial tree plantations
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial tree plantations in the tropics usually follow short rotations and intensive site management including slash and burn, and the use of heavy machinery. We attempt to quantify the implied nutrient losses (harvest export, erosion, slash and burn, leaching) in order to give plantation managers a chance to understand the significance of their planning and decisions. We used the scarce globally available information and a case study plantation in East Kalimantan, Indonesia (Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus deglupta). Adaptation involves problems and is discussed in some detail. Results are approximate only. Assuming a harvest volume of 200 m(3) ha(-1), we assessed a loss of 427-680 kg ha(-1) N, 12-13 kg ha(-1) P, 178-252 kg ha(-1) Ca, 276-370 kg ha(-1) K, and 45-57 kg ha(-1) Mg per rotation. Of this overall loss, stand harvest accounted for 18-29% (N), 21-30% (P), 56-26% (K), 48-64% (Ca) and 22-37% (Mg). This means that the cumulative loss by erosion, slash and burn, and leaching exceeds that of the harvest. These losses can be influenced by management.

TI  - Morphometric analysis of soil aggregates in mined areas at different stages of recovery in the Amazon
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining has a strong influence on the Brazilian economy, however, extractive activity results in multiple damages to the ecosystem, as vegetation and the surface layer of the soil are removed, altering the natural pedological characteristics. Therefore, programs for the recovery of degraded areas become essential to mitigate or compensate for negative impacts on the environment. In this way, the understanding of soil quality indicators has been worked on to evaluate the process of recovery of degraded areas. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop and test a new approach to qualify the recovery of soil aggregation and reference ecosystems in the Brazilian Amazon (RO). For this, the geometric mean diameter (DMG) and the morphometric parameters: area, circularity, roundness and Feret diameter of the soil aggregates were determined. The parameters were evaluated in five different aggregate sizes, 6.0 mm, 4.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.0 mm and 0.71 mu m, then multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed, comparing the morphometric variables and aggregate sizes from each study area. The results obtained show a positive correlation between the values of area, circularity and Feret diameter of soil aggregates, indicating improvements in soil structure and vegetation. In this way, the proposed parameters demonstrated a high capacity to describe the soil quality and differentiate the recovery levels, presenting itself as an excellent indicator in the monitoring of degraded areas.

TI  - Temporal variability and covariance structures of soil temperature in a sugarcane field under different management practices in southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme soil thermal regimes adversely affect soil functioning and reduce crop productivity. Thus, there is the need to understand the extent which soil tillage and mulching can modify extreme soil temperature conditions for optimum crop growth and productivity. The objective of this study was to investigate the residual effect of tillage and introduction of straw mulching on the temporal variability and covariance structures of soil temperature of a sugarcane field in southern Brazil during the 2011/2012 growing season. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD), with split-plot arrangement in three replications. The main treatment consisted of no tillage (NT), chiseling (Chi), compacted no tillage (NTC) and conventional tillage (CT) imposed a year before this study while the sub-plots (new treatments) were straw mulching and no mulching of previous sugarcane trash. Soil bulk density was determined at the middle of soil layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm using the core method. Soil water content (SWC) and temperature were monitored at the middle of soil layers,0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm, respectively in each treatment using TDR and copper-constantan sensors. Soil water content was measured manually while soil temperature data was recorded automatically every thirty (30) minutes. BD was highest (1.76 g cm(-3)) in the 10-20 cm layer of NTC treatment. SWC was lower in the surface layer of all tillage treatments, while straw mulch plots exhibited higher SWC values. Higher average, maximum, minimum and amplitude of soil surface temperature were observed in NTC and NT treatments. Straw mulching significantly influenced the soil thermal regime, as it suppressed the maximum soil surface temperature by 11 degrees C and the average daily temperature by about 4 degrees C during the critical summer period. During the critical winter season, daily average and maximum soil temperatures increased by about 3 and 4 degrees C by straw mulch, respectively. Straw mulching influenced temporal covariance structure of soil temperature. Applied statistical time series analysis of daily soil temperature used certain proportion of previous observations, gave higher coefficient of determination as well as being able to incorporate measurement and model errors, making it better than the corresponding classical linear regression procedure. This study showed that straw mulching could mitigate deleterious effects of supra-optimal temperature and protect the soil from sub-zero thermal conditions during the extreme summer and winter periods, respectively.

TI  - Effects of Tillage and Cover Crops on Total Carbon and Nitrogen Stocks and Particle-Size Fractions of Soil Organic Matter under Onion Crop
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a food crop of economic importance. In Brazil, the crop typically occurs in a conventional tillage system (CT), which favors the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and the loss of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). On the other hand, the no-tillage vegetable system (NTVS) operates based on sustainable pillars and bypasses the adverse effects of CT. This study evaluated the total C and N stocks and particle-size fractions of SOM in NTVS with single and intercropped cover plants compared to vegetable crops under CT. The NTVS evaluated treatments were as follows: (1) spontaneous vegetation (SV); (2) black oats (BO); (3) rye (RY); (4) oilseed radish (OR); (5) RY + OR; and (6) BO + OR. A treatment under CT with millet cover, a no-tillage system with (NTS) millet + velvet + sunflower cover, and a forested area as the original condition was also evaluated. Soil samples were collected in 0-5, 5-10, and 10-30 cm layers. Stocks of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), particulate OC (POC), particulate N (PN), mineral-associated OC (MAOC), and mineral-associated N (MN) were evaluated. The highest stocks of TOC, TN, POC, and NM were found in NTVS compared to CT, and RY + OR showed the best results. The NTVS showed higher TOC and TN stocks with grasses and cruciferous intercropped than NTVS with SV and CT. POC and PN stocks increased in areas with single and intercropped RY and OR treatments. MAOC and MN stocks were higher than forest in RY + OR intercrop in the topsoil layer. RY and OR intercrop efficiently added C and N to the soil under NTVS. The consortium of millet + velvet + sunflower in NTS showed higher TOC, TN, POC, and PN stocks compared to the other treatments (0-5 and 0-30 cm). In general, the intercrop of cover plants is ideal for obtaining the NTVS maximum potential, favoring several mechanisms between soil, plant, and atmosphere, resulting in improved soil quality, increased organic matter, and higher stocks of C and N.

TI  - Selection of Theobroma grandiflorum clones adapted to agroforestry systems using an additive index
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - In fruit tree breeding, selection indices are used to identify the genotypes that combine desirable commercial and non-commercial characteristics. As Theobroma grandiflorum is generally cultivated in agroforestry systems (AFS), there is a need to develop cultivars that are adapted to such environments. In this study, the objective was to select the most promising genotypes for their future use in AFS based on the additive index, a pioneering method for this crop. The trial was carried out for 12 years in an agroforestry system in the municipality of Tome-Acu, Para State, Brazil. The 16 evaluated clones were completely randomised with a variable number of repetitions. The average number of fruits produced as well as the morpho-agronomic characteristics of the fruits were analysed. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the components of variance and predict the genotypic values. The genetic correlation between the variables was estimated, and the selection of genotypes was based on the additive index, with a positive orientation of all variables except the thickness of the fruit shells and the weight of the fruits. Clones 42, 44, 46, 47, 57, 61, and 64 performed well for all the analysed variables, resulting in a selection gain of 7.3% and low incidence rates of witches' broom disease. These genotypes can be made available to producers in the form of clones for use in AFS and can further be included in future hybridisations in T. grandiflorum breeding.

TI  - Agricultural nitrogen loss and downstream effects in the transboundary La Plata basin driven by soybean rotations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue of substantial fertilizer application in soybean fields in South America has led to a potential nitrogen (N) imbalance in croplands, posing a risk to downstream ecosystem stability. A critical strategy for mitigating this risk requires a detailed examination focusing on N surplus and downstream consequences in soybean-intensive watersheds. This study comprehensively assesses N dynamics and downstream effects in areas with soybean rotations across the transboundary La Plata basin in South America. We estimated N surplus and potential N loss through leaching and soil erosion in both established and recently converted soybean rotation fields and analyzed the impact of N surplus reduction scenarios on river N concentration variations. Results indicated that fertilizer N inputs increased by 38 % more than non-fertilizer N inputs from 2001 to 2016, despite biological N fixation contributing 45 % of total N inputs. N surplus increased by 19 % during this period, resulting in high-potential N loss across 31 % of soybean rotation fields. It was estimated that a 20 % reduction in N surplus could decrease total N concentration by 17 % +/- 11 % and nitrate concentration by 16 % +/- 10 % in soybean-intensive watersheds. Reducing N fertilizer inputs in soybean rotation fields, especially in Brazilian and Uruguayan La Plata, is a promising strategy for mitigating N pollution without significantly impacting soybean production. Our findings revealed widespread excessive fertilizer N inputs across the basin, contributing to strategy development for N pollution mitigation and underscoring the need for cross-national collaboration in N management to mitigate water pollution and ensure agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Soil remineralization and recovery of degraded areas: An experience in the tropical region
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many activities related to the expansion of food supply, energy and infrastructure result in great environmental impacts, whose most visible features are observed in the degradation of large areas. The present study demonstrates how the combined use of stonemeal technology and agroforestry systems can help to reverse such impacts, allying the recovery of degraded areas with agricultural and forest production. The study area is located in a hydroelectric reservoir affected by the siltation process and soil erosion in the hydrographic basin of the San Francisco River, Brazil. An Experimental Unit (EU) was set up in the Ecological Station of Pirapitinga (Tre?s Marias reservoir). The design of the EU was based on a factorial design, with seven treatments applied on six native tree species, with three replications (21 blocks). The germination and establishment data of each species were considered in the different treatments. The oxides concentration and fertility level of sediments were analyzed for the determination of the sampling points in the reservoir. The experiment and evaluation were conducted over six years, and the sediments analysis presented high levels of the essential macronutrients K2O, MgO and TiO2, while CaO and Na2O levels were significantly low, due to their high solubility and mobility. The P2O5 also showed equally low values. After two years, soil pH was balanced, especially in the blocks with mineral inputs. P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations were increased up to 5 times more than those of original soil of the EU, and the highest values were found in the remineralizer + sediment treatment. The use of geological material (e.g. mining waste) and organic compost was proved to be an adequate and sustainable technology to mitigate degradation processes. Besides, locally available sources of organic matter enhanced.

TI  - Shading Effects on Marandu Palisadegrass in a Silvopastoral System: Plant Morphological and Physiological Responses
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of plant morphological and physiological responses to shading can contribute to developing sustainable silvopastoral systems (SPS). Our objective was to evaluate the shading effect on herbage accumulation (HA), plant-part composition, physiology, and canopy structural characteristics of Marandu palisadegrass {Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster [syn. Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf]} under intermittent defoliation in a SPS with Eucalyptus urograndis (hybrid of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden and Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake) in Sinop, Mato Grosso, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized complete block arranged under a strip-split-plot, where the plots were allocated to four distances from the Eucalyptus grove (3, 6, 10, and 15-m) in the SPS, on both faces (north and south), with four replications. The evaluations were done during two summer rainy seasons (RS1 and RS2) and one dry season (DS). The herbage accumulation (HA) in RS1 (4290 kg DM ha(-1)) was 51% greater than in RS2. The greatest canopy height, light interception, and leaf area index (LAI) values were measured during RS1 (25 cm, 91%, and 3.5 cm(2) cm(-2), respectively). Leaf photosynthesis rate was less at the 3-m distance (12.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) than at other distances (17.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). We conclude that Marandu palisadegrass has the ability to physiologically adapt to shaded environments, although the dynamics along the whole tree growing cycle needs to be considered so that grass productivity can be sustained in the long-term.

TI  - Least limiting water range and physical quality of soil under groundcover management systems in citrus
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Machinery-based farming operations used for perennial fruit crops often damage soils, particularly if the soil is wet and prone to compaction. We hypothesized that perennial vegetation growing in the interrows of orange orchards can mitigate the soil physical degradation from machinery traffic. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different groundcover management systems on the soil physical quality indicators including the least limiting water range (LLWR). An experiment was started in 1993 in a Typic Paleudult to evaluate three groundcover management systems: Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) with mowing, perennial peanut (Arachis pintoi), and natural regrowth in which weeds were controlled by herbicide. The experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. In May 2003, 216 undisturbed soil samples were collected at 0-0.15-m depths under and between wheel tracks in the orchard interrows. The soil bulk density, soil organic carbon content, resistance to penetration, soil water retention curve and soil resistance to penetration curve were determined in order to estimate the LLWR. The higher LLWR under wheel tracks in Bahia grass compared to perennial peanut or natural regrowth suggest that a better soil physical quality was achieved with Bahia grass.

TI  - Biochar application in Calliandra calothyrsus plantation management
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) is a woody shrub with various characteristics that have made it useful in agroforestry systems. Recently, a biomass gasification power plant (BGPP) is engaging in extending calliandra plantations because of calliandra's high heating value. Since the byproduct of BGPP is biochar, widely known for helping CO2 mitigation, this research aims to integrate biochar application into calliandra plantings. Experiments evaluating biochar applications were implemented on a new farm in Indonesia's Kundur Island, yielding calliandra wood for BGPP and fresh leaves for sheep farming. Chicken manure that had been co-composted with biochar was provided as fertilizer. In nursery experiments, the application of 1.1 kg m(-2) biochar provided the greatest qualified seedlings. A field experiment showed that 1 or 1.25 kg m(-2) biochar application yielded the most sizable wood and fresh leaves. The soil covering with biochar increased the yield of wood and fresh leaves, suggesting biochar mulching could be used for subsequent batches of calliandra regeneration. Thus, this study concluded that the application of biochar benefited calliandra nursery planting, field planting, and shoot regeneration. With a stable monthly temperature, the experiment site could have insufficient calliandra growth due to distinct dry and wet seasons. The regression analysis showed a strong correlation (R-2 > 0.878) between wood production and rainfall, suggesting the growth of calliandra could be predicted from rainfall forecasts. Therefore, a calliandra agroforest system with biochar application and sufficient rainfall could enable a sustainable biomass supply for both BGPP and sheep farming.

TI  - Conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations affects the functional composition of litter and soil Collembola
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

TI  - Fertilizer distribution mechanisms and side dress nitrogen fertilization in upland rice under no-tillage system
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Some crops have shown not to adapt to the no-tillage system (NTS) as a consequence of the compaction of the superficial soil layer. In a certain way, the mechanism used in seeders to open furrows for the deposition of fertilizers can have great importance in facilitating root penetration. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of two fertilizer distribution mechanisms and N fertilization in upland rice (Oryza sativa) under NTS. The experiment was carried out in the growing seasons 2001/2002 and 2002/2003, in Botucatu, state of S (a) over tildeo Paulo, Brazil. A completely randomized block design was applied, with subdivided plots and four replications. Main plots consisted of two furrow opening mechanisms (furrow opener and double disk). Subplots consisted of four side dressing N levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha(-1)). The following parameters were evaluated: furrow and seed deposition depth, plant population, plant height, number of stems and panicles m(-2), number of spikelets per panicle, spikelet fertility, weight of 1,000 grains, shoot dry matter, grain yield and N levels in the flag leaf. The success for upland rice establishment under the NTS in dry winter regions of Brazil is directly associated to the furrow opening mechanism of the seed-drill. The furrow opener mechanism resulted in deeper seed deposition, consequently decreasing seedling population, number of panicles per area and grain yield. Side dressing N fertilization in upland rice under NTS increases grain yield whenever the double disk mechanism is used to sow.

TI  - Quantifying market prevalence, abundance, and suitable habitats of bulbuls in Java, Indonesia.
T2  - Biological Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of bulbuls in the Indonesian cage bird trade raises concerns about its impact on their distributions and, consequently, the ecological balance. This study delves into the trade dynamics of bulbuls, examining their market prevalence and its correlation with their abundance in the wild and their suitable habitats. We conducted bird market surveys across Java, supplemented by online trade surveys to ascertain market prevalence. Concurrently, we collected bulbul's presence data from three databases and field surveys from 2018 to 2023. We used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the suitable habitats for bulbuls. The findings revealed that 20 bulbul species, comprising 11 native and 9 non-native to Java, were encountered in 20 bird markets, totalling 35,715 individuals. Sooty-headed (Pycnonotus aurigaster) and yellow-vented (P. goiavier) bulbuls, both Least Concern, dominated the field-RAI (Relative Abundance Index) and trade-RAI. Notably, rare species such as the strawheaded bulbul (P. zeylanicus, Critically Endangered) and extirpated from Java, were present in markets. We found no relationship between the field-RAI and the trade-RAI, suggesting that all species were sought after regardless of their abundance. However, we found that threatened species face over-harvesting based on the ratio between trade-RAI and field-RAI. A significant portion of predicted suitable habitats for resident species fell outside bird-friendly areas. Urgent intervention measures, targeting small-scale agroforestry landowners and key sites for population protection, are imperative to mitigate the potential ecological consequences of the bulbul trade and ensure their continued contribution to tropical ecosystem health.

TI  - Effects of habitat type, vegetation structure, and proximity to forests on bird species richness in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community in coffee cultivation under different agroforestry management systems in the Macico de Baturite region, Brazil
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been a promising alternative to mitigate the impacts of intensive use of agricultural inputs in coffee plantations and preserve the soil microbiota. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of coffee AFSs on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community, aiming to optimize or validate an agroecological and sustainable system for coffee cultivation in a conservation area located in the Maci & ccedil;o de Baturite region, Ceara state, Brazil. Soil and root samples were obtained in an AFS with coffee cultivated in the Natural/Wild system, an AFS undergoing conversion to the syntropic system, and a conventional AFS. Spore counting, mycorrhizal colonization percentage, and AMF sequencing using the Illumina Miseq platform after DNA extraction and amplification were performed on the samples. Syntropic AFS and conventional AFS showed the highest values of mycorrhizal colonization. However, no differences were observed in the number of glomerospores and beta diversity data among the three AFSs. Around 80 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified in the AFSs. Syntropic AFS had a higher number of ASVs than the other AFSs. These results show that agroecosystem management can influence AMF communities. Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were the most abundant AMF families in the AFSs.

TI  - Artificial canopy bridges improve connectivity in fragmented landscapes: The case of Javan slow lorises in an agroforest environment
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy bridges are increasingly used to reduce fragmentation in tropical habitats yet monitoring of their impact on the behavior of primates remains limited. The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) is endemic to Java, Indonesia, where the species most often occurs in human-dominated, highly patchy landscapes. Slow lorises cannot leap, are highly arboreally adapted, and are vulnerable on the ground. To increase arboreal connectivity, as part of a long-term conservation project in Cipaganti, West Java, we built and monitored seven slow lorises bridges of two types-waterline or rubber-and monitored their use by seven adult individuals from 2016 to 2017. Motion triggered camera traps collected data for 195 +/- standard deviation (SD) 85 days on each bridge. We collected 341.76 hr (179.67 hr before and 162.09 hr after the installation of bridges) of behavioral and home range data via instantaneous sampling every 5 min, and terrestrial behavior (distance and duration of time spent on the ground) via all occurrences sampling. We found that slow lorises used bridges on average 12.9 +/- SD 9.7 days after their installment mainly for traveling. Slow lorises showed a trend toward an increase in their home range size (2.57 ha before, 4.11 ha after; p = 0.063) and reduced ground use (5.98 s/hr before, 0.43 s/hr; p = 0.063) after implementation of bridges. Although the number of feeding trees did not change, new feeding trees were included in the home range, and the proportion of data points spent traveling and exploring significantly decreased (p = 0.018). Waterline bridges serve a purpose to irrigate the crops of local farmers who thus help to maintain the bridges, and also ascribe value to the presence of slow lorises. Other endemic mammal species also used the bridges. We advocate the use and monitoring of artificial canopy bridges as an important supplement for habitat connectivity in conservation interventions.

TI  - Forage yield and nitrogen nutrition dynamics of warm-season native forage genotypes under two shading levels and in full sunlight
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOTECNIA-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful achievement of a highly productive understorey pasture in silvopastoral systems depends on the use of well-adapted forage genotypes, showing good agronomic performance and persistence under shading and grazing. In this study, the herbage dry matter yield (DMY) and nitrogen nutrition dynamics were determined in three native warm-season grasses (Paspalum regnellii, Paspalum dilatatum and Paspalum notatum) and a forage legume (Arachis pintoi) under two shading levels compared with full sun. The experiment was conducted in the Campanha region, Bage, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, during two evaluation cycles (2008/2009 and 2009/2010). Three shade cloth levels (0%, 50% and 80% of light restriction) were applied to the forage genotypes in a split plot design, in which shading levels were the main plot and forage genotypes were the subplots, with three replications. P. regnellii showed the highest accumulated DMY (1500 and 1700 g m(-2), respectively, for the first and second evaluation cycles) at all shading levels and showed no DMY decreased under the heavy shade (80%). Average DMY over the four genotypes under the 50% shade level was higher or equal compared with full sun. Influence of rainfall was observed on the DMY performance of all genotypes: the positive effect of moderate shading (50%) on P. dilatatum and P. notatum DMY was associated to a low soil water availability status. Increased shading level resulted in high nitrogen nutrition index values on grasses, in comparison with full sun. All genotypes performed well under the moderate shading level, but the DMY of both P. regnellii and P. dilatatum and the herbage N content in P. notatum and A. pintoi of all genotypes stood out, showing that those main genotypes are promising to grow in silvopastoral systems at the Campanha region in southern Brazil.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes in brazilian climate-smart agricultural and livestock systems: A systematic and critical overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical climate-smart agriculture could be a cost-effective and scalable nature-based solution toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the coming decades. Nevertheless, the lack of integrated on-farm CO2, CH4, and N2O flux measurements remains a barrier to including these systems in certification programs and the carbon (C) market. This systematic literature review critically examines field-measured GHG emission studies within climate-smart agri-systems in Brazil, aiming to: (i) integrate GHG-measured data, (ii) explore geographical representativeness and connections between organizations and authors, (iii) analyze distributions of studied GHG molecules, climate-smart system types, and productive components, (iv) conduct a meta-analysis on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture, and (v) identify methodological and scope gaps, providing insights for future research directions. The systems considered include no-till, well-managed pasture, integrated croplivestock, and integration with trees (i.e., crop-forestry, livestock-forestry, crop-livestock-forestry, and multistrata agroforestry). Out of 1200 papers mentioning GHGs and climate-smart systems, 74 contained reliable onfarm flux measurements. Most authors were Brazilians affiliated with Embrapa and public Universities. Studies concentrated on the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, with scarce data for other biomes. Over half of the trials assessed individual GHG molecules and only one climate-smart system. Urochloa spp. and Avena spp. were the most studied forage genera, while soybeans and corn dominated annual crops. Eucalyptus spp. and beef cattle were common trees and animals. No-till, integrated crop-livestock, and agricultural integrations involving trees showed soil C-CH4 influx from 0.8 to 1.0 kg ha-1 y-1. Transitioning from pasture monoculture to integrated systems decreased N-N2O emissions by up to 1.63 kg ha-1 y-1. Converting extensive grazed land to intensifiedintegrated systems reduced animal CH4 intensity, with cuts of up to 122 g CH4 per kg of average daily weight gain. Future research must urgently address methodological issues, such as de-standardization (e.g., 8-10 flux units found per GHG molecule) and the absence of crucial ancillary variables. In conclusion, adopting diversified climate-smart agri-systems shows potential to mitigate GHG emissions, but caution is advised when extrapolating our numerical findings due to limited data across Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions. We urge scientists to prioritize frequent on-farm measurements of all three GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) along with agroecosystem C sequestration across multiple climate-smart systems, enabling reliable and comparable net GHG flux calculations to identify the most sustainable option. Advancing and standardizing GHG measurements in Brazil offer an opportunity to enhance GHGs inventory accuracy, calibrate models, and promote policies and investments that expand refined tropical climate-smart agriculture.

TI  - Comparison of soil acidification rates under different land uses in Indonesia
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Increased nitrification risks accelerating soil acidification under land-use change from tropical forest to cropland or plantation, but acidity might be neutralized by net mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) that has accumulated under the former fallow vegetation. We aim to analyze key drivers of soil acidification and acid neutralization under different crops and fallow vegetation. Methods We compared 30 year changes in soil C stocks, pH, and exchangeable Al under different land-uses (primary dipterocarp forest, Macaranga forest, Imperata grassland, Imperata grassland converted to Acacia plantation, Imperata grassland converted to oil palm plantation) in Indonesia and identified the major drivers of acidification using proton budgets in soil. Results Nitrification is major driver of acidification in soil profiles under N-fixing Acacia or fertilized oil palm plantation. Protons generated by product removal and nitrification in oil palm plantation are neutralized partly by fertilizer and mineralization of the native SOM that has formerly accumulated under grassland. The remaining acidity results in accumulation of soil exchangeable Al. The SOM storage under short-term (< 10 yr) grass or long-term (> 10 yr) Macaranga forest increases without intensive acidification, while long-term Acacia plantation maximizes both SOM storage and acidification. Conclusion Magnitude of soil acidification is regulated largely by the balance between proton generation by nitrification of fertilized N and biologically-fixed N and proton consumption by net mineralization of the native SOM that has formerly accumulated under grass fallow. SOM accumulation under Imperata grassland or Macaranga forest could mitigate soil acidification in Acacia or oil palm plantation.

TI  - Farmer Options and Risks in Complex Ecological-Social systems: The FORCES game designed for agroforestry management of upper watersheds
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Serious games have gained popularity as an innovative participatory approach to explore the complexity of social-ecological systems, managing the trade-offs between economic and ecological targets. Serious games can be abstract and generic, or more complex and specific. They can be used to raise awareness, increase shared understanding of options and risks, and/or commitment to common goals. OBJECTIVE: We here aim to clarify design principles applied in the FORCES game (Farmer Options and its Risk in Complex Ecological-Social systems) as single-player game to be easily adaptable to diverse (upper) watershed contexts. Three steps involved are game design (balance generic and site-specific information), game use in (and possibly adaptation to) specified context(s) and evaluation of contextualized impacts. METHODS: The FORCES game design was based on three contrasting watershed case studies in East Java, Indonesia, rather than on single, specific case study. Game development consisted of preparation (defining the context, generic core issues and game objectives), development process (ideating, setting the actors, resources, elements, and mechanisms), and assessment (prototyping, exploration of solution space, game trial and player feedback). Fifty-five smallholders played the FORCES in three landscapes to test the game's performance and impact on participants' insights. Therefore, we recorded every game session and performed pre- and post-game interviews for each participant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The developed FORCES game focuses on decisions of individual farmers involving plot-level plant (annual crops, trees) choices with financial cost-benefits consequences and links to ecological impacts on the litter layer, water balance, and erosion. The FORCES game was successfully applied in three distinct landscapes, demonstrating its adaptability. The game's generic water balance supported the transferability to different contexts, while fine-tuning of plot management options to reflect local variation was simple due to the solid underlying game mechanics. According to players, the game reflects local dynamics in the landscapes and provides a realistic experience, triggering participants to make decisions close to their real-life choices and learn from the consequences. While the game has limited representation of social interactions due to its single-player design, FORCES allowed relational values to be recognized in players' responses. SIGNIFICANCE: Balancing the combination of generic setting with easily adaptable site-specific elements in the game design plays an essential role to increase game adaptability and reusability to different locations. FORCES adds to the growing array of games that can be used to support farmers' participation in higher-level decisionmaking processes to secure environmental services in productive landscapes.

TI  - Local ecological knowledge and perception as a strategy in the management of ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In designing and implementing initiatives to conserve biodiversity and ensure the flow of ecosystem services, it is crucial to understand the perspectives of communities living near protected areas. Improving conservation efforts may depend on analyzing socio-ecological factors and their impact on Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) and perceptions of ecosystem services. We employed participatory methodologies with 80 farmers from agrarian settlements adjacent to protected areas in the Cerrado biome, Brazil, we quantified LEK and assessed perceptions of ecosystem services using an adaptation of the Q-methodology. We collected data on thirteen socio-ecological variables, including age, gender, farm size, education, engagement with conservation initiatives, and interactions with protected areas and Legal Reserves. Using artificial intelligence in a Random Forest (RF) modelling approach, we identified the most influential variables on LEK and perceptions. Our findings demonstrate that engagement in nature conservation and restoration initiatives, along with the use of native areas (protected and managed areas) significantly influence LEK levels within the farmers' communities. Farmers with full participation, from conception to implementation and evaluation of the initiatives, had a significantly higher LEK level (28.5 f 13.0) compared to farmers without participation in those initiatives (11.4 f 5.9). Farmers who used the cerrado for leisure and education (28.2 f 21.2) had significantly higher LEK levels compared to farmers who do not attend or use the cerrado areas (13.5 f 8.9) and those using areas of native vegetation for cattle raising (12.8 f 6.8). These results highlight that, in addition to farmers' participation in conservation and restoration initiatives, the sustainable use of natural areas is fundamental to strengthen their local knowledge of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we found that the type of agroecosystem present on farms strongly? shapes farmers' perceptions of ecosystem services. Farmers perceive different ecosystem services depending on land use, indicating the need for tailored interventions for the planning and management of conservation areas. Farmers practicing soybean monoculture had significantly lower perception scores on ecosystem services (-5.1 f 3.8) than to the other four evaluated groups. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of incorporating local knowledge and perceptions for the design of effective management strategies to increase ecosystem services provision and biodiversity conservation in areas adjacent to protected areas.

TI  - Agroforestry as a Biodiversity Conservation Tool in the Atlantic Forest? Motivations and Limitations for Small-Scale Farmers to Implement Agroforestry Systems in North-Eastern Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry practices support agricultural resilience against climatic variability, increase soil productivity, can diversify and increase farmers' incomes, and support native fauna in agricultural landscapes. However, many farmers are still reluctant to implement agroforestry practices. We distributed questionnaires to 75 agroforestry and 64 "conventional agriculture" small-scale farmers working in the northeastern region of the Atlantic Forest to identify the motivations and limitations to implement agroforestry practices. We reveal the four main reasons why farmers worked with agroforestry: Higher income generation (89%), diversification of the production system (86%), increase in the land's quality and productivity (86%), and increase in self-sufficiency (82%). The three most common mentioned reasons for conventional agriculture farmers to not shift to agroforestry practices were: Uncertainty if the system will work (62%), reduction in yield of the main agricultural crop (43%), and a lack of models and knowledge in the region (41%). Agroforestry in Brazil's Atlantic Forest region can support native fauna, but farmers need to be educated about agroforestry practices and encouraged to switch from conventional agriculture to agroforestry through an increase in available technical assistance and capacitation/training in agroforestry practices.

TI  - Field Application of Mycorrhizal Inoculant Influences Growth, Nutrition, and Physiological Parameters of Corn Plants and Affects Soil Microbiological Attributes
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mycorrhizal inoculants can contribute to the development of corn crops by improving crop productivity. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a mycorrhizal inoculant on the dynamics of root system growth, gas exchange, corn crop productivity, and microbial activity in the rhizospheric soil in a no-till area with different levels of available soil phosphorus. The experiment was conducted during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 growing seasons. At 75 days after plant emergence, root morphological parameters (total root length (cm), average root diameter (mm), root surface area (cm2), and root volume), shoot biomass production, P content in the plant shoots, gas exchange, and microbiological attributes of the rhizospheric soil of corn were evaluated. At the end of the cycle, corn grain yield was determined. A beneficial effect of AMF inoculation was observed on the root and shoot parameters regardless of soil P level. Under conditions of evenly distributed rainfall during the experiment (2019/2020 season), AMF inoculation contributed to a 90% increase in acid phosphatase activity and a 76% increase in microbial biomass carbon (C-BIO), independent of soil P level. In contrast, under water deficit conditions (2020/2021 season), AMF inoculation provided a 29% increase in grain yield. We concluded that introducing a commercial mycorrhizal inoculant in corn benefits root system morphological parameters and physiological traits, and favors the activity of enzymes related to increased P availability, contributing to increased crop productivity in a no-till system.

TI  - Iron oxides as proxies for characterizing anisotropy in soil CO2 emission in sugarcane areas under green harvest
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil CO2 emission (FCO2) is a main contributor of atmospheric carbon transfer and is the subject of research aimed at developing effective methods for characterizing and mitigating CO2 emissions. The FCO2 is related to various soil properties including porosity, density and moisture, which are in turn related to gas transfer, O-2 uptake and CO2 release, as well as mineralogical components (particularly iron oxides, which are closely associated with aggregation and protection of soil organic matter). As estimated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), soil iron oxides such as hematite (Hm) and goethite (Gt) can be useful in determining FCO2. The main objective of this experiment was to assess the usefulness of the mineralogical properties Hm, Gt, and iron oxides extracted by dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (Fe-d) to estimate the FCO2 in a sugarcane area under green harvest in southeastern Brazil. The experiment was conducted using an irregular 50 m x 50 m grid containing 89 sampling points 0.50-10 m apart to assess the soil properties. The FCO2 at each sampling point was measured at the beginning of crop growth and 54 days after planting with the use of two portable LI-COR LI-8100 Soil CO2 Flux Systems. The soil properties studied were found to be spatially dependent and exhibited well-defined anisotropy (particularly the mineralogical properties Hm, Gt and Fe-d). The first two components of a principal component analysis (PC1 and PC2) jointly accounted for 73.4% of the overall result variability with PC1 essentially related to the physical and mineralogical properties of the soil. Based on a multiple linear regression analysis, free water porosity (FWP) and Hm accounted for 71% of the FCO2 variability. Our results indicate that soil preparation and management practices in mechanically harvested sugarcane affect some factors inherent in the soil forming processes, including physical and mineralogical properties, which in turn affect FCO2. These results affirm the potential of DRS as an auxiliary tool for determination of properties that are typically associated with FCO2. In addition, the ensuing method allows for large-area FCO2 mapping to developing greenhouse gas emission inventories for agricultural soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transferability and Upscaling of Fuzzy Classification for Shoreline Change over 30 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local authorities require information on shoreline change for land use decision making. Monitoring shoreline changes is useful for updating shoreline maps used in coastal planning and management. By analysing data over a period of time, where and how fast the coast has changed can be determined. Thereby, we can prevent any development in high risk areas. This study investigated the transferability of a fuzzy classification of shoreline changes and to upscale towards a larger area. Using six sub areas, three strategies were used: (i) Optimizing two FCM (fuzzy c-means) parameters based on the predominant land use/cover of the reference subset, (ii) adopting the class mean and number of classes resulting from the classification of reference subsets to perform FCM on target subsets, and (iii) estimating the optimal level of fuzziness of target subsets. This approach was applied to a series of images to identify shoreline positions in a section of the northern Central Java Province, Indonesia which experienced a severe change of shoreline position over three decades. The extent of shoreline changes was estimated by overlaying shoreline images. Shoreline positions were highlighted to infer the erosion and accretion area along the coast, and the shoreline changes were calculated. From the experimental results, we obtained m (level of fuzziness) values in the range from 1.3 to 1.9 for the seven land use/cover classes that were analysed. Furthermore, for ten images used in this research, we obtained the optimal m = 1.8. For a similar coastal characteristic, this m value can be adopted and the relation between land use/cover and two FCM parameters can shorten the time required to optimise parameters. The proposed method for upscaling and transferring the classification method to a larger, or different, areas is promising showing kappa (kappa) values > 0.80. The results also show an agreement of water membership values between the reference and target subsets indicated by kappa > 0.82. Over the study period, the area exhibited both erosion and accretion. The erosion was indicated by changes into water and changes from non-water into shoreline were observed for approximately 78 km(2). Accretion was due to changes into non-water and changes from water into shoreline for 19.5 km(2). Erosion was severe in the eastern section of the study area, whereas the middle section gained land through reclamation activities. These erosion and accretion processes played an active role in the changes of the shoreline. We conclude that the method is applicable to the current study area. The relation between land use/cover classes and the value of FCM parameters produced in this study can be adopted.

TI  - ADAPTATION OF COTTON GENOTYPES TO AN ACID, MANGANESE TOXIC SOIL
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sixty-five cotton (Gossypium spp.) genotypes (cultivars, strains and breeding lines) were screened in greenhouse pots of an acid (pH 5.1), Mn-toxic Grenada (fine silty, mixed, thermic, typic, Fragiudalffs) silt loam. Nine of these genotypes, plus 2 from Brazil, were compared on the same soil at pH 5.1 vs. pH 6.9. The cotton germ plasma evaluated differed widely in resistance to Mn toxicity as indicated by crinkle leaf symptoms and vegetative top dry weight. Genotypes showing greatest resistance included C-310,73-307, LaDSIS 12513; and LaDASB 12609. Mn sensitive genotypes included C-Sg1,70-517; C-417-2912; and Coker 201. Top dry weights of cotton genotypes on the unlimed, Mn-toxic Grenada soil at pH 5.1 were negatively and highly significantly correlated with crinkle leaf rating. However, top dry weights were not significantly correlated with Mn concentrations in either the 2 youngest leaves (4th or 5th) or in samples composed of the 3 youngest leaves plus petioles. Hence, different internal Mn concentrations are required to induce crinkle leaf symptoms and reduce top dry weights in the different genotypes studied. Crinkle leaf symptoms were significantly and positively correlated with Mn concentrations in the 2 youngest leaves but not with those in leaf plus petiole samples. Cotton genotypes differ significantly in tolerance to excess Mn. The development and use of Mn tolerant cultivars would be helpful in situations where the control of Mn toxicity by soil management may not be economically feasible.

TI  - Edaphic and physiographic attributes and death of cacao trees in drought years
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Occurrence of more frequent events of prolonged periods of low rainfall (drought) in worldwide cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) production zones has not only compromised productivity of small farmers but also crop survival. This study aimed to evaluate how and to what extent cacao tree mortality in dry years is related with variations in soil and physiographic features. The rate of mortality of cacao trees cultivated under an agroforestry system was evaluated over three periods (1994-1995, 2009-2013, and 2015-2019) on 36 plots of a farm in Bahia, Brazil, which has a wide diversity of soils and is established in a region with a subhumid to dry climate. Correlation analyses (single and multiple), cluster analysis, and Tukey tests were performed. The explanatory variables studied were the attributes of two soil layers (physical, mineralogical, and chemical), the diagnostic horizon, and the physiographic attributes (slope, terrain orientation in relation to the sun, and crop shading). The edaphic attributes most related to cacao tree mortality were physical (granulometry, porosity, and density) and mineralogical (Ki), mainly in the subsurface layer. The lowest mortality was observed in Oxisols and on slopes facing south and east. It was possible to establish recommend limits of the most suitable edaphic attributes to ensure greater survival of cacao trees cultivated in regions subject to recurrent water deficit similar to the conditions of this study. These findings can be used to guide farmers on how to mitigate the effect of drought.

TI  - Dairy liquid manure and no-tillage: Physical and hydraulic properties and carbon stocks in a Cambisol of Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of liquid manure is often related to risks of nutrient losses by runoff and thus to the deleterious effects on water quality; but scarce is the information about the beneficial effects of liquid manure on soil physical conditions and its contribution in reducing runoff and nutrient losses in long-term, especially in no-tillage (NT) soils in tropics and subtropics. This study assessed the contributions of dairy liquid manure (DLM) on structural and hydraulic quality and on total organic carbon (TOC) stocks of a sandy clay loam Cambisol under NT, in Southern Brazil. The DLM was applied during 2 years, at rates of 0, 60, 120 and 180 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (DLM-0, DLM-60, DLM-120 and DLM-180, respectively). In the 0-5 cm layer, the application of DLM-180 decreased soil bulk density (1.32 to 1.17 Mg m(-3)), increased macroporosity (0.24 to 0.32 m(3) m(-3)), increased mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (1.59 to 1.94 mm), increased the larger macroaggregates (>4.00 mm), decreased the microaggregates (<0.25 mm) and increased nearly five times the saturated hydraulic conductivity (54 to 246 mm h(-1)), compared to unamended soil. Similar but smaller trends for those properties were observed in 5-10 cm, while no alterations occurred in 10-20 cm layer. Application of DLM increased the soil water sorptivity from 2.78 mm min(-0.5), in unamended soil, to 10.34 mm min(-0.5), in DLM-180-amended, and so the respective infiltration rate from 164 to 241 mm h(-1). The total annual C addition (crops plus manure) increased almost linearly from 5.5 to 10.5 Mg ha(-1) with increments in DLM rate, but increments in TOC stocks in the whole 0-20 cm layer were observed only between unamended (stock of 23.4 Mg C ha(-1)) and amended soils (average stock of 26.5 Mg C ha(-1)), and not among amended soils. In general, findings of structural and hydraulic improvements support the possibility of DLM application to diminish runoff and associated nutrient losses in coarse-textured NT soils in long-term, contributing thus to mitigation of water eutrophication problems. Additionally, the tendency for increments in TOC stocks due to DLM application might indicate a potential of this management practice into promoting C sequestration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil phosphorus fate and its lability after a long-term phosphorus fertilizer strategy in Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to assess the changes in soil phosphorus (P) pools and legacy P after long-term phosphate fertilization. A field study was conducted for 12 years with cotton and soybean crop production in a yearly rotation. Treatments included initial P buildup with five rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha(-1)of P2O5), and annual band-applied P at five rates (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha(-1)of P2O5). Soil was sampled at 0-20 and 20-40 cm and analyzed for soil P pools via a sequential P fractionation scheme. Higher annual P rates (60, 90 and 120 kg ha(-1) of P2O5) improved significantly the residual soil P accumulation in labile fractions (+34, +53 and +67 mg kg(-1) of P, respectively), while no effect of initial P buildup was detected. The cumulative yield increased with annually banded fertilizer rates, with a peak under 91 kg ha(-1)of P2O5, representing a productivity of 4.11 Mg ha(-1) per year across the 12-year period. Thus, P accumulation from annual rates in labile fractions (13%, similar to 110 mg kg(-1) of P) represents promptly available P pool in the soil and may be considered for P fertilizer recommendation programs in crop production systems.

TI  - Urease Inhibitor and Irrigation Management to Mitigate Ammonia Volatilization from Urea in No-Till Corn
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - High nitrogen (N) losses by ammonia (NH3) volatilization from urea can compromise nitrogen fertilization efficiency and corn yield. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of irrigation management and the addition of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) on NH3-N losses from urea and on corn yield. To this end, two experiments were carried out in the 2011/12 crop season on a sandy clay loam Acrisol in the Central Basin region of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Experiment I consisted of two different N sources (urea and urea plus the inhibitor) at a rate of 200 kg ha(-1) N and two corn sowing times [viz., an early time (Sept. 3, 2011) and an intermediate time (Oct. 3, 2011)]. Experiment II considered a combination of three irrigation management systems (viz., without irrigation on the fertilization day and on the next 7 days; 20 mm of water immediately before N fertilization; and 20 mm water after N fertilization) and two N sources (urea and urea plus the inhibitor) at 150 kg ha(-1) N. A control treatment without topdressed N fertilization was also performed in parallel with the two experiments. The NH3-N losses from common urea increased with increasing soil moisture in Experiment I (25 % applied N), and with irrigation before N fertilization in Experiment II (27 % applied N). The inhibitor reduced NH3-N losses from urea by 46 to 80 %. Also, irrigation after fertilization reduced ammonia volatilization by 83 % on average, with little effect from the inhibitor. The effects of the inhibitor and post-fertilization irrigation on the mitigation of NH3 losses by volatilization from urea were not additive; in addition, they led to no increase in corn yield.

TI  - Land-use change affects phosphorus fractions in highly weathered tropical soils
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and land-use change in tropics have increased over the past decades, driven by the demand for agricultural products. Although phosphorus (P) is one of the main limiting nutrients for agricultural productivity in the tropics, the effect of land-use change on P availability remains unclear. The objective was to assess the impacts of land-use change on soil inorganic and organic P fractions of different availability (Hedley sequential fractionation) and on P stocks in highly weathered tropical soils. We compared the P availability under extensive land-use (rubber agroforest) and intensive land-use with moderate fertilization (rubber monoculture plantations) or high fertilization (oil palm monoculture plantations) in Indonesia. The P stock was dominated by inorganic forms (60 to 85%) in all land-use types. Fertilizer application increased easily-available inorganic P (i.e., H2O-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi) in intensive rubber and oil palm plantations compared to rubber agroforest However, the easily-available organic P (NaHCO3-extractable Po) was reduced by half under oil palm and rubber. The decrease of moderately available and non-available P in monoculture plantation means that fertilization maintains only the short-term soil fertility that is not sustainable in the long run due to the depletion of P reserves. The mechanisms of this P reserve depletion are: 1) soil erosion (here assessed by C/P ratio), 2) mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) and 3) P export with yield products. Easily-available P fractions (i.e., H2O-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi and Po) and total organic P were strongly positively correlated with carbon content, suggesting that SOM plays a key role in maintaining P availability. Ecologically based management is therefore necessary to mitigate SOM losses and thus increase the sustainability of agricultural production in P-limited, highly weathered tropical soils.

TI  - Resilience of lowland Atlantic forests in a highly fragmented landscape: Insights on the temporal scale of landscape restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10-40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values.

TI  - Forests as Patrimonies? From Theory to Tangible Processes at Various Scales
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among theoretical fields addressing the conceptualization of interrelationships between nature and society, patrimonial approaches remain relatively unexplored. Stressing the multiplication of local dynamics where elements of nature are redefined as "patrimonies" (ranging from local patrimonies to world heritage) by various social groups, this conceptual field tries to qualify these dynamics and their determiners to understand how they allow us to better address contemporary environmental challenges. Through a multidisciplinary approach in social sciences, centered on rural forests, we analyze the multiplication of patrimonial processes in forest development at various scales. First, we elaborate on the concept of patrimony and on patrimonial processes and present the current construction and dynamics of forest patrimonies. A crucial question concerns the links that form between the many spatial-temporal levels where these processes develop. Moreover, these patrimonial processes can be quite divergent, not only across scales from local to global, but also between "endogenous" (or bottom-up) and "exogenous" (or top-down) processes. We present two detailed examples in Morocco and Sumatra, where patrimonial constructions are developing simultaneously at various scales and through various actors who treat the forest in very different ways. Drawing from these examples, we discuss how and why the simultaneous development of different, often overlapping, patrimonial constructions along these scales allows collaboration or, conversely, can lead their holders into conflict. Lastly, we discuss the contribution of patrimonial concepts to resilience thinking and social-ecological systems theory.

TI  - Enhancing herbicide adsorption in low-fertility soil using sugarcane biochar: Insights from Imazapic dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar amendment has emerged as a potential solution for preventing, remediating, and mitigating agricultural compound pollution. This groundbreaking technique not only improves crucial soil properties like porosity, water retention capacity, cation exchange capacity, and pH, but also intricately impacts the interaction and retention mechanisms of polluting molecules. In this study, we investigate the dynamic of the herbicide Imazapic when subjected to applying pyrolyzed biochars, specifically at temperatures of 300 and 500 degrees C, within the context of a low-fertility soil characterized as dystrophic Yellow Ultisol (YUd) in a sugarcane cultivation area in Igarassu-PE, Brazil. The biochars were produced from sugarcane bagasse by pyrolysis process in a muffle furnace. In laboratory conditions, with saturated soil columns under steady-state, analyses of the mechanisms involved in interaction and transport and determining hydrodispersive parameters for Imazapic were performed by the two- site nonequilibrium transport model using the CXTFIT 2.0 program. Samples of YUd soil amended with biochar pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C presented a negligible interaction with Imazapic. However, adding biochar pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C (BC500) to the soil samples enhanced the adsorption coefficient and improved the interaction with Imazapic. This research points out that biochar produced from agricultural waste biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse specifically pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C, offers a potential means to adsorb herbicides, reducing their leaching to deeper layers of the amended soils and the risk of groundwater contamination and potential environmental negative impacts.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 28th Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists
CL  - Sao Paulo, BRAZIL
AB  - During the past four decades, the Mauritian sugar industry has experienced a decreasing trend in cane productivity partly attributed to deterioration of soil health. Development of new cropping systems (NCS) with emphasis on reduced tillage, controlled traffic through adoption of dual-row spacing, and inclusion of a leguminous fallow break crop between two crop cycles has been proposed as a remedial measure to reduce the decline in soil health. Since 2007, field trials have been conducted in different agro-climatic zones to compare the NCS to the conventional planting method. Cane yields obtained in plant and ratoon cane showed some beneficial effects of the new practices. Yield increase tended to result from an additive effect of each new practice. Cane yield after a legume fallow break was also found to be equivalent or higher than in the conventional planting method despite no N fertiliser application in plant cane and only 50% of required N application for the first ratoon crop. The trials are being pursued to assess other possible advantages as well as any constraints of the NCS.

TI  - Carbon Storage in Soil Size Fractions Under Two Cacao Agroforestry Systems in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaded perennial agroforestry systems contain relatively high quantities of soil carbon (C) resulting from continuous deposition of plant residues; however, the extent to which the C is sequestered in soil will depend on the extent of physical protection of soil organic C (SOC). The main objective of this study was to characterize SOC storage in relation to soil fraction-size classes in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems (AFSs). Two shaded cacao systems and an adjacent natural forest in reddish-yellow Oxisols in Bahia, Brazil were selected. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes to 1 m depth and separated by wet-sieving into three fraction-size classes (> 250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and < 53 mu m)-corresponding to macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt-and-clay size fractions-and analyzed for C content. The total SOC stock did not vary among systems (mean: 302 Mg/ha). On average, 72% of SOC was in macroaggregate-size, 20% in microaggregate-size, and 8% in silt-and-clay size fractions in soil. Sonication of aggregates showed that occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Considering the low level of soil disturbances in cacao AFSs, the C contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. The study shows the role of cacao AFSs in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through accumulation and retention of high amounts of organic C in the soils and suggests the potential benefit of this environmental service to the nearly 6 million cacao farmers worldwide.

TI  - Profit sharing and agroforestry: a theoretical study of potential conflicts in managing illegal logging risk in tropical forests
T2  - THEORETICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Partnership programs have gained importance in forestry management. In Indonesia, profit sharing and agroforestry are examples of partnership programs between forest managers and local communities. In this paper, we analyze potential conflicts among participants in these programs. First, we derive a recursive formula to determine the future value of a compartment of plantation to the society, which includes both the forest owner and the local community. While trees are young, the land is also used for agriculture, which is an agroforestry program. When there is a high rate of future discounting and a high rate of natural disturbances, the society may find it profitable to continue the agricultural use of the land. Second, we calculate the profit for the forest owner and the local community separately. To prevent illegal logging, the owner shares a fraction of the profit obtained by selling logs with the local people, which is a profit-sharing program. Illegal logging greatly reduces the profit for the forest owner, especially when trees are tall. Illegal logging of old cohorts is harmful to the local people as well. In contrast, illegal logging of young cohorts provides profit to the local people because they will be hired to replant young trees. Our analysis shows an overlooking period in which a conflict of interest exists between the forest owner and the local community. We indicate that the overlooking period can be mitigated by coordination of the shared profit and the wage for the workers.

TI  - Ammonia volatilization and yield of corn fertilized with different nitrogen sources in the Brazilian semiarid
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the use of different nitrogen fertilizers on N losses by NH3 volatilization and on the grain yield of a corn (Zea mays) crop grown in the semiarid region of the state of Sergipe, Brazil. Corn was managed under rainfed conditions and conventional tillage. The fertilization treatments were: sulfur-coated urea (SU) and organomineral-coated urea (OMU). Regular urea and ammonium sulfate (AS) were also included as a reference of N sources of high and low NH3-volatilization potential, as well as a control without N fertilization. The N sources were applied to the soil surface at a rate of 150 kg ha(-1) N as side-dressing at the V5 growth stage of corn. The experiment was carried out in 2015 and repeated in 2016. Losses of N through NH3 volatilization differed among the N sources in the two study years, with AS presenting the lowest N losses and regular urea, the highest. In the area treated with OMU, losses by NH3 volatilization were consistently controlled, showing a reduction of 74 and 67% in relation to that of regular urea in both years. SU, however, only mitigated NH3-N losses in 2015, increasing them in 2016, compared with regular urea. Corn plant grain yield and N status, assessed by the index leaf, did not clearly reflect N losses by NH3 volatilization. For the semiarid of Sergipe, OMU is the best ureabased fertilizer to mitigate N losses by NH3 volatilization, and the use of AS is an alternative to increase corn yield and eliminate N losses as NH3.

Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding, gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes.

AB  - Forest vegetation analysis and structure is necessary to understand in order to set up the basis of forest governance and management of the forest plan. This study aims to determine the potential, structure, species composition, and inventory of plant species of the forest stand in the educational forest, namely KHDTK Gunung Bromo. Analysis of vegetation methods on sampling plots 20 x 20 m was made in the forest area to collect trees data. The systematic sampling with the random start was used, with the plot distance 100 m. In total, there are 100 plots were measured. The results showed that total volume and tree densities were 261.66 m(3)/ha and 291 trees/ha. The stand was dominated by the trees with a diameter range of 20 - 30 cm. Species composition is dominated by Pinus merkusii with Species Importance Value (SIV), average volume, and density were 163.23%, 156.67 m(3) /ha, and 202 trees/ha, respectively. However, the sapling stage was dominated by Dalbergia latifolia that showed by SIV 119%, indicating that D. latifolia was able to regenerate itself until the sampling stage. In addition, in the seedling stage, Swietenia macrophylla was the dominant species with density 400 seedling/ha, indicating that seed was adaptive and easily spread.

TI  - Yield-scaled greenhouse gas emissions from flood irrigated rice under long-term conventional tillage and no-till systems in a Humid Subtropical climate
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils under flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) production are one of the major anthropogenic source of CH4 emissions, an important greenhouse gas (GHG) with a 25-times larger global warming potential (GWP) than CO2. No-till systems (NT) systems may be a viable alternative to mitigate GHG emissions in comparison to conventional tillage (CT). The objectives of this study were to evaluate on a field scale the long-term effects of CT and NT systems on soil CH4 and N2O emissions, rice yields and yield-scaled emissions during five growing seasons (GS) in Southern Brazil. In addition, a short-term greenhouse experiment was conducted to isolate the effect of winter crop [ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.)] biomass incorporation on soil CH4 efflux. Averaged across years, the NT system resulted in 21% lower seasonal CH4 emissions than the CT system, at 408 and 517 kg CH4 ha(-1) GS(-1), respectively. No significant effect of tillage system on N2O emissions was observed. Methane emission was responsible for 96.5% of partial GWP (pGWP = CH4 x 25 + N2O x 298), stressing the importance of this GHG for developing low GHGs rice systems. No significant effect of tillage system on rice grain yields (average of 7.8 Mg ha(-1) GS(-1)) was detected. Consequently, the NT system resulted in 23% lower yield-scaled pGWP, at 1.35 and 1.76 kg CO(2)eq kg(-1) grain for NT and CT treatments, respectively. According to the greenhouse study, the incorporation of ryegrass biomass into the soil resulted in 2.8 times larger cumulative CH4 emission than the surface application of biomass, at 347.4 and 125.5 g CH4 m(-2), respectively, due to higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and reduced soil environment in subsurface soil layers. Our results indicate that biomass incorporation is the main cause of higher CH4 emissions from conventionally tilled soil and that NT system is a viable alternative to reduce yield-scaled GHG emissions from flooded rice fields.

TI  - Soil aluminum saturation threshold for subtropical crops in no-tillage system
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Neutralising native soil Al3+ is crucial in subtropical agriculture before implementing no-tillage (NT).Aims The aim of this study was to monitor variations in soil Al saturation and crop yields over 34 years in a field trial under NT, to define the best rate and frequency of lime reapplication for maximum productivity of grain and forage crops.Methods We measured the soil Al3+ saturation in 11 soil sampling seasons in three soil layers (0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 cm). From these 11 soil samplings, the Al saturation was extrapolated for the harvesting day of each crop by fitting a sigmoid model with five parameters. Then, Al saturation values of each year were plotted against the relative crop yields. From that, the critical Al saturation at which crop yield declined by more than 5% was estimated by a linear plateau model.Key results We observed that the yields of six of the 10 soybean crops, and all corn, millet, and black oat crops were not decreased even though the soil had been cultivated for 34 years without reapplying lime. The critical Al saturation values in the 10-15 cm soil layers for soybean, wheat, and cover crops were 44, 24 and 20%, respectively.Conclusions The soybean, corn, and wheat varieties available for Brazil's subtropical region are tolerant to high Al3+ saturation, but responsive to liming. It is possible to maintain high crop yields in the long term by reapplying limestone on the soil surface.Implications It is imperative to establish an agronomic soil profile without Al3+ when adopting NT for a diverse crop rotation system. The combination of NT, Al-tolerant varieties, and reapplication of surface limestone is a suitable strategy to optimise both grain and forage yields.Agricultural production models in subtropical regions should involve the use of Al-tolerant plant varieties that respond well to the application of lime. We have been monitoring soil reacidification and its impact on crop yields for more than 3 decades following the conversion from conventional to no-tillage cultivation. The tolerance of the varieties to Al3+ made it possible to obtain high and stable yields only with superficial reapplications of lime, because the natural potential acidity had been amended when adopting no-tillage.

TI  - Influence of low light intensity and soil flooding on cacao physiology
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth and development of plants frequently are limited by multiple abiotic stresses that occur simultaneously in the environment. 'Cabruca' an agroforestry system is a main cropping system invariably adapted for cultivation of cacao in southern Bahia, Brazil. In this system of management, cacao is grown under the shade of native species of the Atlantic Forest. However, growing cacao under the shade of trees is still questionable due to higher incidence of pests and diseases and difficulty of evaporation of excess soil water in high rainfall periods that often causes flooding. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the performance of two clonal genotypes of cacao, contrasting for tolerance to soil flooding (TSA 792 - tolerant and TSH 774 - intolerant), subjected to four levels of light intensity and two water regimes, control and Hooded, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of tolerance to these stresses under 'Cabruca' environment. All the plants survived the period of flooding, however, with flooding stress visual symptoms like leaf chlorosis, lenticels hypertrophied on the stem base, and decomposition of roots were observed. Obtained results demonstrated morpho-physiological and molecular changes in response to low light intensity and low light intensity x soil flooding interaction. Significant effects (p < 0.05) of isolated factors, double interaction and inter- and intra-genotypic differences (p < 0.05) were observed for leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and growth parameters. Differences among light intensities, water regime, plant organ (p< 0.001), and for the interactions low light intensity x water regime and water regime x plant organ (p < 0.01) were observed with respect to total soluble sugar content. Isolated factors and double and triple interactions (p < 0.01) had significant effects on the starch accumulation. Triple interaction was also observed in the expression of genes coding for ADH, LDH and PDC enzymes and for aquaporin PIP1:2. Low light intensity interacts with soil flooding, limiting the damages caused by flooding in cacao plants under lowest light intensity. Flooding was the dominant factor for the most physiological responses observed during the interaction between light intensity and soil flooding whose physiological adjustments were different amoung the clonal cocoa genotypes assessed.

TI  - Greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from a maize-soybean rotation under no-till as affected by intercropping with forage grass and nitrogen fertilization
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage grasses intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) can increase fertilizer N recovery efficiency in agricultural systems. However, their influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions is still unclear when soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] is grown in rotation. We conducted a two-year (2019-2021) field experiment in Brazil to assess the effect of forage and N fertilization on nitrous oxide (N2O), C dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and NH3 emissions in a maize-soybean rotation. Maize was intercropped with ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis cv. Comum), Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania) and without forage in the whole plots, as well as fertilized (120 kg N ha-1) or not with N in the split plots. Higher N2O and CO2 fluxes occurred shortly after maize sowing in the first year, with low peaks during the experiment. Methane flux had no notable variation across seasons, even with N addition. Growth of forages did not decrease N2O and CH4 emissions compared with monocropped maize; NH3 far exceeded N2O as an N-loss pathway. Normalized (i.e., yield-scaled) N2O and CH4 emissions were lowest in the second crop year, while ruzigrass and Guinea grass increased such emissions for CO2 and NH3. Despite the well-known benefits of land intensification, intercropping maize with tropical forage grasses is not an effective management practice for mitigating GHG and NH3 relative to maize monocropping. Nonetheless, careful interpretation of the experimental data is advised, given the variable rainfall distribution over the two crop years, which affected gas emissions and crop yields.

TI  - Soil compaction on traffic lane due to soil tillage and sugarcane mechanical harvesting operations
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mechanical sugarcane harvesting increases soil compaction due to the intense traffic of agricultural machinery, reducing longevity of sugarcane crops. In order to mitigate the harmful effects caused by agricultural traffic on the soil structure in sugarcane fields, this study evaluated impacts of mechanical sugarcane harvesting on traffic lane under two soil tillage systems based on load bearing capacity models. The experiment was carried out in the region of Piracicaba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a Rhodic Nitisol, under conventional tillage (CT) and deep strip-tillage (DST). For CT soil tillage was applied to the entire area with a heavy disk harrow, at operating depths from 0.20 to 0.30 m followed by a leveling harrow at a depth of 0.15 m. For DST, soil tillage was performed in part of the area at a depth of 0.80 m, forming strip beds for sugarcane planting, while the traffic lanes were not disturbed. Undisturbed soil samples from traffic lanes were used in the uniaxial compression test to quantify preconsolidation pressure and to model the soil load bearing capacity. The surface layer (0.00-0.10 m) was most susceptible to compaction, regardless of the tillage system (CT or DST) used. In the DST, the traffic lane maintained the previous soil stress history and presented higher load bearing capacity (LBC) than the traffic lane in the CT. As in CT the soil was tilled, the stress history was discontinued. This larger LBC in DTS minimized the impacts of the sugarcane harvest. Under CT, additional soil compaction due to mechanical sugarcane harvesting in the traffic lane was observed after the second sugarcane harvest. There was a reduction in load bearing capacity from 165 kPa to 68 kPa under CT and from 230 kPa to 108 kPa under DST, from the first to the second harvest at surface layer. Water content at mechanical harvesting was the most relevant factor to maximize impacts on the soil structure in traffic lanes, for both tillage systems.

TI  - Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change(1,2). However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion(3). Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change(4-6) are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.

TI  - Growth and yield of corn forage intercropped with marandu grass in an agrosilvopastoral system with eucalyptus
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Corn and grass intercropping is an interesting practice, and forage plants belonging to the genus Urochloa are the most commonly used in these situations. These plants show excellent adaptation to low-fertility soil, easy establishment, considerable biomass production, as well as being an important competitor with weeds. In agrosilvopastoral systems, the yield of corn crops grown together with trees is hindered due to the reduced radiation incidence caused by tree shading. This study aimed to evaluate corn growth, light interception, and chlorophyll content when intercropped with marandu grass in an agrosilvopastoral system with one and three eucalyptus rows, and compare them with plants under full sun. The experiment was conducted in Andradina-SP (Brazil). Treatments consisted of intercropping with no eucalyptus (plants under full sun: control), one system with one eucalyptus row and another with three rows. We also assessed the effect of five distances between corn plants and eucalyptus trees (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 m). Between eucalyptus rows, corn plants were intercropped with marandu grass. The analyzed variables were corn plant height, ear height, chlorophyll content index, light interception, dry matter, and fresh and dry forage weights. The experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial scheme plus a control, with four repetitions. Tree arrangements had no influence on corn forage, dry matter, plant height, or ear height. Lower results of yield, dry matter, plant height, and ear height were observed for plants spaced 2 m from trees. In the first two evaluations, significant differences of light interception were found for the different distances. Neither tree arrangements (one and three rows) nor the distances from the trees had any impact on corn heights, with no difference between control and the agrosilvopastoral systems. Neither plant distances from trees nor tree arrangements had an influence on chlorophyll content index of corn plants, with no difference between control and the treatments. As a result, corn growth and forage yield under agroforestry systems are similar in arrangements of 1 and 3 eucalyptus rows (15-month-old trees) and under full sun. However, corn dry matter contents were lower in systems containing trees. Intercropping corn and marandu grass in a system without trees increased light interception at harvest time, indicating a larger soil coverage. Corn forage yield and dry matter content were lower when plants were 2 m apart from eucalyptus trees since this condition provided a lower amount of light and greater competition for water and nutrients.

TI  - Greenhouse gas balance and mitigation of pasture-based dairy production systems in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian cattle production is mostly carried out in pastures, and the need to mitigate the livestock's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its environmental footprint has become an important requirement. The adoption of well-suited breeds and the intensification of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimize the sector's land use. However, further research on tropical systems is necessary. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Holstein (HO) and Jersey-Holstein (JE x HO) crossbred cows in different levels of pasture intensification (continuous grazing system with low stocking rate-CLS; irrigated rotational grazing system with high stocking rate-RHS), and the interaction between these two factors on GHG mitigation. Twenty-four HO and 24 JE x HO crossbred dairy cows were used to evaluate the effect of two grazing systems on milk production and composition, soil GHG emissions, methane (CH4) emission, and soil carbon accumulation (0-100 cm). These variables were used to calculate carbon balance (CB), GHG emission intensity, the number of trees required to mitigate GHG emission, and the land-saving effect. The number of trees necessary to mitigate GHG emission was calculated, considering the C balance within the farm gate. The mitigation of GHG emissions comes from the annual growth rate and accumulation of C in eucalyptus trees' trunks. The CB of all systems and genotypes presented a deficit in carbon (C); there was no difference for genotypes, but RHS was more deficient than CLS (-4.99 to CLS and -28.72 to RHS ton CO2e..ha(-1).year(-1)). The deficit of C on GHG emission intensity was similar between genotypes and higher for RHS (-0.480 to RHS and -0.299 to CLS kg CO2e..kg FCPCmilk(-1)). Lower GHG removals (0.14 to CLS higher than 0.02 to RHS kg CO2e..kg FCPCmilk(-1)) had the greatest influence on the GHG emission intensity of milk production. The deficit number of trees to abatement emissions was higher to HO (-46.06 to HO and -38.37 trees/cow to JE x HO) and to RHS (-51.9 to RHS and -33.05 trees/cow to CLS). However, when the results are expressed per ton of FCPCmilk, there was a difference only between pasture management, requiring -6.34 tree. ton FCPCmilk(-1) for the RHS and -3.99 tree. ton FCPCmilk(-1) for the CLS system. The intensification of pastures resulted in higher milk production and land-saving effect of 2.7 ha. Due to the reservation of the pasture-based dairy systems in increasing soil C sequestration to offset the GHG emissions, especially enteric CH4, planting trees can be used as a mitigation strategy. Also, the land-save effect of intensification can contribute to the issue, since the area spared through the intensification in pasture management becomes available for reforestation with commercial trees.

TI  - Simulating plant productivity under different organic fertilization practices in a maize/native pasture rotation system in semi-arid NE Brazil
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsistence agriculture systems in semi-arid regions need to adapt management to rainfall variability within the constraints of low-cost alternatives. Organic fertilization is generally the best possible option to maintain soil fertility as the use of chemical fertilizers is unfeasible due to the high cost and risks of drought and crop failure. However, the effectiveness of organic fertilization will vary according to the quality and rate of organic fertilizer application, rainfall scenarios and decomposition patterns. Simulation models can be used for a quick evaluation of management strategies in many possible scenarios. In this paper a newly developed model (SALSA: Semi-Arid Latin-america Simulation model for Agroecosystems), was used to simulate, along a 3-year period, plant productivity and soil fertility in a maize/native pasture rotation system in semi-arid NE Brazil. The model simulated reasonably well the observed maize productivity in the experimental plots during the 3 years of the study, even under contrasting rainfall conditions and application of organic fertilizers of different qualities (animal manure or Gliricidia sepium prunings). However, model simulations of native pasture biomass productivity did not adequately represent seasonal and fertilizer responses, in part probably due to the seasonal variability of the pasture species composition. The model showed that the effectiveness of organic fertilization depended upon rainfall with largest response in years with intermediate precipitation, and lower responses in wet and dry years. High nitrogen leaching and cloudiness reduced fertilizer use efficiency in wet years even at high rates of fertilizer application (20 t ha(-1)). Fertilization with G. sepium did not increase aboveground maize productivity compared with animal manure, even though it contained twice the amount of labile fraction. This lack of crop responses to a more labile fertilizer is explained by the large fraction of nitrogen that is leached to deep soil which reduced nitrogen availability in the volume of the soil with the largest amount of crop roots. Management strategies that reduce nitrogen leaching or favor pumping nitrogen from deeper layers (agroforestry) would benefit productivity in this system. The SALSA model proved to have potential as a useful tool to help decisions needed to increase organic fertilization efficiency in NE Brazil even though the base information is scarce compared with modern agriculture.

TI  - Seedling growth and biomass allocation of endemic and threatened shrubs of rupestrian fields
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing anthropogenic pressure in the rare rupestrian fields in southeastern Brazil has led to the expansion of degraded areas on the extremely nutrient-deficient quartzitic soils. on the other hand, the use of rupestrian field native species in reclamation programmes has been hampered by the lack of studies involving seedling physiological ecology. The present study evaluated biomass allocation and seedling growth rate during early seedling growth of four Fabaceae shrubs: Collaea cipoensis, Calliandra fasciculata, Chamaecrista ramosa, and Mimosa foliolosa. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) species proportionally allocate higher biomass to the roots, presenting a high root/shoot ratio; and (ii) species exhibit low phenotypic variation because they have adapted to poor nutritional environments. A 12-month greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate seedling growth and biomass allocation performance in substrates with contrasting levels of soil fertility, The four species studied presented values of root/shoot ratio lower than one in both fertility conditions of the substrate. Growth parameters for Collaea and Calliandra increased with increasing soil fertility, while no differences were observed for Mimosa and Chamaecrista. Although the four species are naturally adapted to low nutritional quality soils, seedling development was not hindered by high fertility substrate conditions. Despite the remarkable differences in fertility between the substrates, the responsiveness in growth and allocation in Chamaecrista and Mimosa was lower than that expected if the species would exhibit high phenotypic variation. The implications for rupestrian field restoration are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Human behaviors determine the direct and indirect impacts of free-ranging dogs on wildlife
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.

TI  - Agronomic performance of sorghum crop under salt stress in soil with plant mulch
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Excess salts in irrigation water affect the production potential of agricultural crops; however, the use of plant mulch can mitigate salt stress. In this context, the objective was to evaluate the yield of sorghum crop under salt stress and different strategies for using plant mulch. The experiment was conducted under field conditions from July to October 2021, in the municipality of Reden & ccedil;& atilde;o, Cear & aacute;, in the Baturit & eacute; Massif region, Brazil. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, referring to the mulching strategies (MS1: with mulch throughout the cycle; MS2: without mulch throughout the cycle; MS3: with mulch during stage 1 = germination until panicle initiation; MS4: with mulch during stage 2 = panicle initiation until flowering; MS5: with mulch during stage 3 = flowering until physiological maturity) and two levels of electrical conductivity of water- ECw (0.8 dS m(-1) and 6.0 dS m(-1)),(-1) ), with 4 repetitions. Using plant mulch throughout the cycle and the control treatment are more efficient for panicle weight. Using plant mulch throughout the cycle under irrigation mitigates salt stress and promotes greater yield in sorghum. From the beginning of panicle appearance until flowering, irrigation with water of lower salinity led to higher yield.

TI  - Environmental filtering of agroforestry systems reduces the risk of biological invasion
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevention is the most effective way of mitigating the negative impacts of exotic species invasions on biodiversity. Preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species. We expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance. If ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically, such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity, supporting the coexistence of closely related species. Here, we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures. We sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the Araponga municipality, Brazil, and measured understory light availability. Phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems. Of the 48 species found, 25 occurred in agroforestry systems, three of which were exotics. Forty-two species were found in monoculture stands (including 13 exotics). As expected, NRI and NTI indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands. Agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species, filtering them from the understory. The mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown; however, shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix. Therefore, agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems.

TI  - Banana and corn interplanting did not reduce the initial growth of individual Khaya senegalensis (Ders.) A. Juss. trees in a dry region of Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the initial growth, survival rate, and biomass content of Khaya senegalensis in a pure plantation system and under an agroforestry system (AFS) with banana and corn. The experiment was carried out in Northeast Brazil and measurements were made when trees were 30 months old. Spacing was 3 x 2 m and 3.5 x 3.5 m in pure plantation and in AFS, respectively. Banana and corn amounted to roughly 816 and 28.000 plants per ha for pure and AFS, respectively. The survival rate (99.7 x 96.1%) and wood density (595 x 551 kg dm(-3)) showed no difference between both systems. Individual growth was similar between both systems (0.0068 m(3) tree(-1)). However, at the stand scale, yield was higher in pure plantation with a mean annual increase of 3.07 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), which means 129% higher than in AFS (1.34 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). Nevertheless, AFS added 20 and 8 t ha(-1) of banana and green corn. Aboveground biomass accumulated at 30 months was 144% higher in the pure plantation (7.11 x 2.92 t ha(-1)), mainly leaf biomass, which was 228% higher in relation to AFS. In long rotation silvicultural systems like those used for African mahogany, only 100-400 trees per hectare will remain until the end of the rotation. As there was no difference in individual growth between the two systems, the AFS could be a very interesting alternative to mitigate establishment costs and optimizing land use with the production of agricultural crops specially to small farmers.

TI  - Use and knowledge of forest plants among the Ribeirinhos, a traditional Amazonian population
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the ethnobotanical use and knowledge of forest plant diversity among the Ribeirinhos, a traditional population of the Brazilian Amazon living in a protected area (Tapajs National Forest, West of Para), and compared the importance of forest plants used in their daily activities with the use of cultivated plants (agrobiodiversity) from their home gardens and swidden-fallows. We used two complementary quantitative ethnobotanical methods, based on (i) daily scan observations in 14 families' homes, and (ii) ethnobotanical inventories of trees, palms and lianas of DBH a parts per thousand yen 5 cm in 23 plots each of 0.1-ha, set up in three types of forests. Analyses of the ethnobotanical surveys in the plots showed that most forest species (120 out of the 140 inventoried, i.e. 86 %) were acknowledged to be useful by the informants (use value > 0) and accounted for 91.2 % of the inventoried individuals measuring DBH a parts per thousand yen 5 cm. However, daily observations of plant gathering in homes showed that only a few forest species considered 'useful' were used daily, whilst species cultivated in gardens and swidden-fallows represented the majority of species used. The Ribeirinhos were also found to know as much about using forest plant diversity, if not more, than other traditional groups from Amazonia or from other tropical regions of South America, including the Amerindians. The article concludes with some recommendations for adapting development practices to local uses of plant diversity in this protected area.

TI  - Mineralogy and phosphorus adsorption in soils of south and central-west Brazil under conventional and no-tillage systems
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The low phosphorus availability in tropical and subtropical soils, normally related to adsorption of phosphate to the minerals surfaces, can be attenuated when organic matter (OM) accumulates in the soils. Herein, we report the results of long-term experiments (18-32 years) aimed at quantifying the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) and its determinant mineralogical variables in Brazilian soils and at assessing the effect of no-tillage (NT) in mitigating the phosphorus adsorption of soils. The MPAC of soils ranged from 297 to 4,561 mg kg(-1) in the 0.00-0.10 m layer and from 285 to 4,961 mg kg(-1) in the 0.10-0.20 m layer. The MPAC was correlated with the concentrations of iron oxides, goethite and ferrihydrite, gibbsite/(gibbsite + kaolinite) ratio and the specific surface area. The OM increased in the 0.00-0.10 m layer of NT soils, which was not reflected on the decrease of MPAC for the no-tillage soils.

TI  - Machine learning as a useful tool for diagnosis of soil compaction under continuous no-tillage in Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Correct diagnosis of the state of soil compaction is a challenge in continuous no-tillage (NT). Aims and methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four machine learning algorithms to diagnose the state of soil compaction (NT and occasional tillage - OT). For these purposes, data from a field experiment conducted in a clayey Typic Hapludox with mechanical (chiselling and subsoiling) and chemical (gypsum and limestone) methods for mitigation of soil compaction were used. To diagnose the state of soil compaction, soil physical properties [soil bulk density, penetration resistance, macroporosity (MAC), microporosity (MIC), air capacity (AC), available water content, relative field capacity and total porosity (TP)] in addition to crop yield (Rel_Yield) were used as predictor variables for Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Key results. The most important variables for predicting the state of soil compaction were Rel_Yield and soil porosity (MAC, TP, MIC and AC). The machine learning algorithms had satisfactory performance in diagnosing which sites were compacted and which were not. The decision tree algorithms (CART and RF) performed better than ANN and SVM, reaching accuracy = 0.90, Kappa index = 0.76 and sensitivity = 0.83. Conclusions and implications. The machine learning algorithm approach proved to be an efficient tool in diagnosing soil compaction in continuous NT, improving decision-making concerning the use of OT.

TI  - Genotype-environment interaction in Gliricidia sepium: Phenotypic stability of provenances for leaf biomass yield
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited multi-location testing has been undertaken in Gliricidia sepium and other agroforestry species compared to field crops and plantation forest tree species. Consequently, information on the stability of the various provenances (accessions) of this species is very limited, reducing the efficiency of germplasm deployment. In this study, genotype-environment interaction and phenotypic stability of 14 accessions were investigated for dry matter (DM) leaf biomass yield across five diverse sites in the tropics (Indonesia and Nigeria) and subtropics (Australia, Malawi and Zambia) using nonparametric methods. Results indicated that genotype-environment interaction is present and that some accessions were unstable across these diverse environments implying that blanket recommendation for germplasm deployment may not be efficient. The most unstable accessions for leaf biomass production in this study include the widely used Retalhuleu provenance, which although highly productive, appeared to be better suited to tropical wetter environments. The Belen Rivas and Monterrico provenances were found to combine high phenotypic stability and high DM leaf biomass yield across these diverse sites. Germplasm of these seed sources may be deployed in previously untested sites with perhaps, predictable DM leaf yields. Where further breeding and selection is envisaged, the results of this study could also be used to make selections and constitute breeding populations for either specific environments (Retalhuleu) or for diverse environments (Belen Rivas and Monterrico).

TI  - Artificial regeneration in gaps and skidding trails after mechanised forest exploitation in Acre, Brazil
T2  - Forest Ecology and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural regeneration of some desirable species under exploitation pressure in Amazon is often very poor or non-existent. The traditional techniques of enrichment planting have presented low performance of the planted seedlings and high costs for its implementation. This study analyzes the first 5 years of growth and survival of five tropical tree species (Bertholletia excelsa, Ceiba pentandra, Torresia acreana, Swietenia macrophylla and Cedrela fissilis) planted in skidding trails and exploitation gaps. The basic planting technique consisted in using the cleared areas after forest harvesting for the establishment of seedlings of species ecologically adapted to the gap environment. The study was carried out in the EMBRAPA-CPAF-ACRE (Agroforestry Research Centre of Acre) in Acre State in West Amazon. The diameter increment varied from 0.30 cm year-1 for Bertholletia to 0.52 cm year-1 for Swietenia and Torresia. After 5 years the height growth was similar for all species around 3.0 m. In the first year Bertholletia presented a high mortality, around 80%, caused by severe predation by rodents. Ceiba also presented a high mortality after the second year of planting probably due the canopy closure. The best survival percentage was presented by Torresia, over 90%. The Meliaceae (Swietenia and Cedrela) species had a similar survival, around 70 to 75%. The Hypsipyla grandella attack was more severe in Cedrela than in Swietenia, but in both cases (9.37 and 31% after 7 and 5 years respectively for Swietenia and Cedrela) was still low when compared with other enrichment plantings.

TI  - Habitat determinants of golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) occupancy of cacao agroforests: Gloomy conservation prospects for management intensification.
T2  - American Journal of Primatology
M3  - Article
AB  - Organismal distributions in human-modified landscapes largely depend on the capacity of any given species to adapt to changes in habitat structure and quality. The golden-headed lion tamarin (GHLT;Leontopithecus chrysomelas) is an Endangered primate from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest whose remaining populations occupy heterogeneous landscapes consisting primarily of shade cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry, locally known ascabrucas. This cash crop can coexist with high densities of native tree species and holds a significant proportion of the native fauna, but its widely extolled wildlife-friendly status is increasingly threatened by management intensification. Although this potentially threatens to reduce the distribution of GHLTs, the main determinants of tamarin's occupancy ofcabrucasremain unknown, thereby limiting our ability to design and implement appropriate conservation practices. We surveyed 16cabrucapatches in southern Bahia, Brazil, and used occupancy modeling to identify the best predictors of GHLT patch occupancy. Key explanatory variables included vegetation structure, critical resources, landscape context, human disturbance, and predation pressure. We found a negative relationship between GHLT occupancy and the prevalence of jackfruit trees (Artocarpus heterophylus), which is likely associated with the low representation of other key food species for GHLTs. Conversely,cabrucasretaining large-diameter canopy trees have a higher probability of GHLT occupancy, likely because these trees provide preferred sleeping sites. Thus, key large tree resources (food and shelter) are currently the main drivers of GHLT occupancy withincabrucaagroecosystems. Since both factors can be directly affected by crop management practices, intensification ofcabrucasmay induce significant habitat impacts on GHLT populations over much of their remaining range-wide distribution.

TI  - Biochar Amendment Enhances Water Retention in a Tropical Sandy Soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of biochar, which is the solid product of biomass pyrolysis, in agricultural soils, has been shown as a strategic solution for building soil carbon stocks and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, biochar amendment might also benefit other key soil processes and services, such as those that are related to water retention, particularly in sandy soils. Here, we conducted an experiment to investigate the potential of biochar to enhance pore size distribution and water retention properties in a tropical sandy soil. Three biochar rates were incorporated (equivalent to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 Mg ha(-1)) into plastic pots containing a sandy Oxisol sampled from a sugarcane field in Brazil. Undisturbed samples of the mixture were collected at two evaluation times (50 and 150 days) and used to determine water retention curves and other soil physical properties. The results showed that biochar amendment decreased soil bulk density and increased water retention capacity, micropore volume, and available water content. Higher soil water retention in amended soil is associated with the inherent characteristics of biochar (e.g., internal porosity) and potential improvements in soil structure. Microporosity and water retention were enhanced with intermediate biochar rate (12.5 Mg ha(-1)), instead of the highest rate (25 Mg ha(-1)) tested. Further studies are needed to validate these results under field conditions.

TI  - Pre-disaster adaptation strategies for houses in landslide-prone residential area, case study of Giripurno Village, Borobudur Sub-District, Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The current adaptation strategies are emphasized based on expanding the community's preparedness. A few discuss increasing resilience by lowering the house's vulnerability. Therefore, we aimed to develop suitable adaptation strategies for houses in a landslide-prone settlement area. We conducted a household survey accompanied by descriptive and cross-tabulation analysis to understand the risk and vulnerability of the houses. We then constructed the adaptation strategies based on the vulnerability assessment of the element at risk. We also estimated the cost of implementing the adaptation strategy as an important finding in this study. The element at risk of landslide-prone settlement of Giripurno Village consists of two groups: houses buried by landslides and houses buried the other sites. Most houses buried by landslides belong to the least secure typology characterized by a low distance to the slope and high landslide deposits. Many houses buried the other sites belong to the most dangerous typology, indicated by their location in an unsafe zone and the absence of a retaining wall. The suitable adaptation strategies are shifting the house to avoid the danger zone, elevating the house to prevent landslide deposits to bury them and give a secure place to evacuate, retrofitting the house by closing the opening and coating the wall with wire mesh, and building a retaining wall. Adaptation strategy cost estimation becomes the key finding. The cost of landslide adaptation strategies through house alteration is lower than implementing agroforestry management. Thus, this adaptation measure can be considered a critical long-term adaptation against landslides.

TI  - Heavy metals in hair of small mammals from the cacao agroforestry and Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42 & PLUSMN; 16.42; Ni - 5.31 & PLUSMN; 4.3; Mn 1.64 & PLUSMN; 2.63; Cu - 1.13 & PLUSMN; 1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28 & PLUSMN; 14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34 & PLUSMN; 0.40; Cu - 1 & PLUSMN; 2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66 & PLUSMN; 18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44 & PLUSMN; 9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived.

TI  - Tree diversity and social-ecological resilience of agroforestry after volcanic ash deposition in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder farmers and their agroecosystems in active volcanic landscapes need to deal with and recover from eruptions. Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social-ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species' survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer's adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

TI  - Agroforestry governance for operationalising the landscape approach: connecting conservation and farming actors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture as well as the associated land clearing are threatening both biodiversity and human wellbeing in tropical areas. Implementing agroforestry systems through a landscape approach has a strong potential for integrating nature conservation objectives into agricultural systems. A key challenge for implementing the landscape approach is that political processes and conservation initiatives operate in 'silos', being largely disconnected from farmers and local key agents responsible for tree governance. In this study we brought together different stakeholders in facilitated, structured focus discussions to analyse the role of actor groups in tree governance. We used social network analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse agroforestry governance networks and actor interactions related to information exchange, finance flows, and regulation. The analyses were conducted at national, sub-national and local levels in four countries: Honduras, Peru, Indonesia, and Uganda. Using trees on farms as a boundary object enabled all participants to bridge common interests and illuminate some of the constraints and opportunities of local governance systems while overcoming institutional and ideological barriers. The quantitative results of the social network analysis identify a strong density of actor linkages. Despite this density, results indicate incoherent and fragmented actor networks undermining the support for agroforestry on all levels. Nevertheless, existing processes related to finance, information, and regulation can be better aligned to ensure an effective implementation and mainstreaming of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation. Building social capital among key actors on both national and local levels can reveal a strong potential for adaptive learning processes mainstreaming agroforestry as essential component of "good farming" and integrating incentive systems for a coherent and effective agroforestry governance. We conclude that redirecting both public and private funding towards continuous seed-funding for the facilitation of these integrated learning processes can transform landscape management and at the same time reduce transaction costs.

TI  - Mitigation of the Gradient of Chemical Properties in the Rooting Zone of Dystrophic Oxisols by Gypsum and Lime Inputs under a No-Till System
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement of soil chemical properties in dystrophic Oxisols managed under long-term no-tillage system (NTS) with surface broadcast lime has been, frequently, restricted to a shallow topsoil layer. As a consequence, a sharply-defined chemical quality gradient is created, with deterioration from the surface towards deeper layers in Oxisols in southern Brazil. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal effects of gypsum, applied alone or in combination with lime, on Ca2+ content and Al3+ saturation in the rooting zone (RZ) (0.00-0.40 m). Four experiments were conducted from 2009 to 2014 in Typic Hapludox soils with distinct chemical qualities in the RZ managed under a long-term NTS (over 20 years) in Rio Grande do Sul (subtropical region). A randomized block experimental design with three replications was used. Experiments I and II were implemented in 2009, with treatments consisting of gypsum rates ranging from 0.0 to 6.5 Mg ha(-1). The other two experiments were implemented in 2011. In experiment III, a split-plot design was used, with plots received gypsum rates ranging from 0.0 to 5.0 Mg ha(-1), and the subplots received two lime rates (0.0 and 2.0 Mg ha(-1)). A split-plot design was also used in experiment IV, with plots receiving gypsum rates ranging from 0.0 to 6.0 Mg ha(-1), and subplots receiving four lime rates, ranging from 0.0 to 4.8 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were stratified in layers at depth from 0.00 to 0.60 m and taken during the period of the experiment. The use of gypsum increased the Ca2+ and SO42--S contents, proportional to the rate applied, and lowered Al3+ saturation throughout the soil profile evaluated. However, an increase in base saturation of the subsoil (0.25-0.60 m layer) was only observed at high rates of gypsum (> 5.0 Mg ha(-1)) in the medium-term and through accumulation of a high rainfall volume. A faster and more pronounced effect of subsoil improvement was observed when the chemical quality of the topsoil layer was already high and when gypsum and lime were applied in combination. Greater improvement in subsoil chemical quality induced by gypsum, alone or in combination with lime, was found in a period exceeding 30 months (Experiments III and IV), remaining for up to 54 months (Experiments I and II). The combination of gypsum with lime was an effective strategy to increase vertical movement of bases in the RZ, mitigating the gradient of chemical quality in dystrophic Oxisol, avoiding discontinuity in the NTS.

TI  - Soil losses in the State of Rondonia, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the state of Rondonia, deforestation, and inadequate soil use and management have intensified the water erosion process, causing degradation of agricultural land. Modeling is a tool that can assist in the adoption of targeted and effective measures for soil and water conservation in the region. In this context, the objective of the research was to model soil losses due to water erosion in the state of Rondonia using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The parameters related to rain erosivity, relief, erodibility, and soil cover, as well as the conservation practices of the state of Rondonia, were considered. The modeling steps were performed with the aid of the Geographic Information System. Results were validated with data of total sediments transported with water discharge. The estimated total soil loss was about 605 million tons per year, corresponding to an average loss of 22.50 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). In 19% of the state, the erosion rate was higher than the soil loss tolerance(T), and these areas should be prioritized for adopting measures to mitigate the erosion process. The RUSLE underestimated the generation of sediments at 0.56 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which corresponds to an error of 18.60%. Results obtained can assist in the development of different soil use and management scenarios and provide options for policymakers to encourage soil conservation in the state of Rondonia.

TI  - Soil amendment and N fertilization strategies to improve C sequestration and storage in soil aggregates
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Management can affect soil quality through changes in carbon (C) stock, especially in protected C fractions of soil aggregates. Soil aggregation and C sequestration may be improved with soil correction (liming and gypsum) and nitrogen (N) fertilization, but it is not clear how these factors might interact to affect humic substances. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and N fertilizatilizer amendments on the accumulation of C, N, and humic substances in soil aggregates from an Oxisoil in Brazil. The production system was no-till soybean [Gycine max (L.) Merr] double-cropped with maize (Zea mays L.) and intercropped with forage grass since 2016. Treatments were no amendment, lime only, and lime + phosphogypsum, factorially arranged with and without annual N fertilization of maize. Soil was collected at 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm 6 years after initiation of the experiment. The combination of lime, gypsum, and N led to 13% greater total C stock and 20% greater total N stock within the 0-60 cm soil profile than the control. Levels of fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) were similar among aggregate classes, but humin was greatest in larger aggregates. Liming plus N decreased FA and HA, but gypsum application mitigated this negative effect. Application of limestone, gypsum, and N increased humin, mainly in the soil surface (0-10 cm). Soil C storage and stabilization was enhanced in large soil aggregates with the combined use of lime, gypsum, and N fertilization in humid tropical soils.Combination of lime, gypsum, and nitrogen fertilization increased soil carbon. Larger aggregates were more important for carbon and nitrogen storage. Gypsum prevented fulvic acid decline under liming and nitrogen fertilization. Greater humin concentration was found in larger soil aggregates.

TI  - Ecological interactions among phlebotomines (Diptera: Psychodidae) in an agroforestry environment of northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phlebotomine vectors transmit parasites and can cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or cutaneous leishmaniasis (TL). Phlebotomine females are hematophagous but need to ingest carbohydrates, possibly promoting the development of protozoan parasites in their digestive tract. The present study evaluated the species composition and abundance across several habitats in a metropolitan landscape, as well as associations among phlebotomines, plants, and local climatic parameters. Three consecutive monthly collections were carried out in an Atlantic Forest fragment, using CDC light traps in peridomestic areas and cashew, coconut, and mango tree. plantations. Eight species of phlebotomine were captured: Evandromyia evandroi, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Psathyromyia shannoni, Sciopemyia sordellii, Evandromyia walkeri, Psychodopygus wellcomei, Nyssomyia whitmani, and Nyssomyia intermedia, primarily from the forest environment. L. longipalpis was confirmed as a species adapted to anthropic environments, while P. wellcomei was shown to be predominately forest-dwelling. Phlebotomines exhibited diversified food consumption patterns in relation to carbohydrate sources. They fed on both native and exotic species of arboreal and shrubby vegetables and gramineous plants.

TI  - Diet specialisation reduces the occupancy of cocoa agroforests by diurnal raptors
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation, especially due to agriculture expansion, pose the main threats to biodiversity conservation. While some species are able to survive and proliferate in human-modified habitats (winner species), others are highly dependent on well-preserved habitats, being more vulnerable to extinction (losers). Many raptors can be considered loser species due to their high trophic position, large home ranges, and low reproductive rates. Consequently, this group is frequently used to reflect the environmental quality of habitats and the biodiversity status of communities. Here we describe the diurnal raptor assemblages found in shaded-cocoa agroforests (cabrucas) of Southern Bahia, Brazil, and the determinants of raptor occupancy in this system. We systematically surveyed diurnal raptors in 16 cabruca sites using complementary sampling methods - active search, playback, and point-count - and modeled species occupancy using covariates related to vegetation structure, landscape, management intensity, and biological traits (body mass, trophic level, and diet specialisation). We found a high number of species (at least 18) as able to use cabrucas and a negative relationship between species occupancy and the degree of diet specialisation. Thus, our results suggest that cabrucas have a high potential to mitigate the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on diurnal raptors, but this system alone may not support complete assemblages of this group. It highlights the need for the maintenance of forest remnants in the landscapes to increase species diversity at a regional scale and to assure the conservation of this group in Southern Bahian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen stocks and organic matter fractions in the topsoil of traditional and agrisilvicultural systems in the Southeast of Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Y The adoption of conservationist systems can improve the protection of soil organic matter (SOM) and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, we aimed to quantify the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, C content in the SOM fractions and microbial C (C-mic) in the topsoil of an Acrisol under traditional and agrisilvicultural systems in the Southeast of Brazil. The evaluated treatments were native vegetation of Cerrado (NV), pasture of Urochloa brizantha (PAST), monoculture of pigeon pea (MCP), and agrisilvicultural system (Eucalyptus + pigeon pea; AGS). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm to determine the soil C and N contents and stocks, C associated with granulometric and humic fractions of SOM, and soil C-mic. The C contents in AGS and MCP systems were similar to NV at 5-10 and 10-20 cm, and soil C stocks in AGS were similar to NV and higher than in PAST system at 0-20 cm. We found a higher percentage of protected C in the silt + clay fraction, and the AGS system contributed to an increase in this organomineral fraction at 10-20 cm soil depth. The C contents in the free light fraction (0-5 cm) and humin (5-10 and 10-20 cm) were also similar between AGS and NV, giving greater protection of SOM in both systems. For C-mic and microbial quotient values we found no differences among the evaluated systems. The results indicated that after conversion of NV to different land uses, the AGS system more effectively increased the C stocks in the topsoil and protected the SOM.

TI  - Effects of different cultivation systems in leaf traits and herbivory damage in Ilex paraguariensis (Aquifoliaceae)
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different environmental conditions are crucial to determine many attributes in plants by selective pressures. Plant traits and ecological interactions may present variation in outputs in these distinctive selection scenarios. In south Brazil, yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) has been cultivated in monoculture and in consortium systems, differing significantly in lightning intensity and associated plant richness. In this study, three areas of both cultivation systems were monitored to verify the plant outputs in leaf area and herbivory damage. Our results showed that consortium system cultivation presents higher values of leaf area and higher damage by herbivory. Higher leaf area in consortium system corresponds to numerous studies and corroborates the phenotypic plasticity expected for Ilex paraguariensis. On the other hand, the higher leaf damage opposed the hypothesis that greater plant richness should promote the best herbivory control by natural enemies. Despite the higher foliar loss plants cultivated under consortium-system present adequate leaf area to farmers. Beside species richness, other plant community traits play important role in mitigation of herbivory.

TI  - Termite assemblage collapse along a land-use intensification gradient in lowland central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Termites are major decomposers in tropical regions and play an important role in soil processes. This study measured the impact of land-use intensification on the termite assemblage of lowland rain forest in Jambi Province, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Termite composition was assessed in seven land-use types along a disturbance gradient, from primary forest, through different silvicultural systems, to grassland and cultivated land without trees. A range of environmental variables was also measured.2. Termite species richness and relative abundance declined as follows: primary forest > selectively logged forest > mature 'jungle rubber' (a diverse agro-forest dominated by rubber trees) > mature rubber plantation > young Paraserianthes falcataria plantation (a softwood tree) > Imperata cylindrica grassland > cassava garden. Termite richness fell from 34 species in the primary forest to one species in the cassava garden. The relative abundance of soil-feeding termites showed a significantly greater decline along the gradient than did wood-feeding termites.3. Of the environmental variables, woody plant basal area was most strongly correlated with termite species richness (r = 0.973) and relative abundance (r = 0.980). This reflects the response of forest-adapted termites to progressive simplification of the physical structure of the habitat, resulting in the reduction of canopy cover and alteration in microclimate, and the loss of feeding and nesting sites.4. Synthesis and applications . Comparisons with other studies show that the decline in termite species richness and relative abundance seen at Jambi is a general trend that occurs elsewhere when forests are converted to other land uses. To help mitigate the loss of termites when forests are disturbed, we recommend the following management practices: the use of reduced-impact logging techniques, maximizing forest patch size and connectivity, minimizing length of forest edges, and leaving dead wood to decay in situ .

TI  - FARMER ADOPTION OF CONTOUR HEDGEROW INTERCROPPING, A CASE-STUDY FROM EAST INDONESIA
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of a study to assess the initial impact of the introduction of contour hedgerow intercropping on the Indonesian islands of Lombok and Sumbawa are described. The study focused on the reasons for adopting this technique and its initial effect. The results of detailed case studies in four villages indicated that the process of adoption is heterogeneous. Land-use conditions in the four villages were much more diverse and dynamic than the project anticipated. Rather than being an 'off the shelf technique as assumed by the project, hedgerow cropping proved to be a 'prototype' technique; the farmers' ability to adapt the practice to their specific farming conditions such as subsistence food production or cash crop cultivation was an important motive for its adoption. In some cases the introduction competed with the extension of other promising land-use practices. Several farmers adopted the technique not because of its productive benefits, but as a means to gain access to land or credit, or to demonstrate their allegiance to social networks. The results indicate that there were significant discontinuities between what the project intended to achieve by introducing the technique and the farmers' motives for adopting it.

CP  - International Workshop on Land-Use Change and Greenhouse Gases, Soil C and Nutrient Cycling in the Tropics
CL  - Natl Inst Agro-Environm Sci, Tsukuba, JAPAN
AB  - Losses of carbon (C) stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are challenges that scientists and policy makers have been facing in the recent past. Intensified agricultural practices lead to a reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks, mainly due to removal of aboveground biomass as harvest and loss of carbon as CO2 through burning and/or decomposition. Evidence is emerging that agroforestry systems are promising management practices to increase aboveground and soil C stocks and reduce soil degradation, as well as to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In the humid tropics, the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in vegetation can be over 70 Mg C ha(-1), and up to 25 Mg ha(-1) in the top 20 cm of soil. In degraded soils of the sub-humid tropics, improved fallow agroforestry practices have been found to increase top soil C stocks up to 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) above continuous maize cropping. Soil C accretion is linked to the structural development of the soil, in particular to increasing C in water stable aggregates (WSA). A review of agroforestry practices in the humid tropics showed that these systems were able to mitigate N2O and CO2 emissions from soils and increase the CH4 Sink strength compared to cropping systems. The increase in N2O and CO2 emissions after addition of legume residues in improved fallow systems in the sub-humid tropics indicates the importance of using lower quality organic inputs and increasing nutrient use efficiency to derive more direct and indirect benefits from the system. In summary, these examples provide evidence of several pathways by which agroforestry systems can increase C sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

T2  - Acta Zoologica Mexicana Nueva Serie
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation of the Amazonian rainforest and conversion to agriculture with the use of fire creates a mosaic of occupied lands and secondary forests. Considering the fundamental role of soil macrofauna and the lack of information about its resilience to deforestation, this study characterized the earthworms, ants and other soil arthropod communities in secondary forests of 40 and 20 years of age and in cropping system and pastures prepared with slash-and-burn or chop-and-mulch in the Brazilian Eastern Amazonia. Soil macrofauna was sampled according to the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biological and Fertility) methodology. Four sub-indices and one "macrofauna soil health index" were calculated using five principal component analyses. The macrofauna index identified better soil health in chop-and-mulch crops, followed by the 40 yr-old forest and the chop-and-mulch pasture. These results confirmed the fundamental role of old secondary forests for soil biodiversity conservation and the potential of the chop-and-mulch technique to mitigate the effects of land use changes.

TI  - Simulation of sediment transport in Krueng Baro River, Indonesia
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - An alluvial river system is a dynamic system that can alter the hydraulic flow and sediment load. Sediment modelling can enhance our understanding of river morphology. This model has also proved to be a useful tool to overcome problems concerning sediment transport and sedimentation and to provide effective mitigation measures. This article discussed the concept of sediment modelling. The sediment transport simulation method used sediment river hydraulic - two dimension (SRH-2D), which is a hydraulic model for river systems developed by United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The SRH-2D results showed that the Krueng Baro River underwent many sedimentations, and the increase in the height of the layers was observed during the simulation period. It examined the main categories of sediment transport models and presented the boundaries. Besides, this study also considered the constraints on the operation of Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (Indonesian regional water utility company) (PDAM) and irrigation intakes because of the sedimentation in the Krueng Baro River flow, taking into account the structure of the Keumala weir. Specifically, this study thoroughly discussed the position and altitude of river aggradation and degradation to minimise conflict of interest between the PDAM and irrigation water supply because of sedimentation.

TI  - High critical forest habitat thresholds of native bird communities in Afrotropical agroforestry landscapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Our knowledge on the relationship between tropical forest cover and biotic communities is still limited. Understanding the relationship between forest cover and bird functional guilds may serve as a valuable tool to assess how much forest is necessary to conserve significant portions of typical forest assemblages. We sampled birds (198 species, 6883 encounters) along a full gradient of deforestation across 4000 km(2) of forest-dominated landscapes in Southwest Cameroon and applied multivariate adaptive regression splines to model alpha-, beta- and gamma-richness of guilds in relation to forest cover. Overall, beta- and gamma-richness remained constant above 42% forest cover. However, total alpha-richness as well as all richness partitions of Guinea-Congo biome-restricted, large-bodied arboreal foliage gleaning, tree nesting, and frugivorous species declined when forest cover was below 74%. Moreover, ant-followers and terrestrial insectivores showed their highest diversity at zero deforestation. In contrast, open-land, granivorous, opportunistic insectivorous and widespread species strongly increased below 42% forest cover. High beta-diversity at intermediate deforestation conditions indicate that the sharp decline of original forest bird diversity may only be compensated by habitat and foraging generalists, which benefit from high habitat heterogeneity. Our study implies that Afrotropical forest bird diversity decreases non-linearly with forest loss. Critical habitat thresholds estimated by us at above 70% are much higher than those previously reported and highlight the need to integrate substantial proportions of natural vegetation within wildlife friendly farming schemes.

TI  - Effect of Organic Amendment on the Physicochemical Characteristics of Tailings Dam Soil and Root Development of Tree Species, Fifteen Years After Planting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Among mine wastes, tailings are known to have the largest environmental impact, as they have high concentrations of trace elements and are susceptible to wind dispersal and water erosion. A tree plantation trial was installed at Kipushi tailing (DR Congo) in order to mitigate the contaminant dispersal in the surrounding areas. Fifteen years later, the present study was conducted for the purpose of investigating the macronutrient and metal content in amended holes and assessing the performance of tree species through root behavior in the tailings dams. Results show elevated available P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration in the surface and amended layers, which is higher than the unpolluted soil of the miombo woodland. Trace metals were manifold higher compared to the pedo-geochemical background of the region, with Cu and Co concentration tending to increase in the organic matter-rich layers, while Zn, Cd, Pb, and As remained higher in tailings. Compared to the tailing layer, roots grew well in the amended layers, but few roots ranging from very fine to big from all the surviving species were able to grow beyond the amended layers, indicating the possibility of tree survival on the tailings dams over many years. Acacia polyacantha and Psidium guajava are species that showed a higher quantity of roots in the unamended tailing layers. Leaves should be avoided for human or animal consumption, but as the concentration of Cu, Zn, and Co in guava was lower, there is no indication of hazards in case of their consumption. Therefore, the use of well-adapted tree species on the mix-up of the organic amendments with the uncontaminated topsoil seemed to be a good technique for the reclamation of larger polluted areas.

TI  - Local perceptions of forest certification for community-based enterprises
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification has been promoted as a way to encourage and recognize community-based forest enterprises (CFEs). However, certification has proved more difficult for CFEs than expected, and few certified operations have achieved the highly anticipated market benefits of certification. This has led to questioning of the compatibility of certification with CFEs, though few studies have directly asked local CFE actors their perceptions on this issue. This study investigates perceptions of certification for two CFEs in Brazil's western Amazon. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to determine the positive and negative aspects of certification as perceived by community members, their principal support organizations, and other key stakeholders, (2) to identify the relative importance of these perceived positive and negative aspects, and (3) to analyze the differences in perceptions between actors. Data were collected through structured interviews and a review of pertinent documents.Overall, the most positive aspects were economic and social, and the most negative aspects concerned the certification process and, to a lesser extent, the associated economic expenditures. Community members typically scored the positive aspects higher and the negative aspects lower than the support organizations. This is likely due to differences in roles and vantage points of these actors. In general, informants agreed that positive aspects of certification outweighed negative ones. This stands in contrast to some communities in other parts of Latin America that are contemplating dropping certification.Two particular conditions may have enabled operations in this study to overcome common constraints for CFEs: (1) membership in a regional producers group, and (2) strong political, technical, and financial support from the state government. Their experiences specifically highlight the need to adapt the certification process for CFEs and demonstrate that obtaining market benefits is possible. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The cacao agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic forest as habitat for the endangered maned sloth Bradypus torquatus
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sloths are arboreal mammals strictly dependent upon forested habitats. The southern part of the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil harbors important forest remnants and the highest genetic diversity known for the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), an endangered species endemic to the Atlantic forest. Large extents of cacao agroforests (cabrucas) connected to forest patches mitigate the effects of fragmentation in this region. We radio-tracked three maned sloths during 40 months in a cabruca at the vicinity of Una Biological Reserve, southern Bahia, and estimated their home range using two commonly employed estimators (minimum convex polygon (MCP) and kernel). Overall cabrucas comprised a significant portion of the home range of the three study animals (MCP: 7-100%) and at least a third of the areas of more intensive use (kernel: 27-99%). The tagged sloths used cabrucas more than expected according to the availability of this habitat in their home range and in the surrounding landscape. In addition to the tagged individuals, maned sloths were observed five times in the study area, twice in cabrucas. Eleven tree species present in cabrucas,me used as food sources by maned sloths. Results indicate that biologically rich cacao agroforests immersed in a landscape still largely composed of native forests, as is the case here, can provide habitat for the maned sloth. This finding spells good news for the conservation of this species, as southern Bahia is one of the most important strongholds for the maned sloth. However, further actions are necessary to protect the species from local extinction, including active management of protected areas, forest fragments, cabrucas and pastures in an integrated, landscape-level manner.

TI  - Earthworms as soil quality indicators in Brazilian no-tillage systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that earthworm populations tend to increase under no-tillage (NT) practices, but abundances tend to be highly variable. In the present study, data from the literature together with those on earthworm populations sampled in six watersheds in SW Parana State, Brazil, were used to build a classification of the biological soil quality of NT systems based on earthworm density and species richness. Earthworms were collected in 34 farms with NT aging from 3 to 27 yr. in February 2010, using an adaptation of the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility) Program method (hand sorting of five 20 cm x 20 cm holes to 20 cm depth). Six forest sites were also sampled in order to compare abundances and species richness with the NT systems. Species richness in the 34 NT sites and in the 6 forests ranged from 1 to 6 species. Most earthworms encountered were exotics belonging to the genus Dichogaster (D. saliens, D. gracilis, D. bolaui and D. affinis) and native Ocnerodrilidae (mainly Belladrilus sp.), all of small individual size. In a few sites, individuals of the Glossoscolecidae (P. corethrurus, Glossoscolex sp., Fimoscolex sp.) and Megascolecidae (Amynthas gracilis) families were also encountered, in low densities. Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae) were found only in the forest fragments. In the NT farms, earthworm abundance ranged from 5 to 605 ind m(-2) and in the forest sites, from 10 to 285 ind m(-2). The ranking of the NT soil biological quality, based on earthworm abundance and species richness was: poor, with <25 individuals per m(-2) and 1 sp.; moderate, with >= 25-100 individuals per m(-2) and 2-3 sp.; good, with >100-200 individuals per m(-2) and 4-5 sp.; excellent, with >200 individuals per m(-2) and >6 sp. About 60% of the 34 farms fell into the poor to moderate categories based on this classification, so further improvements to the NT farm's management system are needed to enhance earthworm populations. Nevertheless, further validation of this ranking system is necessary to allow for its wider-spread use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agronomic Practices to Increase the Yield and Quality of Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.): A Systematic Review
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important legume for human consumption worldwide and an important source of vegetable protein, minerals, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds. The N-2-fixation capacity of this crop reduces its demand for synthetic N fertilizer application to increase yield and quality. Fertilization, yield, and quality of common bean may be optimised by several other agronomic practices such as irrigation, rhizobia application, sowing density, etc. Taking this into consideration, a systematic review integrated with a bibliometric analysis of several agronomic practices that increase common bean yield and quality was conducted, based on the literature published during 1971-2021. A total of 250 publications were found dealing with breeding (n = 61), sowing density and season (n = 14), irrigation (n = 36), fertilization (n = 27), intercropping (n = 12), soilless culture (n = 5), tillage (n = 7), rhizobia application (n = 36), biostimulant/biofertilizer application (n = 21), disease management (n = 15), pest management (n = 2) and weed management (n = 14). The leading research production sites were Asia and South America, whereas from the Australian continent, only four papers were identified as relevant. The keyword co-occurrence network analyses revealed that the main topics addressed in relation to common bean yield in the scientific literature related to that of "pod", "grain", "growth", "cultivar" and "genotype", followed by "soil", "nitrogen", "inoculation", "rhizobia", "environment", and "irrigation". Limited international collaboration among scientists was found, and most reported research was from Brazil. Moreover, there is a complete lack in interdisciplinary interactions. Breeding for increased yield and selection of genotypes adapted to semi-arid environmental conditions combined with the suitable sowing densities are important agronomic practices affecting productivity of common bean. Application of fertilizers and irrigation practices adjusted to the needs of the plants according to the developmental stage and selection of the appropriate tillage system are also of high importance to increase common bean yield and yield qualities. Reducing N-fertilization via improved N-fixation through rhizobia inoculation and/or biostimulants application appeared as a main consideration to optimise crop performance and sustainable management of this crop. Disease and weed management practices appear neglected areas of research attention, including integrated pest management.

TI  - Adsorption and Desorption of arsenate in different soils and gold mining substrates of Minas Gerais State, Brazil
T2  - Journal of Soils and Sediments
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Arsenic (As) availability in natural environment is related to the element's adsorption and desorption processes in soils. Total As is better related to available As in temperate soils than in tropical soils. In tropical soils, total As is not very significant in terms of availability, therefore justifying the necessity for studies into As dynamics. Knowledge of As dynamics in soil as well as development of new analytical methodologies involving tropical soils are insufficient and necessary for future mitigation projects. Objective. The objectives of this study were: (1) To adjust methodologies which may assist in understanding arsenate dynamics in tropical soils and substrates; (2) To evaluate the adsorption and desorption of arsenate in soils and substrate samples, and to find a minimum value of arsenate available in soil which is lethal to sorghum plants. Material and Methods. Samples of three soils from Minas Gerais State (YL, RYL, and CS) and two sulfide substrates of gold mining (B1 and B2) were used in the assays. All the material was physically and chemically characterized. Remaining As (As-rem) and remaining P (P-rem) of each material, along with MACP and MACAs (using the Langmuir isotherms), were obtained. After agitation to obtain MACP and MACAs, arsenate was extracted by anionic resin and Mehlich-III to evaluate arsenate desorption of the material retained on the filter paper. Subsequently, arsenate desorption curves for the different materials were obtained, and arsenate availability was determined through a bioassay with sorghum plants. Samples of soils and substrate B1 were incubated with six levels of As doses. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 30 days. The plants were then harvested, dried and weighed. Available As in the soils and substrate was determined by Mehlich-III. Results and Discussions. As-rem level decreased from YL (sandy) to RYL (clayey) soil samples, which always showed lower values than P-rem. Among the soils and substrates evaluated, RYL showed the highest MACAs and MACP followed by CS, YL and B1. The results were in accordance with the values observed for As-rem and P-rem and confirm the idea that the ability of the assayed materials to remove As from the soil/substrate solution is higher than the ability to remove P. On the other hand, the binding energy (a) between soil/substrate and As is weaker than the binding energy of P. Given the fact that the studied soils present a real ability to remove As from the solution, only a small part of As would be unavailable considering MACAs as a reference. As-Mehlich-III values were higher than As-resin for substrate B1. Mehlich-III seemed to be more appropriate to extract labile forms of arsenate in substrate B1 as well as in the soils. Available As by Mehlich-III (26.9 mg/dm3) was considered a reference of As LCL to sorghum plants. CC50 was sensitive to the buffering capacity of each soil, showing values varying from 1.34 mg/dm3 As (clay soil with lower As-rem) to 12.31 mg/dm3 As (sandy soil with higher As-rem). Conclusions. The adaptation of the As-rem and MACAs methodologies was satisfactory and of great value in the study of adsorption, desorption and As availability for soils and mining substrate. Mehlich-III was also satisfactory to estimate available As and was sensitive to soil buffering capacity. Nevertheless, resin can also be used as an alternative. MACAs varied among soils and was higher than MACP. However, As showed higher lability than P. Using Mehlich-III, we determined the value corresponding to CC50 that showed a good reference of toxicity to available As. Outlook. The environmental implications of the As behavior are quite serious. Beside the fact that arsenate is removed very fast from the soil solution, an anthropogenic input of the element, being part of the soil quantity factor, may remain in a reversible form for a long time. As may therefore return to the soil solution and becomes available to plants, animals and the entire environment. Considering that CC50 is the maximum contents of available As the environment can tolerate to allow some vegetal biomass production, the maximum capacity of As immobilization in each soil is reduced when compared to the soils' MACAs values. Therefore, the maximum and safe values of reference to be used in the evaluation of incidental discharge of the element in soils must be reduced.

TI  - Phytodesalination and chemical and organic conditioners to recover the chemical properties of saline-sodic soil
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid regions' soils have been degraded by salinization. The use of chemical conditioners makes this management very expensive. As an alternative, organic conditioners can be used with plants adapted to the salts and phytoremediation, such as Atriplex nummularia Lindl. This study aimed to evaluate the use of phytoremediation and chemical and organic conditioners in the recovery of chemical attributes of a saline-sodic soil in Brazil Northeast. A study was carried out by testing A. nummularia with the application of chemical (gypsum and anionic polymer) and organic conditioners (bovine and sheep manure), and a control treatment. The experiment was conducted for 18 mo with soil sampling at 6, 12, and 18 mo. The treatments did not modify pH but were effective in reducing the electrical conductivity. All treatments reduced the sodium adsorption ratio and the exchangeable sodium percentage. The use of A. nummularia and organic conditioners were as efficient as the use of chemical conditioners to improve soil chemical attributes, suggesting the use of these techniques in the management of soil degradation by salinization. Our study also suggests that local seasonal patterns and physical characteristics of soils influence the effectiveness of Atriplex and conditioners on the extraction and dynamics of salts. Phytoremediation may be complementary to the use of organic conditioners produced on the farm, making management more sustainable.

AB  - Jakarta as a home for more than 10 millions habitant facing complex environmental problems due to physical development that cause physical deformation. Physical deformation issues such as decreasing environmental carrying capacity, land cover changes and land subsidence have occurred. Recent studies shows that the long of shoreline changes in a span of 13 years from 2002 to 2015 around 14 km due to land reclamation in Jakarta bay. Previous studies also concluded that Jakarta suffer a sinking phenomena due to its rapid subsidence rate, approximately 260 mm/year in northern part of Jakarta. During the 2007 to 2011, the land subsidence phenomena in Jakarta was observed by InSAR based on ALOS-PALSAR data and found that the subsided areas only occurred in certain areas, mainly in Pluit and Cengkareng regions, with a subsidence of approximately 70 cm for 4 years. Land subsidence is generally related to geological subsidence i.e. sediment consolidation due to its own weight and tectonic movements; or related to human activities such as withdrawal of ground water and geothermal fluid, oil and gas extraction from underground reservoirs, and collapse of underground mines. The amount of subsidence or uplift can be estimated from the number of concentric fringes that appear in the interferogram. This research utilizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data observed from ALOS-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band) satellites. By interfering two single look complex (SLC) images from different observation epoch, it is found that the subsided area that has been identified before continues to subside. This occurs especially in Pluit region and has been revealed by interfering ALOS-2 data up to year 2016. The deformation in this area is approximately 12 cm from November 2015 to September 2016. The process of land reclamation also clearly identified by Sentinel-1 image by series data processing in Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) software.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses of Gallesia integrifolia (Spreng.) Harms and Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi seedlings in dense shade
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the growth and photosynthetic behavior of Gallesia integrifolia ('pau-d'alho') and Schinus terebinthifolius ('aroeirinha') under shade, seeking to obtain ecophysiological information for introducing seedlings of those species in previously established cacao agroforestry systems. Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR). The mean values of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P (nmax)) in 25 and 5% daylight were 12.8 and 8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for G. integrifolia and 17.9 and 7.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for S. terebinthifolius. Based on the measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density and estimated values of photosynthetic saturated irradiance (Is) we concluded that, in all shaded conditions, the leaves of both species were under sub optimal light conditions to reach P (nmax). In spite of the lowest P (nmax) values, RGR and NAR were significantly higher for G. integrifolia in all irradiance levels. Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of human-orangutan conflict mitigation strategies in Sumatra
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Crop raiding by great apes is an emerging conservation issue across their range. It is important because it involves highly threatened species that can cause significant economic damage and be killed in retribution. Yet, to date, no quantitative study has sought to test possible solutions for preventing this form of humanwildlife conflict.2. From February 2007 to August 2009, we monitored crop-raiding patterns across a Sumatran agroforest landscape to determine background levels of human-orangutan conflict. We also intensively monitored a subset of 50 farms to assess changes in farmer attitudes towards orangutan management; differences between farmer reported and independently enumerated monetary loss from crop raiding; and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in reducing orangutan crop raiding on 35 treatment farms (25 trialling noise deterrents and 10 trialling tree nets) in comparison with 15 control farms over a pre-trial (12 month) and a trial (18 month) phase. Five months after the trials had ended, the ongoing use or uptake of the techniques were assessed.3. Across the wider landscape, background levels of mean daily orangutan crop-raiding incidents per month (+/- SE) farms did not significantly differ between the pre-trial (9.1 +/- 3.7) and trial (7.1 +/- 4.3) phases, whilst on the 35 treatment farms it reduced significantly. Furthermore, crop yield increased (+ 60 8%) on the netted trial trees, but reduced (-27.4%) on the control farm trees. Despite this, there was no subsequent use of this technique, unlike those farmers (40%) who continued using the less-effective noise deterrents.4. Farmer participation in the project yielded unexpected and positive attitude changes, from preferring orangutan removal (pre-trial) to in situ management with crop protection measures (posttrial). However, project participation may have increased farmer expectations of receiving compensation because the treatment farmers consistently overestimated their crop losses, unlike the control farmers who did not.5. Synthesis and applications. Whilst human-orangutan conflicts caused substantial losses to local livelihoods, the identification of an effective mitigation method (nets) neither guaranteed its continued use nor uptake. Developing easy to install nets for valuable tree crops is therefore recommended. Nevertheless, the project intervention efforts did create benign farmer attitudes towards orangutan management, an essential prerequisite for managing large-bodied mammals in conflict with people.

TI  - Biochars from agro-industrial residues of the Amazon: an ecological alternative to enhance the use of phosphorus in agriculture
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of the world population requires greater agricultural production, which consequently increases the demand for phosphorus-based (P-based) compounds and the generation of agro-industrial residues. Biochar is an effective alternative for the recovery and reuse of P-based species, as well to mitigate the generation of environmental liabilities and provide adequate disposal for agro-industrial residues. This study investigates the phosphate adsorption capacity of biochars produced with residues of alai seeds (BA), Brazil nut shell (BN) and palm kernel cake (BK) and the relationship with their chemical constituents. Biochars were produced at 700 degrees C to evaluate the physicochemical properties, elemental composition, contact time and influence of pH on phosphate adsorption. The solid/liquid contact time varied froml to 24 h and the adsorption of phosphorus species on biochar was strongly pH dependent (p < 0.05) between the biochars (BN> BA > BK). The Langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorption process (R-2 >= 0.90) and showed high efficiency in phosphate removal in aqueous solution (BA: 92.34; BN: 123.55 and BK: 79.46 mg g(-1)). The heterogeneity of mineral constituents was emphasized by principal component analysis and indicated that phosphate adsorption on biochars is highly and directly associated with carbon (C) content, cation exchange capacity and pH and inversely related to nitrogen (N) content, yield, point of zero charge, (O + N)/C and ash content. Therefore, these biochars constitute promising materials for phosphate adsorption and present potential to be applied to soil as a source of P in the form of biofertilizer.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Differentiation in Plathymenia reticulata Benth.: A Comparative Study of Forest and Cocoa Agroforest Systems in the Atlantic Forest Domain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests, housing about two-thirds of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, face significant deforestation and fragmentation, leading to the loss of over half their area. Conservation and restoration efforts are crucial, especially for regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which suffers with a reduction in biomass and species diversity. The Brazilian agroforest system, typical from the region of Southern Bahia called "cabruca", are helping to mitigate these effects by combining cocoa cultivation with forest management, enhancing both socio-economic and environmental benefits. In a study focusing on Plathymenia reticulata, a tree species native to the Atlantic Forest, we evaluated the effectiveness of the cabruca agroforest system versus the natural forest for maintaining genetic diversity and landscape connectivity. Results showed that cabruca systems, while managed, exhibit a level of genetic diversity compared to natural forests. However, forest populations remain critical for their genetic reservoirs and adaptability. The cabrucas agroforest system also showed higher inbreeding levels, emphasizing the need for effective management to reduce inbreeding risks.

TI  - Grasses and legumes as cover crop in no-tillage system in northeastern Para Brazil
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies to select one or more species of coverage plants adapted to Amazonian soil and climate conditions of the Amazon are a promising strategy for the improvement of environmental quality, establishing no-till agricultural systems, and thereby reducing the impacts of monoculture farming. The aim of this study was to assess the persistence time, half-life time, macronutrient content and accumulation, and C:N ratio of straw coverage in a Ultisol in northeastern Para. Experimental design was randomized blocks with five treatments and five replicates. Plants were harvested after 105 days, growth and biomass production was quantified. After 84 days, soil coverage was 97, 85, 52, 50, and 15% for signalgrass (Brachiaria brizantha) (syn. Urochloa), dense crowngrass (Panicum purpurascens), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformes), pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea,), respectively. Signalgrass yielded the greatest dry matter production (9,696 kg ha(-1)). It also had high C:N ratio (38.4), long half-life (86.5 days) and a high persistence in the field. Jack bean also showed high dry matter production (8,950 kg ha(-1)), but it had low C:N ratio (17.4) and lower half-life time (39 days) than the grasses. These attributes indicate that signalgrass and jack bean have a high potential for use as cover plants in no-till agricultural systems in the State of Para.

TI  - Managing Human-Sun Bear Conflict in Sumatran Agroforest Systems
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-wildlife conflict negatively affects farmers' livelihoods and wildlife species that may already be threatened. In Sumatra, the sun bear Helarctos malayanus is a little-known and potentially significant conflict species. To understand the characteristics of human-sun bear conflict and local perceptions and tolerance towards the species, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 120 farmers from four study areas in west-central Sumatra. Spatio-temporal conflict patterns were then investigated in 30 farms from one selected study area. Overall, 45.8 % of respondents reported having experienced human-sun bear conflicts since occupying their farm and crop raiding characterised the majority of these conflicts. Farmers who experienced property damage and livestock depredation by sun bears were less tolerant towards the species and favoured conflict management strategies that removed sun bears from their area. Conflict events were positively correlated with rainfall and peaked when important cash crops reached maturity. With the current rate of agricultural expansion in west-central Sumatra human-sun bear conflicts are likely to increase. This study suggests that mitigation strategies should be implemented as crops mature for harvest, where such measures would no doubt lessen raids by other conflict species.

T2  - LEUCAENA - ADAPTATION, QUALITY AND FARMING SYSTEMS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Leucaena - Adaptation, Quality and Farming Systems
CL  - HANOI, VIETNAM
AB  - Growth of 25 accessions of Leucaena was assessed in 61 'environments' at 19 sites over a 2.5-year period to identify agronomic adaptation to environmental challenges. From analysis of variance, accessions, 'environments' and accession x environment interaction accounted for 14% 48% and 26% of the variation respectively. The large environment component of variance reflected the diversity of test environments, from non-limiting to severely limiting. Genotype x environment analysis techniques were used to identify broad and specific adaptation to environmental limitations. The FI hybrid accession L. pallida K748 x L. leucocephala K636 was comparatively very high yielding in all environments, and displayed excellent broad adaptation. Other accessions which displayed broad adaptation but at lower yield levels included L. pallida CQ3439 and L. pallida K376 x L. leucocephala K8 F5 hybrid. L. trichandra OFI 53/88 displayed specific adaptation to low temperatures in highland tropical environments. No accessions were specifically adapted to strongly acid-infertile soils or to low rainfall. Correlations between dry matter production and six environmental variables attempted to identify the major factors limiting growth of the Leucaena genus. Highly significant correlations were found for soil acidity, minimum temperature and psyllid pressure, and of these soil acidity most affected growth.

TI  - Biochar enhances Acrisol attributes and yield of bean in Brazilian tropical dry region
T2  - ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar is a product rich in carbon, which improve the soil attributes and crop yield. In the Brazilian tropical dry region, common bean is cultivated under rainfed, in poor, acidic, and with low water retention soils. This work aims to evaluate the effect of biochar on soil physical and chemical attributes, on evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), and on bean yield. The field experiment was conducted over four biochar rates (B0: no biochar; B10: biochar at 10 t ha(-1); B20: 20 t ha(-1) and B40: 40 t ha(-1)), and three replications. Our analysis revealed that different rates of biochar do not affect the soil physical attributes due to a mismatch between soil texture and the particle size of biochar. Treatments with biochar promoted an increase in soil pH, P content, cation exchange capacity, reduced the Al+H content, which caused an increase in bean yield and consequently WUE. Our findings expand our knowledge about the effect of the biochar applied to the Acrisols on decreasing the soil acidity and to increase the yield and WUE, and add important information that can be suitable for development of strategy to mitigate problems caused by instability of rains and poor fertility soils.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of Eucalyptus plantations and management on water resources at plot and catchment scales
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to quantify the effects of forest plantation and management (clear cut or 30% partial harvest) in relation to pasture, on catchment discharge in southeast Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. A paired-catchment approach was implemented in two regions (Eldorado do Sul and Sao Gabriel municipalities) where discharge was measured for 4 years at three catchments in each region, two of which were predominantly eucalypt plantation (mainly Eucalyptus saligna, rotation of approximately 7-9 years) with native forest and grass in streamside zones. The third catchment was covered with grazed pasture. Weather, soils, canopy interception, groundwater level, tree growth, and leaf area index were also measured. The 3-PG process-based forest productivity model was adapted to predict spatial daily plantation and pasture water balance including precipitation interception, soil evaporation, transpiration, soil moisture, drainage, discharge, and monthly plantation growth. The TOPMODEL framework was used to simulate water pools and fluxes in the catchments. Discharge was higher under pasture than pre-harvesting plantation and increased for 1-2 years after complete plantation harvest; this change was less pronounced in the catchments under partial harvest. The ratio of discharge to precipitation before harvesting varied from 7% to 13% in the eucalypt catchments and 28% to 29% under pasture. The ratio increases to 23-24% after total harvest, and to 17% after partial harvesting. The ratio under pasture also increases during this period (to 32-44%) owing to increased precipitation. The baseflow, in relation to total discharge, varied from 28% to 62% under Eucalyptus and from 38% to 43% in the pasture catchments. Hence, eucalypt plantations in these regions can be expected to influence discharge regimes when compared with pasture land use, and modelling suggests that partial harvesting would moderate the magnitude of discharge variation compared with a full catchment plantation harvesting. The model efficiency coefficient (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient) varied from 0.665 to 0.799 for the total period of the study. Simulation of alternative harvesting scenarios suggested that at least 20% of the catchment planted area must be harvested to increase discharge. This model could be a useful practical tool in various plantation forestry contexts around the world. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Charcoal injection in blast furnaces (Bio-PCI): CO2 reduction potential and economic prospects
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
M3  - Article
AB  - The steel industry is under pressure to reduce its CO2 emissions, which arise from the use of coal. In the long-term, the injection of pulverized particles of charcoal from biomass through blast furnace tuyeres, in this case called Bio-PCI, is an attractive method from both an environmental and metallurgical viewpoint. The potential of Bio-PCI has been assessed in terms of its CO2 abatement potential and economic viewpoint. A cost objective function has been used to measure the impact of biochar substitution in highly fuel-efficient BF among the top nine hot metal producers; estimations are based on the relevant cost determinants of ironmaking. This contribution aims to shed light on two strategic questions: Under what conditions is the implementation of Bio-PCI economically attractive? Additionally, where is such a techno-economic innovation likely to be taken up the earliest? The results indicate the potential for an 18-40% mitigation of CO2. Findings from the economic assessment show that biochar cannot compete with fossil coal on price alone; therefore, a lower cost of biochar or the introduction of carbon taxes will be necessary to increase the competitiveness of Bio-PCI. Based on the current prices of raw materials, electricity and carbon taxes, biochar should be between 130.1 and 236.4 USD/t and carbon taxes should be between 47.1 and 198.7 USD/t CO2 to facilitate the substitution of Bio-PCI in the examined countries. In regard to implementation, Brazil, followed by India, China and the USA appeared to be in a better position to deploy Bio-PCI. (C) 2014 Brazilian Metallurgical, Materials and Mining Association.

TI  - Mapping pasture management in the Brazilian Amazon from dense Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of cattle ranching has the potential to reduce deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by decreasing the demand for new agricultural land. Explicit spatial knowledge on where, when and how pastures are managed and intensification takes place is needed to better estimate potentials of more sustainable management. Monitoring the frequency of management practices like burning of pasture land and tillage treatment with adequate spatial resolution therefore offers novel indicators for describing land use intensity. With dense time series of Landsat data, it appears possible to quantify land use intensity also in heterogeneous landscapes where fine-scale processes cannot be monitored with previously available datasets.Our overarching goal is to describe the occurrence or absence of extensive or intensive management regimes over time. For this study, we focused on detecting fire and tillage events in the region of Novo Progresso, Para, Brazil, where deforested land is mostly used for cattle ranching by both largeholders and smallholders. We used a dense time series of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to mitigate the problem of varying cloud cover. For each acquisition date, we extracted a temporal sequence of three subsequent clear observations at pixel level. The temporal variation in each clear observation sequence was characterized by a stack of spectral and temporal features. These feature stacks were classified with a random forest to identify the management events. We aggregated the classification results based on the random forest class probabilities and derived normalized annual class scores for land management events. The yielded class score maps show burned and tilled areas on a yearly basis and provide a measure of model confidence.We detected burned pastures with area adjusted user accuracies of 80-98%, burned secondary regrowth with 63-80% and tilled pastures with 74-78%. Our approach was able to discriminate management events even when they succeeded very fast. This way, the mapping approach with clear observation sequences allows us to contextualize management events directly from dense time series of high resolution satellite data. This opens new pathways to disentangle how management practices between smallholders and agribusinesses vary in the Brazilian Amazon. With sensor constellations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat data becoming a unified source for much denser time series soon, our method bears great potential to better understand and map pasture dynamics in the Amazon.

TI  - Biochar Increases Diuron Sorption and Reduces the Potential Contamination of Subsurface Water with Diuron in a Sandy Soil
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - yy The herbicide diuron is widely used in agricultural areas in Brazil, whereas it has high potential for subsurface water contamination due to its physicochemical characteristics. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of biochar as a sorbent and possible pesticide leaching mitigation. The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of biochar application on the kinetics of sorption and desorption of diuron in a Cerrado Haplic Plinthosol. Samples were collected in an experiment conducted in the field in a randomized block design consisting of the combination of two levels of fertilizer application (0 and 300 kg ha(-1) of 5-25-15 formula of NPK fertilizers) and three doses of biochar (0, 16, and 32 Mg ha(-1)). The Freundlich isotherm accurately described the sorption of diuron in all treatments. Biochar application increased the sorption and reduced the desorption of diuron. This effect was attributed to the contribution of biochar to total organic carbon (C) and C in the humin fraction and to the increase in the reactivity of the humic acid and humin fractions, which was significantly highly correlated with the sorption coefficient (K-f). A positive correlation between the partition coefficient of organic C and K-f confirmed the importance of the soil organic compartment for the sorption of diuron. The higher diuron sorption and lower diuron desorption capacities of sandy soils after biochar application could reduce the potential risk of diuron leaching and contamination of subsurface water.

Communities of solitary wasps and bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) play a key role in agroecosystem functioning and they have been used in studies of biodiversity assessment in different land-use types. We aimed to assess patterns of species richness and composition of solitary wasps and bees over a 1-yr period in a gradient of decreasing land-use intensity formed by pastures, alley croppings, young fallows, and old fallows using trap nests. Old fallows had the highest species richness of wasps and bees, harboring all bee species and 86 percent of wasp species occurring in the region, while the remaining land-uses had similar species richness. Vegetation structure (tree richness) and relative humidity explained most of the variance for the species richness of wasps. For bees, however, there was no influence of environmental factors on the community among land-use types, indicating better adaptability of this group to environmental variations related to land-use. The composition of solitary wasp communities (but not those of bees) differed among land-use types, and the occurrence of rare species in most cases was restricted to old fallow sites. In conclusion, the community of solitary wasps and bees is contingent on land-use, with solitary wasps more sensitive to anthropized areas. For both groups, less anthropized areas harbor a greater richness and number of rare species while more intensively managed land-use types harbor higher abundances.

TI  - Heavy metals in hair of small mammals from the cacao agroforestry and Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42  16.42; Ni - 5.31  4.3; Mn 1.64  2.63; Cu - 1.13  1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28  14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34  0.40; Cu - 1  2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66  18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44  9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived.

TI  - Biochar-soil-plant interfaces: a systematic review of the crop performance in tropical climate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biochar is increasingly being assessed as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by tropical soils, as it can help mitigate land degradation, replenish nutrients, and enhance soil structure, increasing fertility and promoting the development of crops. This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 degrees C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected-in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services.

TI  - Assessment of Suitability of Tree Species for Bioenergy Production on Burned and Degraded Peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of deforested and degraded land, particularly degraded peatlands, need a viable long-term solution for restoration, ideally one that ensures energy security without compromising food security or biodiversity conversation. To address a knowledge gap on the most adaptive bioenergy crop(s) for degraded lands, this research project assessed the survival and growth performance of potential bioenergy crops to restore burned and degraded peatlands. Our methodology compared the bioenergy species with the potential to survive in extreme environments, i.e., gamal [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], kaliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner), kemiri sunan [Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) Airy Shaw], and nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). Observed parameters are plant survival rates, tree height, and circular stem growth. The experiment was conducted between March 2016 to February 2017 in a two-hectare demonstration plot on burned and degraded peatland in Buntoi village, Pulang Pisau, Central Kalimantan province. Using a split plot design, two treatments were given to each species, i.e., monoculture plantation and agroforestry (intercropped with Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.); with each treatment, the species were replicated on two separate plots. Results indicate that nyamplung is the most adoptable species followed by kemiri sunan, however both species performed very well under agroforestry treatment when compared with monoculture. Further study is needed to assess the productivity and associate biofuel yield.

TI  - THE CONTROL OF LEISHMANIASES
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human leishmaniases are caused by at least 13 different species and subspecies [L. donovani donovani, L. d. infantum, L. d. chagasi, L. tropica, L. major, L. aethiopica, L. braziliensis guyanensis, L. b. panamensis, L. mexicana mexicana, L. m. amazonensis, L. m. pifanoi, L. peruviana, L. garnhami] of parasite of Leishmania. These parasites are transmitted to man from other infected persons or mammals by sandflies when taking a blood meal. Leishmaniases have been reported from about 80 countries and probably some 400,000 new cases occur each year. Clinically the leishmaniases can be divided into 3 major groups: visceral leishmaniases, which are usually fatal if untreated; cutaneous leishmaniases, which often produce permanent facial disfigurement; and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis of the New World, which produces severe mutilation by destruction of the naso-oro-pharyngeal cavity and somtimes death. Since the various forms of leishmaniasis differ substantially from each other in their epidemiology, the stategy for control must be adapted to the local situation in each endemic area, after thorough ecological and epidemiological studies of the vectors, host and the landscape. If insufficient baseline information is available, failure of haphazardly applied control measures can be expected. Peridomestic insecticide spraying together with treatment of patients is effective in certain foci of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, urban visceral leishmaniasis and uta. Extensive programs to eradicate desert rodents, combined with land reclamation, resulted in a considerable decrease in the incidence of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in vast areas of the USSR. Since control of zoonotic cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis of the New World is hardly feasible at present, the only rational approach to prevent some of the mucosal lesions is early diagnosis and radical treatment of patients with the rather unsatisfactory drugs presently available.

TI  - Artificial regeneration in gaps and skidding trails after mechanised forest exploitation in Acre, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural regeneration of some desirable species under exploitation pressure in Amazon is often very poor or non-existent. The traditional techniques of enrichment planting have presented low performance of the planted seedlings and high costs for its implementation. This study analyzes the first 5 years of growth and survival of five tropical tree species (Bertholletia excelsa, Ceiba pentandra, Torresia acreana, Swietenia macrophylkla and Cedrela fissilis) planted in skidding trails and exploitation gaps. The basic planting technique consisted in using the cleared areas after forest harvesting for the establishment of seedlings of species ecologically adapted to the gap environment. The study was carried out in the EMBRAPA-CPAF-ACRE (Agroforestry Research Centre of Acre) in Acre State in West Amazon. The diameter increment varied from 0.30 cm year(-1) for Bertholletia to 0.52 cm year(-1) for Swietenia and Torresia. After 5 years the height growth was similar for all species around 3.0 m. In the first year Bertholletia presented a high mortality, around 80%, caused by severe predation by rodents. Ceiba also presented a high mortality after the second year of planting probably due the canopy closure. The best survival percentage was presented by Torresia, over 90%. The Meliaceae (Swietenia and Cedrela) species had a similar survival, around 70 to 75%. The Hypsipyla grandella attack was more severe in Cedrela than in Swietenia, but in both cases (9.37 and 31% after 7 and 5 years respectively for Swietenia and Cedrela) was still low when compared with other enrichment plantings.

TI  - Malaria in the State of Amazonas: a typical Brazilian tropical disease influenced by waves of economic development
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
M3  - Review
AB  - In Brazil, more than 99% of malaria cases are reported in the Amazon, and the State of Amazonas accounts for 40% of this total. However, the accumulated experience and challenges in controlling malaria in this region in recent decades have not been reported. Throughout the first economic cycle during the rubber boom (1879 to 1912), malaria was recorded in the entire state, with the highest incidence in the villages near the Madeira River in the Southern part of the State of Amazonas. In the 1970s, during the second economic development cycle, the economy turned to the industrial sector and demanded a large labor force, resulting in a large migratory influx to the capital Manaus. Over time, a gradual increase in malaria transmission was observed in peri-urban areas. In the 1990s, the stimulation of agroforestry, particularly fish farming, led to the formation of permanent Anopheline breeding sites and increased malaria in settlements. The estimation of environmental impacts and the planning of measures to mitigate them, as seen in the construction of the Coari-Manaus gas pipeline, proved effective. Considering the changes occurred since the Amsterdam Conference in 1992, disease control has been based on early diagnosis and treatment, but the development of parasites that are resistant to major antimalarial drugs in Brazilian Amazon has posed a new challenge. Despite the decreased lethality and the gradual decrease in the number of malaria cases, disease elimination, which should be associated with government programs for economic development in the region, continues to be a challenge.

TI  - Does grass-legume intercropping change soil quality and grain yield in integrated crop-livestock systems?
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In sustainable tropical agriculture, grass-legume intercropping can increase productivity, enhance the nutritional quality of the crop and affect soil microbiological activity, leading to higher yields in succession crops. This study evaluated the impact of grass-legume intercropping, during the pasture phase of integrated crop-livestock systems under no-tillage (ICLS-NT), on soil microbiota, pasture quality, and soybean productivity in the Brazilian Cerrado. We evaluated the effect of intercropping on total soil contents of organic carbon and nitrogen, soil microbial activity, animal and soybean productivity (2017 and 2018 crop seasons), and pasture production and quality. The experiment consisted of twelve treatments under grass-legume intercropping in the pasture phase of ICLS-NT. The grasses Urochloa ruziziensis 'Kennedy', U. brizantha 'Paiagu ' as', Panicum maximum 'Tamani' and U. brizantha 'Piata similar to' were grown in monoculture and intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) 'Tumucumaque' or pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 'Mandarin'. A randomized block design, with three repetitions, was used in a split-plot arrangement, considering the grasses as plots and the legumes as subplots. The results showed that ICLS-NT improved the activity of soil microbial biomass when compared to monoculture systems. Grass-legume intercropping during the pasture phase, mainly with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), increased soybean productivity, and grass dry matter. Total organic carbon (TOC), carbon management index (CMI%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil basal respiration (BR), and metabolic quotient (Qmic) are the most sensitive markers when it comes to the effects of intercropping on soil microbiological activity and soybean productivity in ICLS-NT. Identifying the best grass-legume combinations allows the establishment of more productive crop-livestock integration systems under no-tillage better adapted to the bio-edaphoclimatic conditions of the Brazilian Cerrado.

TI  - Impact of agricultural practices on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for South African sugarcane production
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental footprint of agricultural production can vary significantly both between countries and within a country based on regional conditions and agricultural practices. A life cycle assessment approach was used to model primary fossil fuel energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of sugarcane in South Africa. Results were calculated for sugarcane produced in two distinct regions, the irrigated North and the non-irrigated North Coast. Regional differences also include terrain, soil, and use of mechanization. Models were adapted to estimate the impacts of burning prior to harvest, leaving a biomass mulch blanket with green cane harvesting, and increasing the level of mechanization for harvest and other field operations. Irrigation contributes to a higher energy input in the irrigated North but differences are mitigated by the lower fertilizer, agro-chemical, and diesel use per ton of sugarcane produced there. Despite higher energy inputs in the irrigated North, greenhouse gas emissions are similar for sugarcane produced in each region. Green cane harvesting reduces energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions by 4% and 16%, respectively, in both regions. Impacts of mechanization on soil compaction and stool damage result in lower yields and proportionally higher energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions. Results demonstrate the potential for variability in LCA results based on regional differences in production practices within a country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - COFFEE WATER USE IN AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM WITH RUBBER TREES
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water uptake and use by plants are essentially energy processes that can be largely modified by percentage of soil cover, plant type; foliage area and its distribution; phenological stage and several environmental factors. Coffee trees (Coffea arabica - cv. Obata IAC 1669-20) in Agrforestry System (AFS) spaced 3.4x0.9m apart, were planted inside and along rows of 12- year-old rubber trees (Hevea spp.) in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil (22 42'30 '' S, 47 38'00 '' W - altitude: 546m). Sap flow of one-year-old coffee plants exposed to 35; 45; 80; 95 and 100% of total solar radiation was estimated by the heat balance technique (Dynamax Inc.). Coffee plants under shade showed greater water loss per unit of incident irradiance. On the other hand, plants in monocrop (full sun) had the least water loss per unit of incident irradiance. For the evaluated positions average water use was (gH2O.m(-2)Leaf area. MJ(-1)): 64.71; 67.75; 25.89; 33.54; 27.11 in Dec./2002 and 97.14; 72.50; 40.70; 32.78; 26.13 in Feb./2003. This fact may be attributed to the higher stomata sensitivity of the coffee plants under more illuminated conditions, thus plants under full sun presented the highest water use efficiency. Express transpiration by leaf mass can be a means to access plant adaptation to the various environments, which is inaccessible when the approach is made by leaf area.

TI  - Effects of habitat management on different feeding guilds of herbivorous insects in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human pressure on natural habitats increases the importance of agroforests for biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest, a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m(2) were established, and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap. The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior of Psyllids and absence of natural enemies enable their diversity to increase when they are adapted to a new host. We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees.

TI  - Estimation of sediments produced in a subbasin using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
T2  - CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the parameters considered by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the soil cover and management factor (C) is the main human influenced factor affecting the estimation of water erosion, and one of the most sensitive to spatiotemporal variations. Consequently, this study aims to compare the efficiency of C factor estimates obtained from the literature for each land-use class (C-lit) and by calculation based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (C-NDVI). We test the hypothesis that soil loss estimates based on C-NDVI approach are more accurate than those based on C-lit. Water erosion was estimated based on soil morphological, physical, and chemical properties in addition to climate, relief, management practices, and land use and cover. The modeling steps were realized with the help of the Geographic Information System. The results were validated using the data of total sediment transported with water discharge and daily runoff. RUSLE underestimated soil losses by 0.64 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) using C-lit and 0.45 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) with C-NDVI, which corresponds to errors of 21.05% and 14.80%, respectively. Therefore, the C-NDVI factor results are more accurate. Both methodologies identified areas with high erosion rates where the adoption of mitigation measures should be prioritized.

TI  - Siltation rate and main anthropic impacts on sedimentation of the Sao Luis tidal inlet - State of Maranhao, Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, intense human intervention in the coastal zone has given rise to severe siltation and erosion problems. This scenario is located the Sao Luis tidal inlet, formed by the mouths of the Anil and Bacanga rivers which due to various kinds of interference have been changing their sediment transport and deposition processes. With these changes in mind, this study sought to evaluate the evolution of the siltation and sedimentation rates in this area, as well as the main anthropogenic influences associated with this process. The methodology consisted in verifying the morphological evolution on the basis of the scanning and vectorization of nautical charts of 1947 and 1966, bathymetric surveys conducted in 2006, and aerial photos dating from 2011. The results show a silting up process coincident with interventions that occurred in the Anil and Bacanga river basins, with a volume of silt estimated at 8.5x106 m(3), over the period from 1944 to 2011 (64 years), at a rate of 1.6 cm. yr(-1). These processes are associated mainly with the construction of the Bacanga dam and land reclamation projects undertaken for the purpose of providing new areas for urban expansion. The evaluation of the results showed intense and advanced silting up of the Sao Luis tidal inlet, at rates proportionally greater than those of other estuaries, calling for corrective actions and the implementation of coastal management policies for this area.

TI  - Growth of yellow passion-fruit seedlings in different substrates under salt stress
T2  - WATER RESOURCES AND IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT-WRIM
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt stress can negatively affect the development of seedlings. However, the use of alternative substrates can mitigate these effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the growth of yellow passion-fruit seedlings in response to irrigation with saline water grown on different substrates. The experiment was developed at the University of International Integration of AfroBrazilian Lusofonia, Redencao, Ceara, Brazil. The experimental design was entirely randomized, in a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement, composed of two levels of electrical conductivity of the irrigation water (0.3 and 3.0 dS m-1) and five substrate types (S1 = soil; S2 = sand, sandy soil, and bovine manure - 1:1:1; S3 = sand, sandy soil, and carbonized rice husk - 1:1:1; S4 = sand, sandy soil, and biochar - 1:1:1; S5 = sand, sandy soil, and vegetal ash - 1:1:1), with five replications. The S2 substrate containing sand, sandy soil, and bovine manure promoted higher performance of seedling height, stem diameter, shoot dry mass, root dry mass, and total dry mass associated with low salinity water. The S2 substrate was more efficient for leaf area, while S4 substrate was more efficient for number of leaves, root length, and pH. The S1 and S2 substrates presented higher electrical conductivity of the saturation extract using water of higher conductivity.

TI  - The Rapid and Participatory Assessment of Land Suitability in Development Cooperation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development cooperation in agriculture aims to contribute to the achieving of a large part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN 2030 Agenda, especially the first three, No Poverty (1), Zero Hunger (2), and Good Health and Well-being (3). Development cooperation in agriculture tries to help local communities to increase their awareness, participation, and skills about the management of land and environmental resources, in order to realize sustainable development. In this context, methods of participatory assessment of land suitability have been widely and successfully applied. The present research took place in the framework of a real development cooperation intervention in Nord Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo) and aimed to implement a rapid participatory assessment of land suitability. In this context, where official and detailed data are not available, the study fostered the active involvement of local experts and used geographical information systems (GIS) to identify the most suitable crops to be supported in different zones of the study area. Toward this aim, the authors used a procedure based on the following steps: the identification of relevant land use types (LUTs), mapping capability factors, describing the responses of each LUT to the different capability factors, mapping potential land suitability for the LUTs, mapping accessibility, mapping land suitability for the LUTs. Resulting maps and tables were used to identify the most suitable areas for the different uses. Globally, forestry was the most suited use (99.6% of the study area is potentially highly suitable), followed by the cropping of manioc, sorghum, banana, oil palm, bean and cattle grazing in decreasing order (62.6% of the study area is potentially highly suitable for grazing). When accessibility is considered, forestry presents the largest decrease in the class of high potential suitability (-34.9% equal to a loss of 24,945.5 ha), while less adaptable uses, such as cattle grazing showed lower decreases in highly suitable class (-11.2%) and larger increases in scarcely suitable class (+9.5%). At a later stage, the comparison between computed suitability and actual land use helped with identifying the areas where forestry should be the only (or most) supported activity and the areas where to push integrated land uses. Our interpretation of the results allows us to recommend the adoption of agroforestry and intercropping as the main methodologies to integrate multiple aims such as the environmental conservation and the improvement of livelihoods.

TI  - Precrops alleviate soil physical limitations for soybean root growth in an Oxisol from southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of soil compaction on soybean root growth and grain yield can be alleviated by the presence of biopores and root channels in the soil profile. We hypothesize that cover crops (ruzigrass and oats) are better than grain crops (wheat and maize) to reduce the soil physical limitation to soybean root growth. We aimed to identify which precrops have higher potential to reduce the mechanical and water stresses resulting from soil compaction and soil desegregation, and to enhance soybean (Glycine max L) root growth and yield in an Oxisol (Rhodic Eutrudox), with clayey soil texture. Soybean was grown after four precrops (ruzigrass, oats, wheat, or maize), under four soil compaction levels [soil chiselling (MTC), no-tillage (NT), NT additionally compacted with four passes of a tractor (NTCT), and NT additionally compacted with eight passes of a grain harvester (NTCH)]. Soil physical attributes (bulk density, macroporosity, water-filled pore space and soil penentration resistance) in the soil profile (0-50 cm) and soybean components (grain yield, cumulative root length density and root dry mass) were investigated. Soil physical attributes were improved over time due to the combined effects of natural wetting-drying cycles and biopores created by the roots of precrops. Ruzigrass increased soybean root biomass and length density, mainly at deeper soil layers of compacted treatments (NTCT and NTCH). The rate of increase of soybean root length density in the soil profile was higher after ruzigrass cultivation in comparison with maize and oats. Soil compaction effects on grain yield were partially (NTCH) or totally (NTCT) alleviated after two years and ruzigrass intensified the mitigation process. Ruzigrass also resulted in higher soybean yields in comparison with maize, whereas NTCH and MTC reduced yields in approximately 400 kg ha(-1) (similar to 13 %) compared to NT and NTCT. Soil strengthening was more evident after ruzigrass and oats cultivation than maize or wheat cropping. Soil compaction in clayey Oxisols can be alleviated over time as a result of root channels provided by precrops combined with natural wetting-drying cycles. Among the evaluated precrops, ruzigrass is of particular interest, as it provides the most suitable soil physical environment for soybean root growth and grain yield. In contrast, chiselling was demonstrated to be a non-viable strategy to mitigate soil physical constraints for root growth and grain yields.

TI  - Water Context in Latin America and the Caribbean: Distribution, Regulations and Prospects for Water Reuse and Reclamation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Water scarcity is a problem of global relevance that is affecting more and more people in the world. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have around 35% of the world's renewable water resources. However, the management of water resources and inequality in access to water has made water scarcity a problem of growing interest in the region. The reuse of water could be an efficient measure to reduce the demand for water resources in the area. In particular, the reuse of greywater is a simple and decentralized method of water reuse, which would mitigate the impact of the lack of water in isolated or difficult-to-access areas. Using the Aquastat database, water consumption in the world and water availability in LAC were studied. In addition, the regulatory framework for water in LAC countries was studied, with an emphasis on water reuse and greywater legislation. Agriculture is one of the most demanding of water in the world, particularly, in LAC, which demands around 70% of renewable water resources. Furthermore, in LAC, the availability of drinking water in rural areas is lacking, with seven countries having less than 80% access to healthy drinking water. The water regulation in LAC is quite heterogeneous. The most general regulation around water is found in the political constitutions of each country. Some constitutions explicitly indicate access to water as a human right, while other constitutions do not include information in this regard. Although some countries have specific regulations on the reuse of wastewater, there is a general lack of regulations related to the reuse of greywater. In most cases, the term "greywater" is not even defined in the general water and wastewater laws. As of the date of this article, only Chile, Peru, and Brazil have bills to regulate the reuse of greywater, of which only the Chilean is approved. The reuse of greywater could help reduce water demand for non-drinking uses. However, the implementation of greywater treatment systems represents a cost that is difficult to cover, especially in the poorest countries of the region. Countries must improve their public policies to improve the management, use and reuse of water to mitigate water scarcity that severely affects human consumption in the region. The relevance of this study lies in providing a general framework of the water situation in LAC for studies and public policies focused on promoting water reuse as a measure to mitigate water scarcity.

TI  - Potential of integrated trees-pasture-based systems for GHG emission mitigation and improving soil carbon dynamics in the Atlantic forest biome, Southeastern of Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian cattle production is mainly carried out in pastures, and mitigating the livestock's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become an essential prerequisite. The importance of planted forests in beef cattle pasture-based integrated systems has been widely recognized in the context of GHG emission mitigation. Adopting the intensification and integration with forest and crops of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimizing the soil and tree carbon (C) sequestration; however, research on tropical conditions is still necessary. This long-term trial evaluated the potential of C sequestration (soil + trees) of the forest and the grazing systems with two replicate areas of 3 ha each: 1. continuous stocking rate (CLS) - pasture under continuous stocking; 2. agropastoral or crop-livestock system (AGROP) - pasture under rotational stocking in rotation with corn; 3. agrosilvipastoral or crop-livestock-forestry system (AGROSIL) - similar to AGROP but including eucalyptus; 4. silvipastoral or livestock-forestry system (SIL) - pasture under rotational stocking + eucalyptus and 5. Atlantic Forest (FOR). Soil samples were analysed for texture, C and bulk density in eight soil layers from three to eight trenches for each treatment, then C stock and C accumulation rates were calculated. Data from Eucalyptus urograndis of the SIL and AGROSIL systems with 333 trees. ha- 1 during five first years and 166 trees. ha- 1 in subsequent years were collected (five- and eight-years old trees) and used to define the wood volume and acquire wood rings. Elemental analyzer CHN performed soil and trees C content. Equations for determining stem volume and tree biomass and, afterward, the C pools of the tree trunks were proposed. The potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e.. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil or soil + trees) was calculated, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. The participation of the C stock from the 0-30 cm soil layer was between 45 % and 53 % of the total C stock in the 0-100 cm soil layer. Regardless of the elevated C soil accumulation rates, 0.88, 2.54, and 1.74 t C. ha-1. year- 1 in the conversion stages CLS -> AGROP; AGROP -> SIL; AGROP -> AGROSIL, respectively, it was not possible to compensate for the negative result of the Forest -> CLS conversion (-2.55 t C. ha-1. year- 1) because this stage lasted 12 years, while the implementation of AGROSIL and SIL systems had only six years. However, when C tree accumulation rates were considered, the potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil +trees) was 19.89 to AGROSIL and 18.97 to SIL, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. Based on these results, it can be concluded that C sequestration in trees-pasture integrated systems occurs in layers deeper, with the diverse species contributing in different soil layers; there is a positive effect of improved land-use management, with the use of integrated systems on annual C soil sequestration and the trees consists of an important strategy to improve the GHG mitigation.

TI  - Maize crop yield in function of salinity and mulch
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation with saline water affects the agronomic performance of the maize crop; however, the use of vegetal mulch may mitigate salt stress and promote an increase in yield. In this way, this study aimed to evaluate the grain yield of the maize plants submitted to different water salinity levels in the presence and absence of mulch. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme. The first factor was the salinity of the irrigation water (1.0 and 4.0 dS m(-1)) and the second, with and without mulch, and five replicates. The variables analyzed were: unhusked ear mass, husked ear mass, cob mass, straw mass, husked ear diameter, husked ear length, and yield. The irrigation water with higher electrical conductivity affects negatively the ear mass with and without straw, ear diameter and ear length. The use of vegetation cover on the soil increased the unhusked ear mass with and without straw, ear diameter and length. The water with higher salinity (4.0 dS m(-1)) reduces the maize grain yield but with less intensity in the presence of mulch.

TI  - Production and water use efficiency of peanut under salt stress and soil cover
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper management of brackish water can increase plant production in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the production performance and water use efficiency of two peanut genotypes irrigated with brackish water during the reproductive stage, in soil with and without soil cover. The study was conducted in a greenhouse. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with four replicates, in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme (two electrical conductivities of irrigation water - ECw 0.9 and 5.0 dS m-1, two peanut genotypes - AC 130 and cv. BR1, and the presence or absence of soil cover). At 72 days after sowing, harvest was performed and the following variables were evaluated: number of marketable pods, number of non-marketable pods, pod mass, diameter and length, production and water use efficiency. Salinity impacted production more than the water use efficiency in the two peanut genotypes, with the relative reduction in production being higher in cv. BR-1. Soil cover with dead plant material mitigated the effects of salinity on production and increased water use efficiency, only in genotype AC 130.

TI  - Negotiation support models for integrated natural resource management in tropical forest margins
T2  - CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural resource management research has to evolve from a focus on plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, with a large number of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural resource management problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in local environmental services, but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management, Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people?

TI  - Why do medium- and large-scale farmers succeed practicing CA and small-scale farmers often do not? - experiences from Paraguay
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is defined as a system comprising no or minimum mechanical soil disturbance, permanent organic soil cover, and crop species diversification [FAO. (2014). What is Conservation Agriculture? FAO CA website, consulted on 15.09.2014. Retrieved September 15, 2014, from http://www.fao.org/ag/ca/la.html]. The vast majority of medium- and large-scale farmers in Paraguay and neighbouring countries (Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay) who use tractor-based farming systems have moved from conventional agriculture and adopted CA through no-tillage technologies. Among this farmer type, very few wish to return to the old system of tillage agriculture. However, despite massive efforts to transmit the technology to small-scale farmers by development aid projects and local governments, widespread adoption of CA has not happened on farms that use animal traction or manual farming systems; in fact significant dis-adoption of CA practices by smallholders has occurred. Some of the reasons for this dynamic are analysed in this paper. The reasons for dis-adoption by small-scale farmers can be generally divided into two groups. One group has to do with the fact that, comparatively, small-scale farmers are less able to cope with the factors related to CA (e.g. degraded soils, recuperating and maintaining soil fertility and know-how) than medium- and large-scale farmers. The second group of reasons has to do with the approaches and strategies that development aid agencies and local governments have taken towards small-scale farmers, which have influenced small-scale farmers' ability to adopt and maintain CA practices. Small-scale farmers' main asset is the soil and the CA/no-tillage system is a knowledge-based, learning-intensive system. However, despite the technical support provided by aid agencies and local governments, small-scale farmers often lack a deeper understanding of the CA concepts and practices. This is attributable to the short- to medium-term and rather conservative transfer-of-technology approaches that have been applied by development aid agency and local government programmes over the years, without any changes and without adaptive research. The latter can be derived, for instance, from the accountability of results to donor agencies or the one-size-fits-all approach applied in order to achieve 'numbers'. One consequence of this is that ownership by and empowerment of farmers is often absent among dis-adopters. It therefore seems more suitable to apply long term, adaptable approaches to CA with smallholders. The lessons learned in Paraguay may well serve to properly direct future development intervention efforts in this country and also serve to mend development strategies in other countries in South and Central America, Africa or Asia.

TI  - Coal Post-Mining Reclamation Using Pterocarpus indicus
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining is generally carried out through open pit mining methods which have an impact and become an obstacle to changes in the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the soil. Revegetation of reclaimed land is a priority in restoring ecosystems disrupted by mining activities. This study aims to assess the success of the direct planting method in accelerating the growth of Pterocarpus indicus plants in coal mining reclamation areas. Field data and observations are used to evaluate the growth of plants directly planted in reclaimed post-mining land. The growth parameters observed include plant height, stem diameter, and leaf count using both seedling and stem -cutting planting materials. The research results indicate that the direct planting method has a significant impact on accelerating the growth of Pterocarpus indicus plants. The plant height, diameter, and leaf count growth from the ANOVA test results showed a significant effect or significance at p<0.05 for the interaction between planting material, fertilizer, and dosage. The Duncan test results for the average plant height, stem diameter, and leaf count indicate the optimal use of bokashi fertilizer. The effective bokashi fertilizer dosage for each variable is 3 kg/planting hole, resulting in a plant height of 102.31 cm; 3 kg/planting hole, resulting in a stem diameter of 24.26 cm; and 5 kg/planting hole, resulting in a leaf count of 41.32.

T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Small-scale dairy farming in rural areas of Rio de Janeiro state is characterized by low levels of productivity, lack of technological innovation, and land degradation particularly due to overgrazing. A field study was conducted to identify the potentialities and constraints to adopt integrated systems pasture-tree-livestock (silvopastoral systems, SPS) to improve small-scale dairy farming in Italva municipality in the Northwest of the state. Qualitative and quantitative information on dairy production regimes as well as the willingness to adopt SPS was collected, based on semi-structured interviews. The present dairy farming system was analyzed and characterized. Additionally, an on-farm fodder bank trial plot, adapted to the local socio-environmental conditions, was implemented. The barriers for adoption and socio-environmental benefits for small dairy farmers were identified and analyzed. Lessons learned from this research such as the reluctance to adopt these systems due to the long-term investment return and the high costs for initial implementation show the need of expanding the dissemination of knowledge and implementation of SPS in the region. Research and trainings were integrated in participatory capacity building of farmers to provide adequate tools and concepts and support decision-making.

TI  - Nature vs. nurture: managing relationships between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st World Congress of Agroforestry
CL  - Univ Florida, Orlando, FL
AB  - Many agroforestry systems are found in places that otherwise would be appropriate for natural forests, and often have replaced them. Humans have had a profound influence on forests virtually everywhere they both are found. Thus 'natural' defined as 'without human influence' is a hypothetical construct, though one that has assumed mythological value among many conservationists. Biodiversity is a forest value that does not carry a market price. It is the foundation, however, upon which productive systems depend. The relationship between agroforestry and the wild biodiversity contained in more natural forests is a complicated one, depending on the composition of the agroforestry system itself and the way it is managed. Complex forest gardens are more supportive of biodiversity than monocrop systems, shade coffee more than sun coffee, and systems using native plants tend to be more biologically diverse. Nonnative plants, especially potentially invasive alien species, threaten biodiversity and need to be avoided. The relationship between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity can be made most productive through applying adaptive management approaches that incorporate ongoing research and monitoring in order to feed information back into the management system. Maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems will provide humanity with the widest range of options for adapting to changing conditions. Clear government policy frameworks are needed that support alliances among the many interest groups involved in forest biodiversity.

TI  - Landscape composition is more important than local vegetation structure for understory birds in cocoa agroforestry systems
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity-friendly agricultural systems allow the maintenance of native species even in highly fragmented landscapes by providing corridors to species dispersion and offering supplementary resources for animal populations. In the tropical region, cocoa agroforestry systems are of great importance for biodiversity conservation as they maintain part of the native vegetation, and therefore can be used by the local fauna. In this system, understory of native forests is replaced by cocoa trees, which are shaded by large old-growth trees. However, the persistence of native species in cocoa agroforests depends on local vegetation characteristics but also the landscape structure in which these systems are located. Here, we investigated the influence of landscape composition (i.e. amount of forest cover, cocoa agroforestry and cattle pasture) and local vegetation structure (i.e. number of native and cocoa trees, basal area of native trees and canopy closure) on understory birds in 18 cocoa agroforestry systems located in three regions in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, presenting distinct land use contexts. Specifically, we assessed the effects of these landscape and local features in predicting richness and abundance patterns of the entire community, and also in distinct ecological groups, such as forest-dependent and non-forestdependent birds, and insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. Using generalized linear models and Akaike information criterion, we observed lower species richness of complete community, non-forest and omnivorous birds in the most deforested region. Also, our findings demonstrated that cocoa agroforests integrated in more forested landscapes harbor greater richness and abundance of frugivorous birds. Conversely, the increase in cattle pasture amount at the landscape had a harsh effect on all bird groups evaluated. Regarding local vegetation, we observed that the increase of canopy closure leads to greater abundance of insectivorous birds in cocoa agmforestry systems. Similarly, abundance of non-forest species increased in agroforests with higher number of cocoa trees. Our study demonstrated that cocoa agroforestry systems can provide complementary habitats for many species, including forest birds, and therefore can mitigate the effects of habitat loss. However, this key benefit for bird conservation will be more effective when these agmforestry systems are located in more forested landscapes, with low amount of cattle pastures. Our findings therefore reinforce the alarming need to maintain and recover landscape-scale forest amount to ensure species persistence of birds in anthmpogenic landscapes, even in those comprising biodiversity-friendly land uses such as cocoa agmforestry systems.

TI  - Loss of secondary-forest resilience by land-use intensification in the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon.2. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience.3. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed-to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased.4. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked - importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience.5. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.

TI  - Financial and ecological analysis of management options for logged-over Dipterocarp forests in Indonesian Borneo
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of areas of logged-over tropical forests requires an understanding of the potential yield from the forest and likely financial performance of the management system. This paper describes an analytical approach that involves the linkage of a simulation model of forest growth and yield to a financial model based on data from a forest concession in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The growth and yield model SYMFOR (silviculture and yield management for tropical forests) was linked to a financial model derived for a forest concession managed under the Indonesian selective logging and replanting system (TPTI). This combined approach was used in this study to predict the likely timber yield for contrasting management regimes and then to calculate estimates of the financial performance described as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) of the forest estate.This approach was used in a study that compared the standard TPTI system with alternatives that combined reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques with alternative systems of yield regulation. The TPTI system regulates timber yield using a single diameter limit given for each type of forest (currently two categories for lowland Dipterocarp forests and one for swamp forest). The alternative systems that were evaluated included one defined by a maximum of eight harvested stems per hectare and others based on maximum volume extracted of either 50 or 60 m(3) ha(-1). Each of these systems was evaluated for cutting cycle lengths of 25; 35 and 45 years. These management regimes were implemented for a simulated period representing three additional cutting cycles. The impacts of alternative management regimes were compared through statistical analysis of the results from the simulations that was able to remove the effect of the very significant variability between experimental plots.The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the conventional TPTI management system failed to achieve criteria of sustainability for timber yield and financial performance. Average yields dropped from over 80 m(3) ha(-1) for the first simulated harvest from the logged-over area (second harvest) to between 35 and 40 m3 ha-1 for the third and fourth harvests. The financial analysis showed that this system was not viable after the second harvest leaving the only financially viable alternative of land conversion after clear felling of the remaining forest.The alternative management regimes based on reduced impact logging and more effective systems of timber yield regulation performed much better. The study suggested that management systems based on a cutting cycle of 35 years with yield regulated to 50 m(3) ha(-1) or 45 years with yield regulated to 60 m3 ha-1 were the best alternatives to the current TPTI system. Neither of these two alternatives was able to consistently achieve the desired internal rate of return of 16% unless there were also decreases in wastage associated with the harvesting and timber extraction.Optimisation techniques where used to determine the combination that would produce an internal rate of return of at least 16%. This process suggested that the concession studied would be able to achieve or exceed this criterion over all harvests when (a) a management regime involving a cutting cycle of 45 years is combined with a yield regulation system harvesting a maximum of 60 m(3) ha(-1) and (b) the efficiency of timber conversion increases from 52 to 60%. It is considered that this is readily achievable using existing methods and appropriate training.The methods described in this paper can be transferred to other concessions or countries and may be modified to utilise alternative growth and yield or financial models. The paper also indicates that the approach could be adapted,to consider a wider range of goods and services provided by forests to extend the analysis into a more comprehensive economic analysis. A preliminary consideration of these issues demonstrated that the system of management selected on the basis of timber yield and financial performance will also provide benefits for the environment and local communities.

TI  - Conservation agriculture for small holder rainfed farming: Opportunities and constraints of new mechanized seeding systems
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Small holder farmers in rainfed agriculture believe that soil tillage is needed to maximize crop yields. However, as cropping intensity, and hence tillage intensity, increases there may be a decline in particular physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil which limit crop yield. This is primarily caused by declining soil organic matter, its oxidation being accelerated by tillage, particularly in warmer climates, and exacerbated by the limited return of above-ground biomass to the soil due to its competing use for other purposes. In large-scale commercial agriculture declining soil quality has been effectively addressed by conservation agriculture cropping systems based on minimum tillage, crop residue retention and appropriate crop rotations and associations, preferably including legumes. This has required development of minimum tillage planting equipment along with herbicide technology to achieve weed control that is traditionally achieved through tillage. However, a shortage of mechanized options suitable for small holder farmers is creating an impediment to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices that would arrest the decline in soil quality in their fields. In South Asia, two-wheel tractors are replacing animal-drawn ploughing in small holder plots. This speeds the tillage operation and hence the turnaround time between crops, which may increase opportunities for crop intensification, but the problems associated with full tillage remain. Over the previous decade planter attachments to two-wheel tractors have been developed which permit seed and fertilizer placement with minimum to zero tillage in a single-pass. Recent tests have demonstrated that use of these implements can produce crop yields equal to or better than conventional tillage involving hand broadcasting of seed and fertilizer. Further, fuel and labour costs, seed and fertilizer inputs and turnaround time between crops can be reduced. In Africa, the introduction of animal-drawn rippers and direct seeders, originally developed for small-scale farmers in Brazil, is considered as a major breakthrough to small-scale farmer mechanization. It significantly reduces labour required for planting and benefits may be even greater if herbicides can be effectively used for weed control. Nevertheless, movement towards minimum tillage with two-wheel tractor mounted planters and animal-drawn direct seeding equipment is constrained by weed management issues. There are problems of availability and of safe and effective use of herbicides by resource-poor farmers and there is a need to develop more integrated weed management strategies that can be combined with small-scale planters. There is also a need to optimize the performance of small-scale planters to suit farmers' needs in different agro-ecological environments. Tools and concepts are now available to implement conservation agriculture for small holders and thereby increase profitability of their cropping practices and at the same time improve soil quality and sustainability of their livelihoods. However, much more adaptive research and on-farm evaluation is needed across a diverse range of soils, cropping systems and agro-ecological regions to bring conservation agriculture to more small holders.

TI  - Fractions of Organic Matter and Soil Carbon Balance in Different Phases of an Agroforestry System in the Cerrado: A Ten-Year Field Assessment
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated production systems composed of trees, crops and pastures have shown good results in improving soil quality and the capacity to store carbon in the soil, being efficient in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, changes in carbon stocks and soil organic matter fractions in the initial stages of implementing an agroforestry system remain unclear. This study evaluated the carbon balance and the dynamics of soil organic matter fractions in an agroforestry system conducted over a decade. Total carbon, labile carbon, carbon from particulate organic matter, organic carbon associated with minerals and inert carbon were determined at depths 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm. Soil carbon stocks were also estimated for the 0-40 cm depth. Total carbon increased in the agroforestry system compared with a low-productivity pasture. The total carbon stock in the last growing season (68.57 Mg ha(-1)) was close to the original soil stocks under native Cerrado vegetation (76.5 Mg ha(-1)). After 10 years, there was a positive balance in the soil carbon stock of both the total carbon and the soil organic matter fractions. The successional agroforestry system is a good alternative to increasing soil total carbon stocks and labile and non-labile fractions of soil organic matter.

TI  - Mitigation of ammonia and greenhouse gases emissions from urea coated with oil shale residues in a silvopastoral system
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of using retorted oil shale as urea coating (U + ROS) in the decrease of N losses by ammonia (NH3-N) volatilization. The experiment was carried out in a silvopastoral system with a randomized block design with split-plots. The main treatments consisted of spatial arrangements of the trees, while the subdivision of the plots constituted the surface application of common urea (U) and retorted oil shale-coated urea (U + ROS) for the pasture. In addition to NH3 measurements, fluxes of N2O and CH4 in the soil were determined, as well as soil moisture and contents of mineral N (0-5 cm). Independently of tree spacing, the use of ROS along with urea (U + ROS) showed a mean decrease of 15.9% in the accumulated NH3 volatilization and 24.1% in the peaks of emission, although it was not significantly different from the U treatment (P < 0.10). In addition, it did not increase significantly the N2O and CH4 emissions, evidencing a potential to decrease N losses by ammonia volatilization, with no impact on greenhouse gases emissions from the soil.

TI  - The depleted mineralization of the fungicide chlorothalonil derived from loss in soil microbial diversity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are lack of studies regarding the effects of microbial diversity on specific soil functions, such as pesticides degradation. This study evaluated the role of bacterial community diversity and biochar on chlorothalonil (CTN) degradation, using 'dilution to extinction' approach, PCR-DGGE/16S rRNA gene technique, and radiorespirometry (14C-CTN). Biochar and microbial community dilution affected structure of the microbial community. In spite of that, CTN mineralization was slow, but dissipation was very fast (D-50 < 1.0 d) due to immediate chemical degradation and formation of nonextractable (bound) residues. However, any depletion on soil microbial diversity strongly affected CTN mineralization, suggesting that this function is related to less abundant but specific microbial groups (CTN degraders) or to soil microbial diversity. The extent of these effects will strongly depend on the compound nature (recalcitrance) and soil matrix/substrate (bioavailability). It can be corroborated by the fact that biochar affected CTN sorption, its bioavailability, and subsequently its mineralization rate in the NS. These data indicate a strong relationship between soil microbial diversity and pesticide degradation, which is an acting form to mitigate xenobiotics accumulation in the environment.

TI  - PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF YELLOW PASSION FRUIT WITH USE OF HYDROGEL AND MULCHING
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian semi-arid region, water deficit is one of the main factors that compromise the growth and productive yield of crops, including yellow passion fruit, due to the limitation of carbon assimilation by the photosynthetic activity of plants. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the soil with technologies that can reduce the loss of water in the soil and mitigate the effects of water deficit on yellow passion fruit plants cultivated under semi-arid conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the application of hydrogel doses and mulching to the soil on the physiological aspects of irrigated yellow passion fruit cultivation. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design, in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, referring to five doses of hydrogel (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 g dm-3 of soil) in soil without and with mulching from signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens L.). The variables analyzed were chlorophyll indices, fluorescence (initial, maximum and variable) and gas exchange. The total chlorophyll index was increased with the application of 1.5 g dm-3 of hydrogel and the use of mulching; when applying hydrogel doses of 2.0 g dm-3 the photosynthetic rate of yellow passion fruit plants increased, whereas their transpiration rate increased with the use of mulching and doses of hydrogel; as a consequence, there was a reduction in water use efficiency.

TI  - Manipulation of Rumen Fermentation by Bioindustrial Products of Cashew Nut Shell (Anacardium occidentale) to Reduce Methane Production
T2  - JURNAL ILMU TERNAK DAN VETERINER
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the strategies to reduce methane produced by ruminants is by the application of feed additive from plant materials. One of the potential plants is cashew plant especially its shell. The cashew nut shell can be processed to become 3 bioindustrial products; ie biofat, biochar, biosmoke. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectively of biofat, biochar and biosmoke in reducing methane and other end product of rumen fermentation. The experiment was arranged in block randomize design based on time series of in vitro to evaluate 3 levels and 3 types of bioindustrial. The treatments were Control (substrate=S), Biofat: S+0.25 mu L/mL, S+0.5 mu L/mL, S+0.75 mu L/mL, Biochar: S+0.1 mg/mL, S+0.2 mg/mL, S+0.3 mg/mL, Biosmoke: S + 2.5 mu L/mL, S+5.0 mu L/mL, S + 7.5 mu L/mL. Each treatment was done in duplicates and the in vitro experiment was repeated 4 times. The research measured total gas production; methane production; digestibility of dry matter, organic matter and neutral detergent fibre (NDF); ammonia concentration (NH3); partial and total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration. The results showed that biofat, biochar and biosmoke reduced methane production by 43.88%, 24.21%, 37.88% at the highest level of inclusion, respectively. The NH3 concentration slightly increased by biochar and biosmoke addition. Molar proportion of acetic acid decreased, while molar proportion of propionic acid increased by addition of the three bioindustrial products. Organic matter digestibility decreased significantly with biofat and biosmoke addition. The mechanism of biofat, biochar and biosmoke in affecting rumen fermentation was different. It can be concluded that the three bioindustrial products of cashew nut shell can be utilized as feed additive to reduce methane and increase propionic acid production in the rumen.

TI  - Community loggers attempting to legalize traditional timber harvesting in the Brazilian Amazon: An endless path
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a case study to analyze the challenges experienced by small loggers in implementing a Community Forest Management (CFM) model demanded by external environmental agencies. The case study was undertaken within traditional communities located in Boa Vista do Ramos County, Amazonas State. With environmental issues surrounding tropical forest becoming increasingly disputed, traditional logging activities performed by locals came to be regarded as illegal. We believe that despite significant efforts to promote CFM initiatives, principally undertaken via public policy, small loggers have in fact had little success adapting to this new legal context. The results demonstrated that when small-scale loggers where supported by specific regulations and some external assistance they were able to collectivize their activities, forming the Community Association of Agricultural and Forest Products Harvesting (ACAF). After meeting challenges to strengthen their technical, social and managerial aspects, ACAF obtained environmental licenses and forest certification. However subsequent changes in forest policies lead to the termination of CFM-oriented regulations and ACAF weakened. Nevertheless, the social and human capital that had been developed in the collective ended up being successfully applied to other individual small-scale projects in the same region. We condude that despite the community loggers' success in establishing a new and more sustainable way of working, they were not able to continue these activities within this new legal environment. The policies and laws that apply to CFM are more oriented to conservation goals than to meeting the demands of producers and contributing to their livelihoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Production of watermelon seedlings in different substrates under salt stress
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt stress affects the production of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) seedlings. However, substrates with alternative materials in their composition can mitigate the harmful effects on the formation of watermelon seedlings. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the emergence and production of watermelon seedlings grown in different substrates under salt stress. The research was conducted in an agricultural greenhouse belonging to the Universidade da Integracao Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira, Redencao, Ceara, Brazil. The experimental design used was completely randomized in a split-plot scheme. The plots were five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw: 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 dS m-1) and the subplots consisted of two formulations of substrates (SB1: sandy soil + sand + bovine manure; and SB2: sandy soil + sand + biochar; both in a 1:1:1 proportion on volume basis), with five repetitions of 25 seeds. The increase in the electrical conductivity of irrigation water from 1.5 dS m-1 reduces the percentage, speed index, and mean speed of emergence and increases the mean time of emergence of the watermelon crop. Substrate formulated with biochar reduces the time and increases the emergence indexes, besides enabling higher growth and biomass accumulation of watermelon seedlings. Salt stress reduces the growth, biomass, and quality of watermelon seedlings, but with less intensity with the addition of biochar.

TI  - Agroforestry Land Use Land Cover Area Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the location and extent of agroforestry land use land cover (LULC) in Lampung Province is critical for effective policy development and sustainable agroforestry management. However, existing monitoring efforts have been limited to small regions. This study addressed this gap by employing threshold values from five distinct vegetation indices (ARVI, EVI, GDVI, NDVI, and SAVI) derived from Landsat 9 OLI imagery to accurately identify and estimate agroforestry LULC across the Lampung Province. The data collection activities were carried out using a combination of Landsat 9 OLI satellite imagery acquisition, and ground truth validation on 7 classes of different land use (forest, agroforestry, dry land farming, ricefield, settlements, bare land, and water bodies) within 5,600 points of interest (POI) inside 5 regencies as an area of interest (AOI). This study aimed to predict agroforestry area based on vegetation indices (VIs) threshold using the decision tree (DT) algorithm. The research process involved a series of systematic steps, beginning with satellite image data acquisition and preprocessing, VIs values extraction, and DT sequential for agroforestry areas. The DT computation incorporated the value of each LULC type on the 5 VIs. The result showed that the overall accuracy reached 91.59% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.89, indicating a high level of accuracy for land cover identification. The DT algorithm calculation showed that the agroforestry in Lampung Province estimated spanned for 734,739.61 ha, determined only by NDVI and ARVI. The findings have significant implications for both policy development and agroforestry management. Accurate LULC classification enhances decision-making processes by providing reliable data on land use patterns, which can guide sustainable land management practices and support the creation of region-specific agroforestry policies. This research directly informs policymakers on the extent and distribution of agroforestry areas, offering a foundation for crafting strategies aimed at promoting sustainable land use while mitigating environmental degradation. The methodology also provides a scalable approach for other regions facing similar agroforestry and land management challenges.

T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main difficulties in implementing agroforestry systems is the choice of component species. This research aimed to verify the feasibility of using two Amazonian species in an agroforestry system, quantifying the possible interference of the dominant species (Brazilian mahogany) on the lower canopy species (cupuassu tree). The experiment was conducted for 14 years, on a commercial property in Tom??-A??u, PA. Four levels of spacing between cupuassu tree and mahogany trees were established: Level 1 = 2.3 m; Level 2 = 5.5 m; Level 3 = 7.3 m; Level 4 = 8.8 m. The initial vegetative development of the cupuassu tree, the production during 12 harvests, and the mortality rate were evaluated. For mahogany, the vigor of the plants was measured and wood production estimates were made. In addition, some morphometric parameters were estimated to verify the adaptation of mahogany to the SAF environment and its influence on cupua??uzeiro. The results showed that the cupuassu tree had a good vegetative development, showing that it was not harmed by the competition with the mahogany trees. Fruit production was also not affected by the consortium, just as there were no differences in mortality rates at different levels of species proximity. Mahogany grew vigorously, benefiting from the cultural treatments normally provided in cupuassu tree orchards, such as annual fertilization and water supply. Based on the evidence obtained, it can be concluded that the SAF made up of Brazilian mahogany and cupuassu tree, in the spaces used here, offers appropriate conditions for the development of both species, and could be an alternative to conventional production systems in the Amazon, as well as, to increase the restoration of anthropized areas with native species.

TI  - Spectroscopic Investigation on the Effects of Biochar and Soluble Phosphorus on Grass Clipping Vermicomposting
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seeking to evaluate the hypothesis that biochar optimises the composting and vermicomposting processes as well as their product quality, we carried out field and greenhouse experiments. Four grass clipping composting treatments (only grass, grass + single superphosphate (SSP), grass + biochar and grass + SSP + biochar) were evaluated. At the end of the maturation period (150 days), the composts were submitted to vermicomposting (Eisenia fetida earthworm) for an additional 90 days. Ordinary fine charcoal was selected due to its low cost (a by-product of charcoal production) and great availability; this is important since the obtained product presents low commercial value. A greater maturity of the organic matter (humification) was observed in the vermicompost treatments compared with the compost-only treatments. The addition of phosphate significantly reduced the pH (from 6.7 to 4.8), doubled the electrical conductivity and inhibited biological activity, resulting in less than 2% of the number of earthworms found in the treatment without phosphate. The addition of soluble phosphate inhibited the humification process, resulting in a less-stable compound with the preservation of labile structures, primarily cellulose. The P species found corroborate these findings because the pyrophosphate conversion from SSP in the absence of biochar may explain the strong acidification and increased electric conductivity. Biochar appears to prevent this conversion, thus mitigating the deleterious effects of SSP and favouring the formation of organic P species from SSP (78.5% of P in organic form with biochar compared to only 12.8% in the treatments without biochar). In short, biochar decreases pyrophosphate formation from SSP, avoiding acidification and salinity; therefore, biochar improves the whole composting and vermicomposting process and product quality. Vermicompost with SSP and biochar should be tested as a soil conditioner on account of its greater proportion of stabilized C and organic P.

T2  - CABI AGRICULTURE AND BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The recovery process of degraded areas with the implantation of orchards of native species is still little known. Thus, we intend to evaluate the physiological performance of Hancornia speciosa during different seasons of the year, cultivated in full sun and in intercropping for recovery of degraded areas. Methods Intercropping with Syagrus oleracea (double intercropping); with annual crops (double intercropping); and with S. oleracea and annual crops (triple intercropping) were completed over two years at the beginning of each season. Crops (experimental plots) were planted using a Nelder wheel design. Results Over the two years, H. speciosa was observed to experience seasonal regulatory changes, some of which were mitigated by the intercropping. The cultivation arrangement influenced the physiology and consequently the growth of H. speciosa. Conclusions It is concluded that the double intercropping benefits the growth of H. speciosa during the formation of the orchard, and the triple intercropping does not affect growth in relation to full sun. It is recommended the implantation of orchards of H. speciosa in recovery areas through intercropping.

TI  - Feeding activities of soil organisms at four different forest sites in Central Amazonia using the bait lamina method
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A recently developed technique in soil ecology is the use of the bait lamina method, for assessing the feeding activity of soil animals in situ. Here the bait lamina method (slightly adapted to tropical conditions) was used for the comparison of four closely situated sites (a primary rain forest, a secondary rain forest and two mixed-species tree plantations) in the Brazilian Amazon (project SHIFT ENV-52). The total feeding activity (portion of empty apertures in a set of laminae) and the vertical distribution of the feeding activity were evaluated for differences between the sites. The feeding activities in the primary and secondary forest were at the same level and significantly lower than in the two plantations. Feeding activity in subplots where surface litter has been experimentally removed was significantly lower than in the controls with the litter layer intact, at all four sites. The abundance of soil macrofauna or Enchytraeidae was not correlated with the results of the bait lamina tests, while the abundance of mesofauna, (probably mainly Oribatida) was consistent with the pattern of feeding activity. The feeding activities as determined with bait laminae did not correlate with the decomposition activities determined with litterbags. Due to the easy applicability in combination with its feasibility for statistical evaluation and its consistent responses to site differences in experimental treatments we consider the bait lamina method to be a promising approach for the biological assessment of tropical soils.

TI  - Cupuacu tree genotype selection for an agroforestry system environment in the Amazon
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to select cupuacu (Theobroma grandiflorum) tree progenies and individuals based on their agronomic traits, and, indirectly, to identify those adapted to an agroforestry system (AFS) environment in the Brazilian Amazon. For this purpose, 25 full-sib progenies were planted and tested in consortium with black pepper (Piper nigrum), banana (Musa spp.), and bacuri (Platonia insignis) trees. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design, with five replicates and three plants per plot, from 2005 to 2019. For the statistical analyses, the phenotypic averages for production and incidence of witches' broom disease, evaluated during 11 harvests, were used. Superior progenies and individuals were identified using the mixed model methodology (REML/BLUP), which led to the selection of ten plants from five families with superior agronomic traits. Cupuacu tree progenies 6, 36, 37, 49, and 52 are the ones that best adapt to the environment of a multispecies AFS in the Amazon region because of their agronomic traits under competitive conditions. Ten matrices show agronomic potential and indirect adaptation to the AFS and can be used as clonal cupuacu cultivars in this environment.

TI  - Agroforestry System Based on Local Wisdom for Small Island Communities
T2  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY 2022
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 4th International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF) - Agroforestry for Sustainable and Resilient Communities
CL  - Sabah, MALAYSIA
AB  - The communities of small islands have local wisdom in the agroforestry system as a form of adaptation to agricultural technology in a dry land with dry climates. This study aims to find and explain agroforestry systems based on local wisdom in small islands. The study was conducted in April-December 2021. The case study is located on Wangi-Wangi Island, Wakatobi Regency, Southeast Sulawesi Province with the consideration that this area can represent the characteristics of the agroforestry system in small island communities in the Southeast Sulawesi archipelago. Data were collected through observation, interviews, and literature studies using the triangulation method. Data were analyzed descriptively and qualitatively using historical and phenomenological approaches. The results showed that there were agroforestry systems based on local wisdom, namely weli'a, rawu'a, and ontoala. The three systems are applied to different topographical characteristics of the land and have been proven to be socially, economically, and ecologically beneficial.

TI  - Cover crops for no-tillage vegetable systems as a climate crisis mitigation strategy in organic Cucurbitaceae production
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional vegetable farming model aggravates the climate crisis, whereas the no-tillage system provides a sustainable alternative. This study aimed to identify winter cover crops for single cropping and intercropping by evaluating the biomass production and degradability, as well as their impact on Cucurbitaceae production in organic no-tillage system. The experiment was conducted in an area with Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo and other with Cucumis sativus. A randomized complete block design was used, with three replicates. The treatments included the single cropping of black oat (Avena strigosa), rye (Secale cereale) and vetch (Vicia sativa), as well as the intercropping systems black oat + vetch, black oat + vetch + radish (Raphanus sativus), rye + vetch + radish and winter fallow. The Poaceae treatments showed a higher biomass production and half-life, with the black oat biomass contributing to the greatest zucchini yield, whereas the Japanese cucumber showed a superior performance when grown with cover crops. Thus, the black oat + vetch + radish or rye + vetch + radish intercropping systems are the most recommended ones for the organic notillage system.

TI  - N Fertilizer Dose-Dependent Efficiency of Serratia spp. for Improving Growth and Yield of Upland Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Serratia spp., strain BRM 32114, is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria that show strong potential to solve two major challenges of upland rice production in a no-tillage system: initial vigor and grain yield improvement. No-till practices dictate the sustainability of cropping systems as they improve precipitation use, sequester C, mitigate atmospheric CO2 enrichment, restore soil health, and stimulate interest in crop diversity and rotation design. This study was intended to analyze the effect of the Serratia spp. on growth promotion and grain yield improvement in upland rice, under four N rates. Two field experiments were conducted during growing seasons 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, in two different experimental areas managed under a no-tillage system in the Brazilian Cerrado soil. The experimental design was a complete randomized block in a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, with four replications. Treatments comprised of four N fertilizer rates (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) with or without BRM 32114. In BRM 32114 treatment, rice seeds were microbiolized and bacterial suspension were sprayed at soil/plant in the field on the 7th and 15th DAS (day after sowing). Morphophysiological (gas exchange, shoot nutrients content and biomass production), and agronomic (grain yield and its components) traits were estimated. Results revealed increase in stomatal conductance (similar to 20%); N, Ca and Mg (7, 11 and 9%) contents; shoot dry matter (8%); number of grain per plant (17%); mass of 1000 grains (2%) and yield (similar to 22%) in BRM 32114-treated rice and cultivated in soil fertilized with 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1). However, the efficacy of this strain was reduced when combined with the highest rate of N (120 kg ha(-1)) added to the soil. It is possible to get higher yields levels of upland rice, cultivated under no tillage system, with the complimentary use of Serratia sp., strain BRM 32114, than the application of chemical fertilizers alone. The improvement in soil health could be extra benefit for fertilizer' savings.

TI  - Use of shrimp farming waste in the production of biomaterials for sustainable agriculture and mitigation of environmental damage
T2  - JSFA REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Due to the environmental degradation caused by shrimp farming in Brazilian mangrove ecosystems, it is of great importance to develop techniques capable of inserting waste into the production chain, strengthening the premise of sustainable shrimp farming development due to its economic and social impact. In this work, solid residues from shrimp farming were used as a slow-release fertilizer (SRF) in formulations that also contain chitosan, montmorillonite, and urea. Results: Fertilizer granules produced without (FERT A) and with additional layers (FERT B) were characterized by elemental analysis (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen), obtaining values of 14.4%-18.4% for carbon, 5.6%-6.9% for hydrogen, and 12.3%-19.3% for nitrogen. The fertilizers had low C/N ratios of around 1.0-1.50, compared to a value of 0.87 for urea, the nitrogen fertilizer most widely used in Brazilian agriculture. Release tests in water showed the same release pattern in the first 5 min for FERT A and FERT B, with <10% urea release. After 30 min, the release from the fertilizers progressively increased, reaching >60% after 1 day and a maximum of 95%-97% after 15 days. In the first 3 days of incubation in the soil, the releases of nitrogen from FERT A, FERT B, and conventional urea presented different patterns, with values of 32%, 10%, and 90%, respectively. After incubation for 25 days, FERT A and FERT B presented nitrogen releases lower than 78%, confirming the slow release of the nutrient from these fertilizers. Degradation experiments showed that the fertilizers were biodegradable in the soil, with degradation exceeding 60% after 30 days, indicating that they could be applied to the soil without leaving residues. Conclusions: The fertilizer granules produced are SRFs that have the potential to increase the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization, reducing the frequency of applications and minimizing nitrogen losses in the soil. In addition, they enable the reuse of shrimp farming waste, producing a new material of agricultural interest.

TI  - Polluted lignocellulose-bearing sediments as a resource for marketable goods-a review of potential technologies for biochemical and thermochemical processing and remediation
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lignocellulose-bearing sediments are legacies of the previously unregulated wastewater discharge from the pulp and paper industry, causing large quantities of toxic organic waste on the Baltic Sea floor and on the bottom of rivers and lakes. Several km(2) are covered with deposits of lignocellulosic residues, typically heavily contaminated with complex mixtures of organic and inorganic pollutants, posing a serious threat to human and ecological health. The high toxicity and the large volume of the polluted material are challenges for remediation endeavours. The lignocellulosic material is also a considerable bioresource with a high energy density, and due to its quantity, it could appeal to commercialization as feedstock for various marketable goods. This study sets out to explore the potential of using this polluted material as a resource for industrial production at the same time as it is detoxified. Information about modern production methods for lignocellulosic material that can be adapted to a polluted feedstock is reviewed. Biochemical methods such as composting, anaerobic digestion, as well as, thermochemical methods, for instance, HTC, HTL, pyrolysis, gasification and torrefaction have been assessed. Potential products from lignocellulose-bearing sediment material include biochar, liquid and gaseous biofuels, growing substrate. The use of a contaminated feedstock may make the process more expensive, but the suggested methods should be seen as an alternative to remediation methods that only involve costs. Several experiments were highlighted that support the conception that combined remediation and generation of marketable goods may be an appropriate way to address polluted lignocellulose-bearing sediments.

TI  - Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment. Appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Environments that harbor a huge structural complexity, such as agroforestry systems, even the simplest ones, may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services. To examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity, we evaluate dung beetle (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in different land uses, considering: Brazilian Atlantic Forest, cacao-rubber agroforestry, and rubber monoculture. We found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture, as cacao-rubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture. Species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry, whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage. Although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market, our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity. We suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - COVID-19 and agricultural fire pollution in the Amazon: Puzzles and solutions
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Amazon, the quick spread of COVID-19 coincides with the high level of air pollution released during the "burning season", when thousands of square kilometres are prepared for agriculture. Mitigating health consequences by constraining fire use and social interaction is hindered by the dependence of local food security on fires, of enforcement on on-the-ground surveillance and of primary care on home visits. Based on fieldwork experience, alternatives to test potential solutions to the policy puzzles are proposed, highlighting the role of smallholder mechanization and of community health workers (CHWs). It is argued that randomized control trials could be designed to assess the effectiveness of tractor scheduling workshops, grassroots-based tractor administration, mobile-health-aided data collection by CHWs and data-driven algorithms to plan their home visits. The need for researcher-practitioner collaboration for optimized targeting of on-the-ground illegal fire deterrence is also stressed. The trials and the potential solutions to be trialled are more likely to be successful whether integrated into a broader and perennial process of research and development of interventions for sustainable development of the Amazon, whose need was widely revealed by the ongoing pandemic.

TI  - Reclamation of Saline Soil under Association between Atriplex nummularia L. and Glycophytes Plants
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoremediation is an efficient technique for the reclamation of salt-affected soils by growing plants. The present study aims to evaluate the intercropping of halophyte Atriplex nummularia Lindl. with naturally occurring species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) adapted to semiarid regions as a management capable of enhancing the phytoremediation capacity of these species. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized block and contained four replicates. Species were cultivated alone and in association with A. nummularia to evaluate their potential uses in the reclamation of soils. Exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+, as well as salinity and sodicity variables, were evaluated. The evaluations were performed at 9 and 18 months of plant growth. The results indicated that A. nummularia individualized was the treatment most efficient; with reductions of 80%, 63%, and 84% in electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, and exchangeable sodium percentage values, respectively at 18 months compared to starting of the experiment. However, the use of A. nummularia and species adapted to the semiarid in association, or even alone, promoted beneficial effects on the soil quality after the establishment of the plants.

TI  - Sprouting capacity of two eucalyptus clones in silvopastoral system in Southwest Amazonia
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the sprouting capacity of two eucalyptus clones under different levels of fertilization in a silvopastoral system in southwest Amazonia. The stand where budding was conducted was implanted in December 2018 in Capixaba, Acre. The trees underwent felling in December 2021. The statistical design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme of 2 (clones) x 3 (fertilization levels), with three replications and six treatments. Treatments with cloneVM01 showed survival values above 95%, which shows good adaptation to the environmental conditions of the region. Clone I144 treatments showed survival below 55% in the last evaluation. There was a strong correlation between vine diameter (dt) and survival (R), number of shoots (NB) and height of shoots (H), which contributed to the fact that treatments with clone VM01 presented the highest values for R , NB and H. Differentiation in applied NPK doses did not result in variations (p>0.05) in initial growth and leaf tissues. Sprouting proved to be a promising method for clone VM01, while for the management of clone I144; this technique should not be recommended for the study region.

TI  - Intercropping Short Rotation Timber Species with Teak: Enabling Smallholder Silviculture Practices
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community forest management for timber production requires short- and long-rotation companion species to fulfill the demands of the timber industry, improve farmer welfare and maintain environmental sustainability. Four species (Falcataria moluccana, Neolamarckia cadamba, Acacia mangium and Gmelina arborea) were tested as short-rotation timber crop companion species for teak (Tectona grandis) on dry-rocky soil in the Gunungkidul community forest. The selection of short-rotation timber species was based on growth performance and survival rate at the teak site. Two years after planting, the viability of G. arborea (87.3%) and A. mangium (78.2%) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of N. cadamba (40.6%) and F. moluccana (18.0%). G. arborea and N. cadamba achieved the best growth in terms of height, diameter, basal area, and volume, with the growth of A. mangium and F. moluccana being significantly inferior. Gmelina arborea has the ability to adapt to teak sites, grow well, and accompany teak. Neolamarckia cadamba demonstrated good growth with potential as a teak companion, and it demonstrated limited drought tolerance on the dry-rocky soils of the study sites. Acacia mangium had a high survival but produced slow growth, indicating that it required an advance evaluation in future years. Falcataria moluccana has different growing site requirements to teak so the performance was relatively poor at the study site. This mixed pattern provides benefits to farmers through commercial thinning of short rotations species, 5-8 years post establishment. Thinning operations will also increase the productivity of residual teak stands. The diversification of timber species in community forests can provide earlier returns, enabling the adoption of silviculture management by smallholders and communities.

TI  - Performance of a planter-fertiliser under reduced soil preparation: furrowers, speeds and depths when sowing maize
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The search to optimise agricultural systems by adapting mechanised sets for sowing maize, is essential for improving operational performance, energy efficiency and initial crop establishment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and sowing quality of a planter-fertiliser for maize, in a dystroferric Red Latosol managed under reduced tillage, as a function of the type of furrower, depth of seed deposition and operating speed of the planter. The experimental design was completely randomised, in a split-plot scheme with three replications, where the plots represented the type of furrowing mechanism (shank or double-disk) and the subplots represented three displacement speeds (3.20, 5.15 and 7.32 km h(-1)) and two sowing depths (35 and 40 mm). The best sowing quality for second-crop maize, the lowest power requirement at the tractor drawbar, the lowest specific and hourly fuel and consumption time, and the lowest travel reduction ratio are achieved when the tractor-planter-fertiliser set is configured to use a double-disk at a sowing depth of 35 mm. The adoption of higher displacement speeds results in increased operational and effective field capacity, as well as a lower energy demand when the tractor-planter-fertiliser set develops speeds close to or greater than 7.32 km h(-1), irrespective of furrower type or soil depth.

TI  - Indicators to quantify biodiversity gains for compensation and mineland rehabilitation in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - To connect the protection of natural resources to economic development, environmental rehabilitation is a promising way to repair and compensate for impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we aimed to compare and select potential indicators for the success of different rehabilitating ecosystems to quantify gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services within the Impact Mitigation Hierarchy. We sampled nine environmental variables along rehabilitation chronosequences from rehabilitating (i) iron mining waste piles, (ii) sand quarries, and (iii) compensation areas in the Caraj & aacute;s National Forest. From that, we computed the rehabilitation status, i.e., the proportion of environmental enhancements compared to the overall rehabilitation trajectory, and statistically validated the indicators that best described the status. With a mean rehabilitation status for the oldest rehabilitation stages from waste piles, sand quarries, and compensation areas of 52, 71, and 74%, respectively, we confirmed that rehabilitation activities were able to generate considerable gains in biodiversity. In all the cases, the Shannon diversity, phylogenetic diversity and Leaf Area Index performed better than did the other indices, encouraging the increased use of these indices for upscale monitoring activities. Consistent indicators across distinct projects highlight the importance of maximizing tree diversity and canopy closure in rehabilitation projects to increase biodiversity gains within Impact Mitigation Hierarchy.

TI  - ORGANIC MATTER FRACTIONS AND QUALITY OF THE SURFACE LAYER OF A CONSTRUCTED AND VEGETATED SOIL AFTER COAL MINING. II - PHYSICAL COMPARTMENTS AND CARBON MANAGEMENT INDEX
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils constructed after mining often have low carbon (C) stocks and low quality of organic matter (OM). Cover crops are decisive for the recovery process of these stocks, improving the quality of constructed soils. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of cover crops on total organic C (TOC) stocks, C distribution in physical fractions of OM and the C management index (CMI) of a soil constructed after coal mining. The experiment was initiated in 2003 with six treatments: Hemarthria altissima (T1), Paspalum notatum (T2), Cynodon dactylon (T3), Urochloa brizantha (T4), bare constructed soil (T5), and natural soil (T6). Soil samples were collected in 2009 from the 0.00-0.03 m layer, and the TOC and C stocks in the physical particle size fractions (carbon in the coarse fraction - CCF, and mineral-associated carbon - MAC) and density fractions (free light fraction - FLF; occluded light fraction - OLF, and heavy fraction - HF) of OM were determined. The CMI components: carbon pool index (CPI), lability (L) and lability index (LI) were estimated by both fractionation methods. No differences were observed between TOC, CCF and MAC stocks. The lowest C stocks in FLF and OLF fractions were presented by T2, 0.86 and 0.61 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The values of TOC stock, C stock in physical fractions and CMI were intermediate, greater than T5 and lower than T6 in all treatments, indicating the partial recovery of soil quality. As a result of the better adaptation of the species Hemarthria and Brizantha, resulting in greater accumulation of labile organic material, the CPI, L, LI and CMI values were higher in these treatments, suggesting a greater potential of these species for recovery of constructed soils.

TI  - Financial assessment, carbon stock and methane mitigation by trees in silvopastoral systems in the Pampa biome
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to estimate the most profitable management regimes and the potential for mitigating greenhouse gases by the growth of trees in silvopastoral systems with eucalyptus established in natural grasslands in areas of family ranchers, in the region of Bage (RS). Data were collected on growth and forest production in silvopastoral systems located in 15 rural properties, surveying the implementation costs, and the dimensions and value of the forest assortments practiced in the region. The plantations were stratified by genetic material, initial planting spacing and soil type and, after that, the simulation was performed with the aid of SisILPFE.dunnii and SisILPFeucalipto software. The definition of the best management regime was obtained by calculating the Annualized Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), using the Planin software. For the most profitable management regime, the calculation of the mitigation of greenhouse gases was carried out following the conditions for obtaining the Carbon Neutral Meat protocol. It was estimated that management regimes with thinning and a rotation age between 14 and 18 years for the best and worst sites, respectively, have greater profitability and potential to mitigate methane emissions from cattle. The stocking rate neutralized by trees has the potential to be higher than the stocking rate commonly used in native pastures in the Pampa, generating a carbon surplus that could be used to remunerate cattle breeders for environmental services.

TI  - Impact of biochar on nitrous oxide emissions from upland rice
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to assess the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from soil amended with biochar in the culture of upland rice. The experiment was conducted in the field in a Cerrado Haplic Plinthosol under randomized block experimental design. The treatments consisted of fertilization with 100 kg N ha(-1) split into two applications, 60% at sowing and 40% at 45 days after crop emergence, combined with four doses of biochar (0, 8, 16 and 32 Mg ha(-1)), with four replications. The application of N and the emission of N2O, moisture retention and soil temperature, respiration (C-CO2), microbial biomass carbon in the soil (C-SMB), total nitrogen (TN), pH and agronomic efficiency in N use (AENu) were evaluated five years after the application of biochar. There was a significant correlation of the application of biochar with moisture retention (r = 0.94**), N2O emission (r = 0.86**) and soil pH (r = 0.65*), and N2O emissions showed a positive correlation (p < 0.05) with soil moisture (r = 0.77**) and pH (r = 0.66*). Thus the highest N2O emissions were observed shortly after N fertilization and in the treatments with 32 Mg ha(-1) of biochar. Despite the higher N2O emissions from the application of 32 Mg ha(-1) of biochar, the emission factor was lower (0.81%) than the maximum recommended by the IPCC. The higher N2O emissions with application of biochar are offset by more efficient use of N and consequently the possibility of reduction of applied doses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Functional diversity of bacterial genes associated with aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in anthropogenic dark earth of Amazonia
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the catabolic gene diversity for the bacterial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in anthropogenic dark earth of Amazonia (ADE) and their biochar (BC). Functional diversity analyses in ADE soils can provide information on how adaptive microorganisms may influence the fertility of soils and what is their involvement in biogeochemical cycles. For this, clone libraries containing the gene encoding for the alpha subunit of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (alpha-A RH D bacterial gene) were constructed, totaling 800 clones. These libraries were prepared from samples of an ADE soil under two different land uses, located at the Caldeirao Experimental Station secondary forest (SF) and agriculture (AG)-, and the biochar (SF_BC and AG_BC, respectively). Heterogeneity estimates indicated greater diversity in BC libraries; and Venn diagrams showed more unique operational protein clusters (OPC) in the SF_BC library than the ADE soil, which indicates that specific metabolic processes may occur in biochar. Phylogenetic analysis showed unidentified dioxygenases in ADE soils. Libraries containing functional gene encoding for the alpha subunit of the aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARHD) gene from biochar show higher diversity indices than those of ADE under secondary forest and agriculture.

TI  - Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations trapped from soils under agroforestry systems in the Western Amazon
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is an important grain-producing legume that can forego nitrogen fertilization by establishing an efficient symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Although inoculating strains have already been selected for this species, little is known about the genotypic and symbiotic diversity of native rhizobia. Recently, Bradyrhizobium has been shown to be the genus most frequently trapped by cowpea in agricultural soils of the Amazon region. We investigated the genetic and symbiotic diversity of 148 bacterial strains with different phenotypic and cultural properties isolated from the nodules of the trap species cowpea, which was inoculated with samples from soils under agroforestry systems from the western Amazon. Sixty non-nodulating strains indicated a high frequency of endophytic strains in the nodules. The 88 authenticated strains had varying symbiotic efficiency. The SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) index (indirect measurement of chlorophyll content) was more efficient at evaluating the contribution of symbiotic N-2-fixation than shoot dry matter under axenic conditions. Cowpea-nodulating bacteria exhibited a high level of genetic diversity, with 68 genotypes identified by BOX-PCR. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed a predominance of the genus Bradyrhizobium, which accounted for 70 % of all strains sequenced. Other genera identified were Rhizobium, Ochrobactrum, Paenibacillus, Bosea, Bacillus, Enterobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. These results support the promiscuity of cowpea and demonstrate the high genetic and symbiotic diversity of rhizobia in soils under agroforestry systems, with some strains exhibiting potential for use as inoculants. The predominance of Bradyrhizobium in land uses with different plant communities and soil characteristics reflects the adaptation of this genus to the Amazon region.

TI  - Sampling parasitoid wasps (Insecta, Hymenoptera) in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present Hymenoptera parasitoid family composition in a cacao agroforestry system, compare it among strata within the system, and evaluate three Malaise trap designs (yellow intercept, duplicated width and bottom addition), to test if: (1) new trap designs increase number of captured families; (2) number of families differ among strata; (3) stratum interferes in number of families captured by each trap type. Our data refer to only eight traps, with no actual replication of the combination of trap design with trap location; therefore, to make possible the statistical test of the hypotheses, we considered number of families captured per day as response variable, and included day as covariate to avoid pseudoreplication. We captured 9700 individuals, in 30 families. All trap adaptations increased number of families collected per day, when compared to standard Malaise trap. Most captures were made by yellow intercept and duplicated width traps. There was a significant interaction of trap type with stratum. Number of families captured per day differed among strata, the highest number of families occurring in cacao gap.

TI  - Use of biochar and crude glycerin as additives in the composting of slaughterhouse waste in static piles
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of biochar and crude glycerin as additives in N retention throughout the composting of cattle slaughterhouse waste in static piles receiving forced aeration. There were five treatments (control, biochar accounting for 5 and 10%, and glycerin accounting for 5 and 10%, both at total solids) and four times (20, 50, 70 and 90 days of composting). The slaughterhouse waste was composted with a bulking agent at a ratio of 3:1, and the mixtures of waste and the tested additives were placed in nylon bags. The piles reached thermophilic temperatures soon after the process started and following turnings. The reductions of volatile solids, carbon, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin were not influenced by the additives, resulting in averages of 69.1, 67.1, 62.1, 51.6 and 35.3%, respectively. The control showed greater N losses (58.38%), compared to the treatments with additives. The inclusions of biochar yielded an average loss of 48.47% N, while 10% of glycerin resulted in the lowest N losses (44.83%). The use of biochar and glycerin as additives in the composting of slaughterhouse waste is recommended in order to decrease N losses and improve the concentration of nutrients, without compromising the biodegradation of organic components.

TI  - CAULIFLOWER CULTrVARS ASSOCIATED WITH Urochloa decumbens STRAW MULCH IN INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT
T2  - PLANTA DANINHA
M3  - Article
AB  - In vegetable farming, the reduction in the use of herbicides has been an important factor in the definition of the production system. The objective of this research was to evaluate crop yield of cauliflower cultivars grown on Urochloa decumbens straw mulch, as well as the effect of the association between straw and cultivars on weed management. The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme: two managements (with or without U. decumbens straw mulch) and four cauliflower cultivars (Barcelona, Bromus, Julia and Lisblanc). The experiment used a randomized block design with four replicates. There was no interference of straw mulch on crop yield of cauliflower cultivars. Hybrids Barcelona and Julia presented yields of 22.0 and 23.9 t ha(-1), respectively, and they did not differ from each other. The Bromus and Lisblanc materials did not adapt to the edaphoclimatic conditions of the region, which resulted in reduced cultural control and high weed emergence after weeding. U. decumbens straw had high control of the weed community (581.2 pls m(-2) - without straw and 8.3 pls m(-2) - with straw). It is concluded that the U. decumbens straw as mulch is an effective tool in integrated management of weeds in cauliflower crops, without interfering with crop yield, and its potential to control weed community density is approximately 98.6%, at 22 days after transplanting. The adaptability of the cauliflower cultivar to the region has a high impact on weed management.

TI  - Biochar improves growth and physiology of Swietenia macrophylla king in contaminated soil by copper
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of acai seed waste from the commercial and extractive exploitation of the Euterpe oleraceae palm tree is a serious problem that contributes to environmental contamination and production of greenhouse gases, a fact that suggests the need for an environmentally correct destination for this waste produced on a large scale. To this end, this study was conducted to evaluate the potential of aca & iacute; seed biochar (BCA) in mitigating the toxic effects of copper in Brazilian mahogany plants, analyzing biometrics and gas exchange. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with five blocks, in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, corresponding to the control (without Cu) and three concentration of Cu (200, 400, and 600 mg Cu kg(-1)) and three levels of BCA (0%, 5% and 10%) proportional to the amount of soil in the pots, totaling sixty experimental units. The use of 5% BCA in soils contaminated with up to 200 mg kg(-1) Cu promoted biometric increase (height, diameter, number of leaves), maintaining gas exchange (photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal carbon and internal/external carbon), and consequently, maintaining water use efficiency in plants under abiotic stress, resulting in plant growth. The findings of this study allow us to indicate the use of biochar in remediating and improving the growth of plants grown in copper-contaminated soils. The production of biochar from acai seeds is an ecologically sustainable alternative, because it reduces its accumulation on public roads and contributes to reducing soil pollution. In the context of public policies, biochar production could be a source of income in the context of the bioeconomy and circular economy practiced in the Amazon, because it is produced in large quantities.

AB  - Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance well-being in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region.

TI  - Farmers' assessment of the use value of agrobiodiversity in complex cocoa agroforestry systems in central Cameroon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems in humid tropical areas are complex multispecies cropping systems whose value for farmers is often hard to assess. We present the findings of a participatory assessment that we applied to cocoa agroforestry systems. This assessment, adapted from the pebble distribution method, was used to quantify the value given by farmers to each species of their cocoa agroforestry system according to the attributed uses. A tree inventory in 50 cocoa agroforests was carried out in central Cameroon. Overall, 122 non-cocoa tree species were inventoried. The mean species richness was 23 species per plot and the mean Shannon index was 2.42, for a mean density of 180 non-cocoa trees ha(-1) and 1,511 cocoa trees ha(-1). Cocoa farmers defined seven different uses for tree species, including Theobroma cacao. 81 % of the species (including cocoa trees) had one to seven uses whereas the highest use value was given to T. cacao, with a mean score of 23.6 %. Then, in descending order, the 10 non-cocoa species with the highest use values were Dacryodes edulis, Persea americana, Elaeis guineensis, Citrus sinensis, Mangifera indica, Milicia excelsa, Cola nitida, Citrus sp., Ricinodendron heudelotii, and Terminalia superba. The frequency of non-cocoa species was significantly and positively correlated with their use value (R-2 = 0.914). Our results showed that technical innovations designed to improve cocoa agroforestry systems should take into account farmers' knowledge to propose them systems so as to be able to more effectively address their expectations.

TI  - Improved water and ions dynamics in a clayey soil amended with different types of agro-industrial waste biochar
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar is a beneficial amendment for fine-textured soils. In addition, the interaction of biochar particles with soil components influences the dynamics of water and ions, which is particularly important to remediate salt-affected soils. We investigated the effect of sugarcane bagasse (SB), orange bagasse (OB), and corncobs (CB) biochar on water movement and ion leaching in clayey soil. Non-amended soil (CT) column and soil amended with gypsum (CTG) served as controls. Water infiltration, water flow rate, cumulative leached cations, anions, and exchangeable cations (Ca2+ , Mg2+, K+, and Na+) were determined. Biochar increased the water infiltration and water flow rate by 80% and 71%, respectively. The SB and CB treatments increased the ion removal from the soil by 48%, whereas the OB increased the removal by 19%. The OB's lower surface area and water holding capacity likely influenced its performance. Biochar reduced the Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration on the soil exchange complex by 44% and 76%, respectively, and increased K+ by 233%. However, the most exciting result was the reduction of exchangeable Na+, 90% in the SB and CB treatments and 50% in the OB treatment. Considering that a high concentration of Na+ on the exchange complex contributes to soil structural degradation, biochar application, especially SB and CB, can potentially improve soil quality and mitigate salt-affected soils.

TI  - Distribution parameters of large mammals and conservation management in an Afrotropical forest landscape and biodiversity hotspot
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Though there is consent that poaching is an important driver of wildlife declines in many African forests, we lack a deeper understanding of the factors behind population patterns in Afrotropical landscapes to inform conservation management. We surveyed line transects in four Cameroonian sites of different protection status in 2013/2014, namely Korup National Park, Banyang Mbo Wildlife Reserve, one timber concession and a section of an unprotected agroforestry matrix, and used data from 2007 for trend assessment. We used GLMs to identify predictors for mammal distribution based on a set of variables. While species compositions showed complex trend patterns, it is noteworthy that chimpanzee and elephant abundances declined significantly in the Banyang Mbo Wildlife Reserve. Although landscape management type affected the distribution of most mammal species, anthropogenic or environmental variables were strong predictors. Chimpanzee, elephant and drill abundances were higher at a larger distance to settlements. Vegetation density positively affected a number of species, including chimpanzee and red colobus. Several species were more abundant in rough terrain, probably because of reduced poaching. Our results suggest that protected areas in Southwest Cameroon had a mitigating effect on wildlife declines, mainly due to their remoteness and habitat quality, rather than management interventions.Bien qu'il soit admis que le braconnage est un facteur important du declin de la faune dans de nombreuses forets africaines, nous n'avons pas une comprehension plus approfondie des facteurs a l'origine des modeles de population dans les paysages afro-tropicaux, afin d'informer la gestion de la conservation. Nous avons etudie des transects lineaires dans quatre sites camerounais de differents statuts de protection en 2013/2014, notamment le parc national de Korup, la reserve de faune de Banyang Mbo, une concession forestiere et une section d'une matrice agroforestiere non protegee, et nous avons utilise les donnees de 2007 pour evaluer les tendances. Nous avons utilise des GLM pour identifier les indicateurs de la distribution des mammiferes sur la base d'un ensemble de variables. Si la composition des especes presentait des tendances complexes, il convient de noter que l'abondance des chimpanzes et des elephants a diminue de maniere considerable dans la reserve de faune de Banyang Mbo. Bien que le type de gestion du paysage ait affecte la distribution de la plupart des especes de mammiferes, les variables anthropogeniques ou environnementales etaient des indicateurs importants. Les abondances de chimpanzes, d'elephants et de forets etaient plus elevees a une plus grande distance des habitations. La densite de la vegetation a eu un effet positif sur un certain nombre d'especes, notamment le chimpanze et le colobe rouge. Plusieurs especes etaient plus abondantes sur les terrains accidentes, probablement en raison du braconnage limite. Nos resultats suggerent que les zones protegees dans le sud-ouest du Cameroun ont eu un effet attenuant sur le declin de la faune, principalement en raison de leur eloignement et de la qualite de l'habitat, plutot que des interventions de gestion.

TI  - Use of cover crops in the southern Amazon region: What is the impact on soil physical quality?
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing cover crops during the rotation system and off-season can provide numerous benefits to the agricultural system, such as increased carbon stock and improved soil aeration. However, in the southern Amazon region, owing to the hot and humid climate, the cover crops used in agricultural production systems may not have the same beneficial effects in the Cerrado region. This makes it necessary to introduce and study new species of cover crops that have the potential to improve soil quality. The objective of this study was to compare, over time, the dry matter production of eight cover crops, and the effects of their cultivation on the physical attributes of the soil in the southern Amazon region. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with analyzes carried out over the 3 years of the experiment, in three replicates. The treatments were composed of eight cover crops: crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), velvet-bean (Mucuna aterrima), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), ruziziensis grass (Urochloa ruziziensis), brizantha grass (Urochloa brizantha), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), and finger millet (Eleusine coracana), and three evaluation years (2014, 2015, and 2016). The cover crops used in the experiment were selected based on their adaptation to the growing conditions and because they have characteristics of agricultural interest. In addition, cover crops chosen can be used in soybean-maize rotation systems, soybean-maize succession systems, as well as in agriculture-livestock integration systems through integrated cultivation systems. Using undisturbed soil samples, were analyzed the physical variables: porosity, mechanical resistance to root penetration and water retention. Pore size distribution was calculated using the first derivative of the equation of van Genuchten and S index was determined by the angle of inclination of the soil water retention curve inflection point. The results show that leguminous and grassy cover crops act differently under physical soil attributes over time. The results indicated that the cultivation of grasses, such as P. glaucum, increased the values of macroporosity (0.18 m(3) m(-3)) in the 0.00-0.10 m layer at the end of the third year of cultivation, consequently, reduced the value of soil density (up to 1.14 Mg m(-3)) and mechanical resistance to root penetration (up to 1.77 MPa). The largest accumulation of dry matter was obtained with the cultivation of U. brizantha, which consequently proved to be the best cultivation option in the off-season in the southern Amazon region. The study provides a better understanding of the influence of cover crops on the physical attributes of the soil, which will contribute to making the correct recommendation of cover crops that can improve the physical properties of the soil in agricultural frontier regions in the southern Amazon rainforest.

TI  - Management of liquid swine manure: impact on mineral nitrogen dynamics and corn yield
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The agronomic efficiency of liquid swine manure (LSM) depends on the use of strategies to mitigate nitrogen (N) losses after its application to the soil, and thus preserve its fertilizing potential. In order to evaluate the injection of LSM into the soil and the addition of a nitrification inhibitor, as ways to increase its efficiency as a N source to the corn crop in the no-tillage system, an experiment was carried out under an Aluminofferic Red Latosol. The used treatments were: one control, surface application (total area) of LSM, injection of LSM in furrows, surface application (total area) of LSM + dicyandiamide (DCD), injection of LSM + DCD in furrows, and mineral fertilization. The mineral N in the soil and number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, 1,000-grain mass and grain yield for corn were evaluated. One day after the application of the treatments, the recovery of the mineral N in the soil with the injection of LSM exceeded by 10 kg ha(-1) that observed with the superficial application. With DCD, the recovery of anionic forms (NO2- and NO3-) in the soil was lower in the first 20 days after the application, with the change in the N dynamics caused by DCD resulting in a higher content of mineral N at 30 days after sowing. The transformation rate for the anionic forms of mineral N in the soil is reduced with the addition of DCD. The injection of LSM with DCD does not differ from mineral fertilization, in terms of corn grain yield.

TI  - Inoculation with Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria and Nitrogen Doses Improves Wheat Productivity and Nitrogen Use Efficiency
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is one of the staple foods of the global population due to its adaptability to a wide range of environments. Nitrogen is one of the crucial limiting factors in wheat production and is considered a challenge to food security. Therefore, sustainable agricultural technologies such as seed inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPBs) can be adopted to promote biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) for higher crop productivity. In this context, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen fertilization and seed inoculations with Azospirillum brasilense, Bacillus subtilis and A. brasilense + B. subtilis on agronomic and yield attributes, grain yield, grain N accumulation, N use efficiency and applied N recovery in Brazilian Cerrado, which consists of gramineous woody savanna. The experiment was carried out in two cropping seasons in Rhodic Haplustox soil under a no-tillage system. The experiment was designed in a randomized complete block in a 4 x 5 factorial scheme, with four replications. The treatments consisted of four seed inoculations (control-without inoculation, inoculation with A. brasilense, B. subtilis and A. brasilense + B. subtilis) under five N doses (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha(-1), applied from urea) at the wheat tillering stage. Seed co-inoculation with A. brasilense + B. subtilis increased grain N accumulation, number of spikes m(-1), grains spike(-1) and grain yield of wheat in an irrigated no-tillage system of tropical savannah, regardless of the applied N doses. Nitrogen fertilization at a dose of 80 kg ha(-1) significantly increased grain N accumulation and number of grains spikes(-1) and nitrogen use efficiency. Recovery of applied N was increased with inoculation of B. subtilis and co-inoculation of A. brasilense + B. subtilis at increasing N doses. Therefore, N fertilization can be reduced by the inclusion of co-inoculation with A. brasilense + B. subtilis in the cultivation of winter wheat under a no-tillage system of Brazilian Cerrado.

TI  - Ammonia volatilization and Sporosarcina genus abundance in an Oxisol enriched with urea, compost and biochar
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) loss through ammonia (NH3) volatilization (AV) has been a major agricultural and environmental concern. AV reduction is one of the main challenges to increase N-use efficiency and decrease environmental risks. The present research aimed to evaluate the effects of the addition of urea (URE) amended with compost (COM) and biochar (BC) to soil on the biochemical process of AV and the soil-urea microsite bacterial community composition. Soil microcosm assays were performed with the addition of URE, COM, and BC and their combi-nation URE-COM and URE-BC under incubation conditions for 28 days. AV decreased significantly only in the URE-BC, reducing the N loss by approximately 40% compared to that in the URE. The results revealed that URE hydrolysis occurred within 5 days of incubation, and urease activity increased in all treatments with urea. Urease activity decreased significantly in the URE-COM and URE-BC. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a high abundance of reads classified to Sporosarcina, suggesting that organisms belonging to this genus might play an important ecological role in the soil-urea environmental niche. There was no effect of the COM or BC on the abundance of this genus or on the bacterial community composition at 5 and 28 days. This study shows that the addition of an acidic biochar amendment with urea is the key pathway to reduce N loss through AV.

TI  - Co-production of agroecological innovations to improve sustainability in South American fruit farms
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification and expansion are the main drivers of biodiversity loss that continue to increase this century, especially in South America. International markets and global policy provide incentives and frameworks to address this, but these are unlikely to be effective unless farmers on the ground are enabled and motivated to respond to them by developing long-term solutions that fit their production systems and local contexts. Here, we use a multi-actor transdisciplinary approach to co-design and test agroecological innovations suitable for intensive, exporting South American fruit farms. We focus on highly biodiverse regions experiencing habitat loss in the Mediterranean and dry tropical forest regions of Chile and Brazil, respectively. The innovations were designed to support local biodiversity without compromising productivity or quality. Fourteen farmers participated throughout the project, covering a total of 4178 ha of intensive table grape, mango and cherry production. All were under pressure from buyers to report action on biodiversity. Farmers worked with researchers and industry representatives through an iterative process of dialogues and workshops to select, co-design and implement three agroecological innovations: perches for birds of prey, cover crops and native hedgerows. Farmers became engaged in monitoring their effectiveness and redesigning them to suit local contexts. We develop an extensive set of resources for ongoing dissemination, including an online sustainability metric to report the practices carried out. Eight farms continued to implement at least one agroecological innovation beyond the end of the project, motivated by its fit to their management system and their ability to report positive actions in their supply chains. Policy implications. Our model of knowledge co-production demonstrates how transdisciplinary research in agriculture, fully localised in a particular food-producing context, can enable farmers in the global South to engage with biodiversity conservation in response to top-down market signals incentivising sustainability. We argue that many top-down effort to enhance the sustainability of food supply chains, whether through market incentives, voluntary codes or trade regulations, requires locally based knowledge co-production, in which multiple stakeholders from agriculture and the food industry can benefit from working with locally based researchers.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.La intensificacion y expansion de la agricultura son los principales motores de la perdida de biodiversidad durante este siglo, especialmente en Sudamerica. Los mercados internacionales y la politica global ofrecen incentivos y marcos para abordar esto, pero es poco probable que sean efectivas a menos que los agricultores esten capacitados y motivados para responder a ellos, desarrollando soluciones a largo plazo que se adapten a sus sistemas de produccion y contextos locales. En este trabajo, utilizamos un enfoque transdisciplinario de multiples actores para co-disenar y probar innovaciones agroecologicas adecuadas para predios de produccion fruticola intensivas y exportadoras de Sudamerica. Nos enfocamos en regiones de gran biodiversidad que experimentan perdida de habitat, en las regiones mediterranea y de bosque tropical seco de Chile y Brasil, respectivamente. Las innovaciones se disenaron para apoyar la biodiversidad local sin comprometer la productividad o calidad de la produccion. Catorce agricultores participaron en todo el proyecto, abarcando un total de 4.178 ha de produccion intensiva de uva de mesa, mango y cereza. Todos estaban mandatados por los compradores para que informaran de las medidas adoptadas en materia de biodiversidad. Los agricultores trabajaron con investigadores y representantes de la industria a traves de un proceso iterativo de dialogos y talleres para seleccionar, co-disenar e implementar tres innovaciones agroecologicas: perchas para aves rapaces, cultivos de cobertura y setos nativos. Los agricultores se involucraron en monitorear su efectividad y redisenarlos para adaptarlos a los contextos locales Desarrollamos un amplio conjunto de recursos para la difusion continua, incluida una metrica de sostenibilidad en linea para informar sobre las practicas implementadas. Ocho predios siguieron aplicando al menos una innovacion agroecologica una vez finalizado el proyecto, motivadas por su adecuacion a su sistema de gestion y su capacidad para informar de acciones positivas en sus cadenas de suministro. Implicancia politica. Nuestro modelo de coproduccion de conocimiento demuestra como la investigacion transdisciplinar en agricultura, localizada en un contexto particular de produccion de alimentos, puede permitir a los agricultores del Sur comprometerse con la conservacion de la biodiversidad en respuesta a las senales del mercado que incentivan la sostenibilidad. Sostenemos que muchos esfuerzo de arriba hacia abajo para mejorar la sostenibilidad de las cadenas de suministro de alimentos, ya sea a traves de incentivos de mercado, codigos voluntarios o regulaciones comerciales, requiere una coproduccion de conocimientos basado en el lugar, en la que multiples partes interesadas de la agricultura y la industria alimentaria pueden beneficiarsr al trabajar con investigadores locales.A intensificacao e a expansao agricola sao os principais fatores relacionados a perda de biodiversidade, que continua a aumentar neste seculo, especialmente na America do Sul. Os mercados internacionais e o cenariopolitico global fornecem incentivos e estrutura para lidar com este problema, mas e improvavel que estes sejam eficazes a menos que os agricultores estejam capacitados e motivados a desenvolver solucoes de longo prazo que se adaptem aos seu sistema de producao e contexto local. Aqui, utilizamos a abordagem transdisciplinar envonvedo multiplos atores para co-desenvolver e testar inovacoes agroecologicas adequadas a fazendas de fruticultura intensiva e exportadoras da America do Sul. Nos enfocamos areas com elevada biodiversidade, atingidas por perda de habitat, situadas em regiao mediterranea ede floresta tropical seca no Chile e no Brasil, respetivamente. As inovacoes foram concebidas para apoiar a biodiversidade local sem comprometer a produtividade ou a qualidade. Catorze agricultores participaram do projeto, abrangendo area total de 4.178 ha com producao intensiva de uva de mesa, manga e cereja. Todos estavam sob pressao dos compradores para apresentarem acoesrelacionadas a biodiversidade. Os agricultores trabalharam com pesquisadores e representantes da industria atraves de um processo iterativo de dialogo e grupo de trabalho, para selecionar, co-desenvolver e implementar tres inovacoes agroecologicas: poleiros para aves de rapina, cultivo de cobertura e faixas com plantas nativas. Os agricultores empenharam-se em monitorar a eficacia e desenvolver adaptacoes para adequa-las ao contexto local. Desenvolvemos um conjunto amplo de recursos para divulgacao continua, incluindo uma metrica de sustentabilidade online para comunicar as praticas realizadas. Oito agricultores continuaram a implementar pelo menos uma inovacao agroecologica apos a finalizacao do projeto, motivados pela sua adequacao ao sistema demanejo e por representar acao positiva para a cadeia de abastecimento. Implicacoes para as politicas. O nosso modelo de coproducao de conhecimento demonstra como a pesquisatransdisciplinar na agricultura, situada totalmente em um contexto particular de producao de alimentos, pode permitir que os agricultores do Sul global se envolvam na conservacao da biodiversidade em resposta a sinais de mercado, de cima para baixo, que incentivam a sustentabilidade. Argumentamos que muitos esforcos, de cima para baixo, para melhorar a sustentabilidade das cadeias de abastecimento alimentar, seja atraves de incentivos de mercado, codigos voluntarios ou regulamentos comerciais, requer a coproducao de conhecimentos de base local, na qual varios tomadores de decisao, da agricultura e da industria alimentar, podem se beneficiar trabalhando com pesquisadores locais.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

TI  - Latitudinal distribution, co-occurring tree species and structural diversity of the threatened palm Borassus aethiopum (Arecaceae) in Benin, West Africa
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims - Borassus aethiopum Mart, is a wild palm species with high subsistence importance in West Africa. Extensive agriculture and overharvesting of its stem and fruits for multiple uses have caused a decrease of its natural populations in its native range. For conservation purposes, the distribution, abundance and structural diversity of the species were investigated across ten phytodistricts in three biogeographical zones in Benin. Two hypotheses were tested (i) tree floristic composition of B. aethiopum natural habitat changes with phytodistricts and (ii) structural diversity of B. aethiopum changes with phytodistricts, both as potential adaptation strategies to changing ecological conditions.Methods - Geographical coordinates of the species occurrence were recorded. Abundance was assessed in 852 one-ha plots. Structural diversity was studied using structural indices on data from ecological inventories and neighbourhood survey in 70 one-ha plots.Key results - The two hypotheses proved true. B. aethiopum was found in all phytodistricts but with strong variations in abundance. Overall, floristic composition of its natural habitats showed dissimilarities among phytodistricts. Three main vegetation types sheltered B. aethiopum: mixed grass and shrub savannas, savanna woodlands and woodlands, all of which were found in gallery forest landscapes. The density of B. aethiopum was lower in grass savannas but larger, shorter and distant individuals were found there than in savanna woodlands and woodlands. In the latter vegetation types, its density was high with thin, tall and closely spaced individuals. B. aethiopum tolerates mingling with several other tree species but increased mingling tends to lead to positive differentiation in diameter and height.Conclusions - Borassus aethiopum is a sun-demanding species and establishes successful populations in various ecological conditions. It could be mixed with other tree species in tree plantations and modern agroforestry systems as long as water requirements are met. However, it would be preferable that the species is associated with shade tolerant or medium sun-demanding species.

TI  - Assessment of biodiversity goods for the sustainable development of the chagra in an indigenous community of the Colombian Amazon: local values of crops
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The chagra is the agroforestry system adapted to the characteristics of the Amazon region. Recently, there has been a reported loss of biodiversity and traditional knowledge associated with the chagras. This paper characterizes the cultivators, exploring knowledge and expressed value perception in the context of the Amazonian chagra of an indigenous community; also, this prioritizes species, under the optics of commercial opportunity. Methods A semi-structured instrument was applied to 14 volunteers, asking about marketing preferences and use values of the species; later, a floristic inventory and prioritization workshop was developed. Results Sixty-two percent of the participants were 50 years or older at the time of the interview. Open conversations showed that traditional knowledge is a matter of practice; and is maintained mainly by the older "grandfathers". Thirty-eight species, belonging to 28 different families, were reported, showing considerable diversity. Seventy-nine percent of the participants consider the Leticia market and sales to tourists as the main marketing scenarios. Conclusions The Ziora-Amena community centralizes the handling of chagras in the community's older adults, who transmit their traditional knowledge to new generations through oral tradition. Indicators of preference, use, and abundance highlight the food species. The perception of the trade stakeholder encourages research and development of endemic species, with health properties or ingredients for industry, which represent an opportunity of high added value for the region.

TI  - The role of local and regional processes in shaping dung beetle communities in tropical forest plantations in Borneo
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine whether rain forest dung beetle species found in plantations in Sabah, northern Borneo, tend to be endemic or geographically widespread. In addition, linear regressions of abundance vs. distance from a major river in primary rain forest are calculated to see if species found in plantation forest show affinity to one specific biotope (riverine vs. interior forest) in their natural habitat. Results show that 14 of the 40 species recorded from plantations are endemic to Borneo. Only edge-specialist endemic species are found in plantation forest, with no interior-forest specialists recorded. Data suggest that endemic species that are adapted to more exposed conditions in primary rain forest, such as riverine species, can in some instances tolerate man-made habitats. Twenty-nine species (+/- SE 4.0) per transect are recorded from plantation transects, whereas 44.2 (+/- 1.7 SE) are recorded in primary rain forest. As species richness is much lower in plantations than natural forest, implying loss of biodiversity, we conclude that measures of biogeographic distinctiveness, whereby endemic species confer higher values, may be misleading unless they take into account edge-affinity. Local- as well as regional-distributional data may therefore be needed to interpret correctly patterns of species assemblages in derived forest ecosystems.

TI  - Voisin Rational Grazing as a Sustainable Alternative for Livestock Production
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary To meet current global food supply challenges, researchers and technicians are searching for alternative livestock systems that promote highly sustainable animal productivity and farm profitability, while having a positive environmental footprint. In this narrative review, we highlight one such system, Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG). VRG is a regenerative livestock farming system proposed by French scientist Andre Voisin in the 1950s and further developed in Brazil in the 1970s. VRG has been applied in many countries with vastly different ecosystems. Like other regenerative systems, VRG provides a range of ecosystem services, including negative net carbon emission, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. Because VRG is also focused on animal performance, farmers applying VRG are more resilient against the adversities confronting farmers practicing more conventional farming systems. VRG requires a paradigm shift from the farmers and thus its uptake may be hindered if there is not enough support within the community. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of VRG, along with its benefits and constraints. Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More specifically, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking. Little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of VRG benefits on animal performance or to overcome VRG limitations.

TI  - Comparative study on the proteolytic activities and storage globulins in seeds of Theobroma grandiflorum (Willd ex Spreng) Schum and Theobroma bicolor Humb Bonpl, in relation to their potential to generate chocolate-like aroma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cocoa relatives T grandiflorum (cupuacu) and T bicolor (macambo) are promising crop plants for sustainable agroforestry in the Amazon region of South America. The market for cupuacu is expanding since the fruit flesh is utilised by the foodstuffs industry. Attempts to commercialise chocolate-like wares from the seeds have failed so far because of unreliable product quality. It is not known whether this is due to an insufficient aroma potential of cupuacu seeds. We therefore investigated the proteolytic enzymes and the seed storage globulins which are both decisive for the formation of aroma precursors in cocoa. We found that the activities of the aspartic endopeptidase and the carboxypeptidase in T bicolor and T grandiflorum differed slightly from those in cocoa. The specificity of the carboxypeptidase for hydrophobic amino acids was quite similar across the three species, while the optimal pH of the T grandiflorum enzyme was lower than that of the other species. The qualitative and quantitative differences between the globulins indicate a lower maximum yield of aroma precursors in T grandiflorum and a higher maximum yield of aroma precursors in T bicolor, compared to cocoa. We conclude that the quality of chocolate-like products made from the studied cocoa relatives can be improved by adapting fermentation procedures to particular biochemical features of these seeds.

TI  - Biochar decreases dissolved organic carbon but not nitrate leaching in relation to vinasse application in a Brazilian sugarcane soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Sugarcane cultivation is associated with catchment-wide impacts related to application of vinasse, a nutrient-dense effluent with high eutrophication potential. We evaluated the potential for biochar (charcoal produced from pyrolyzed filtercake) to mitigate carbon and nutrient leaching in a cultivated Brazilian Ferralsol after vinasse application.Methods: Twelve soil columns (soil alone [S], soil with vinasse [SV], soil with vinasse and biochar [SVB], and soil with biochar [SB]) were flushed with water and then treated with water or vinasse. Samples collected via vacuum filtration were examined via UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy.Results: Biochar attenuated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching in soil (S vs. SB) as well as in relation to vinasse application (SV vs. SVB). Biochar-amended soil preferentially retained high-molecular weight, humic-like DOC species, as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy and optical indices, but did not retain low-weight amino acid-like species. Vinasse application also increased total NO3- flux, which may have been exacerbated by biochar co-application.Conclusions: Vinasse treatment strongly affects carbon and NO3- fluxes in this tropical soil. Biochar attenuated DOC leaching, likely through stabilization of complex compounds already present in soil, but did not lessen NOT fluxes. Thus, biochar amendments in vinasse application areas may decrease carbon leaching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Molecular evidence for stimulation of methane oxidation in Amazonian floodplains by ammonia-oxidizing communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia oxidation is the rate-limiting first step of nitrification and a key process in the nitrogen cycle that results in the formation of nitrite (NO2-), which can be further oxidized to nitrate (NO3-). In the Amazonian floodplains, soils are subjected to extended seasons of flooding during the rainy season, in which they can become anoxic and produce a significant amount of methane (CH4). Various microorganisms in this anoxic environment can couple the reduction of different ions, such as NO2- and NO3-, with the oxidation of CH4 for energy production and effectively link the carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, we addressed the composition of ammonium (NH4+) and NO3--and NO2--dependent CH4-oxidizing microbial communities in an Amazonian floodplain. In addition, we analyzed the influence of environmental and geochemical factors on these microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from different layers of forest and agroforest land-use systems during the flood and non-flood seasons in the floodplain of the Tocantins River, and next-generation sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons was performed, coupled with chemical characterization of the soils. We found that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more abundant than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during both flood and non-flood seasons. Nitrogen-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers (N-DAMO) from both the archaeal and bacterial domains were also found in both seasons, with higher abundance in the flood season. The different seasons, land uses, and depths analyzed had a significant influence on the soil chemical factors and also affected the abundance and composition of AOA, AOB, and N-DAMO. During the flood season, there was a significant correlation between ammonia oxidizers and N-DAMO, indicating the possible role of these oxidizers in providing oxidized nitrogen species for methanotrophy under anaerobic conditions, which is essential for nitrogen removal in these soils.

TI  - Biochar and conventional compost reduce hysteresis and increase phosphorus desorbability in iron mining waste
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus (P) fixation in the soil reduces the utilization of this element by plants and can be one of the main problems for fertilization management in soils containing Fe oxides. As a strategy to minimize the effects of P retention, organic materials, such as biochar or commercial composts, may be useful tools to maintain P availability and delay immobilization of this element in the soil, thereby benefiting, for example, the rehabilitation of areas impacted by Fe mining. The objective of this study was to evaluate the kinetics of P sorption and desorption and the hysteresis index in red mining waste from Fe mining subjected to acai biochar and commercial compost amendments. Therefore, a substrate collected from Fe mining waste piles in the Carajas Mineral Province was incubated for 30 days with acai biochar, commercial compost, and acai biochar + commercial compost at a ratio of 90 % mining waste and 10 % organic amendment (w/w). The P sorption and desorption kinetics were evaluated in a solution containing 10 mg L-1 P at times from 0.5 to 48 h; the data were modeled according to a pseudo-first-order equation considering two types of reaction sites, and the hysteresis index was obtained by the difference between the sorption and desorption isotherms. Treatment of the mining substrate with acai biochar reduced P sorption, while P desorption was increased by up to 60 % by applying biochar and/or commercial compost. Acai biochar also reduced the hysteresis of P sorption from 78 to 54.8 %, in addition to slowing P fixation in this substrate. Thus, this study showed that acai biochar and commercial compost may maximize the benefits of phosphate fertilization during the rehabilitation of areas impacted by Fe mining. However, as these composts can cause different effects on P dynamics in mining waste, their effects on other elements, such as micronutrients, whose availability may be affected, are important to be evaluated.

AB  - This paper summarises the impact of different changes (environmental, ecological, developmental) on the one hand, with the impact of control measures on the other. The former group of changes have tended to exacerbate the incidence and prevalence of vector-borne parasitic diseases while the reduced public funds available for the health sector have reduced disease surveillance systems. However, some vector control/eradication programmes have been successful. Vector control in onchocerciasis and Chagas' disease and immediate host control in Guinea worm have reduced the public health importance of these diseases. This contrasts, with malaria, where the complexity of different ecological situations and the variable vector ecology have made control difficult and epidemics frequent and unpredictable: Advances in our knowledge of how to implement and sustain insecticide-impregnated bednets which reduce morbidity and mortality in under 5-year olds will be a key issue for the coming years. In African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, where control is dependent on effective diagnosis and surveillance followed by high-cost drug treatment, the health services are faced with major challenges-lack of drug availability and diagnostics no vector control-the diseases in some areas assuming epidemic status yet health services are unable to respond. Human African trypanosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis are fatal if untreated, and require an emergency response approach. Changing vector distribution of Glossina is related to the ability of riverine flies of Glossina palpalis group to adapt to new vegetation patterns. In leishmaniasis changes have occurred in the distribution of the disease associated with development impact, urbanisation, civil unrest and changed agroforestry practice.

TI  - Symbiotic effectiveness of Bradyrhizobium ingae in promoting growth of Inga edulis Mart. seedlings
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Inga edulis Mart. is a leguminous tree adapted to acidic and low-fertility soils that establishes symbioses with nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria. The identification of effective bacteria in biological N fixation may bolster the use of I. edulis in degraded or modified areas and agroforestry systems. Therefore, the aims of this study were evaluation of the symbiotic effectiveness of eight strains of the Bradyrhizobium genus native to Roraima in Inga edulis plants, and in vitro evaluation of the ability of the eight strains of Bradyrhizobium to develop plant growth-promoting characteristics. Determination of symbiotic effectiveness was carried out via three experiments: the first in a greenhouse in pots with a sterile substrate; the second in a greenhouse in pots containing non-sterile soil; and the third in a nursery in bags with a non-sterile substrate. Twelve treatments were evaluated: inoculation with eight strains of Bradyrhizobium ingae (ERR 490, ERR 492, ERR 493, ERR 494T, ERR 496, ERR 497, ERR 498, and ERR 569); inoculation with two strains indicated for Inga marginata, BR 6609 and BR 6610 (positive controls); no inoculation but with mineral N; and neither inoculation nor mineral N. All of the experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replicates. The first experiment was conducted for 60 days, and the other experiments were conducted for 100 days. For all of the experiments, the number of nodules, nodule dry matter, root dry matter, shoot dry matter, number of leaflets, plant height, stem diameter, total N in the shoots, root/shoot dry matter ratio, Dickson's quality index, relative effectiveness, and the Pearson correlation between the variables under study were evaluated. The strains were also evaluated by their ability to solubilize calcium and aluminum phosphates and to produce indolic compounds. The results showed that B. ingae strains were effective in biological N fixation, especially the ERR 493, ERR 498, and ERR 569 strains. These strains increased the production of shoot dry matter and total N and exhibited relative effectiveness higher than 100 % in all of the experiments. The B. ingae strains were also able to solubilize calcium and aluminum phosphates, despite their synthesis of indolic compounds. Thus, the strains of B. ingae can be used for inoculation in the production of I. edulis seedlings.

TI  - Variable responses of the depth of tree nitrogen uptake to pruning and competition
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees in cropped fields may improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency by intercepting leached N, but crop yield will be reduced if the trees compete strongly with crops for N. Ideal trees for intercropping will take up N from deeper soil layers not accessed by the crop species. Spatiotemporal aspects of tree nitrogen capture niches were investigated within a hedgerow intercropping system by placing 1 5 N at three depths and monitoring 15 N uptake by trees pruned either 25 or 4 days before application of 15 N. Trees with contrasting rooting patterns (Gliricidia sepium L. and Peltophorum dasyrrachis (Miq.) Kurz) were grown in mixed hedgerows and intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.). Neither species showed significant N uptake during the 5-14 days after pruning, even though some shoot regrowth occurred during this time. Mean topsoil (0-5 cm depth) root length density of G. sepium was 520% greater than that of P. dasyrrachis, whereas total root length (0-100 cm depth) of G. sepium was only 450% greater. On average, G. sepium recovered 15 times as much 15 N as P. dasyrrachis, following application of N-15 at 5 cm depth, but the two species recovered a similar amount following application at 80 cm depth, suggesting that P. dasyrrachis had better niche complementarity with shallow rooting crops. However, both species showed strong plasticity in vertical N uptake pattern in response to competition from establishing maize plants. The species differed in their response: N uptake activity by G. sepium shifted down the soil profile in response to increasing competition from a growing maize crop (uptake from 80 cm depth changed from 4 to 9% of uptake from 5 cm depth), whereas N uptake by P. dasyrrachis became relatively shallow (uptake from 80 cm depth changed from 305 to 25% of uptake from 5 cm depth). Niche avoidance and increased competitiveness within the topsoil represent alternative responses to competition. The response displayed may be related to soil fertility in the species' natural habitats.

TI  - Multi-year double cropping biochar field trials in Nepal: Finding the optimal biochar dose through agronomic trials and cost-benefit analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor water and nutrient retention are the major soil fertility limitations in the low productivity agricultural soils of Nepal. The addition of biochar to these soils is one way these hindrances can be overcome. In the present study, six different biochar doses (control, 5 t ha(-1), 10 t ha(-1), 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1)) were applied to amoderately acidic silty loam soil from Rasuwa, Nepal and the effects on soil physicochemical properties and maize and mustard yield over three years (i.e., six cropping seasons), were investigated. Biochar addition did not show significant effects on maize and mustard grain yield in the first year, however significant positive effects (p < 0.01) were observed during the second and third years. During the second year, maize grain yield significantly increased by 50%, 47% and 93% and mustard grain yield by 96%, 128% and 134% at 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha-1 of biochar respectively. A similar significant increase in yield of both crops was observed in the third year. Yields for both maize and mustard correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with plant available P, K+, pH, total OC%, CEC, base saturation, and increased as a function of biochar addition.On the basis of the measured crop yields for the various biochar doses, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out, and gross margin was calculated to optimize biochar dose for local farming practice. Total costs included financial cost (farm input, labor and biochar production cost), health cost and methane emission cost during biochar production. Health costs were a minor factor (< 2% of total biochar preparation cost), whereas methane emission costs were significant (up to 30% of biochar cost, depending on the C price). Total income comprised sale of crops and carbon sequestration credits. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the optimal biochar application dose was 15 t ha(-1) for all C price scenarios, increasing gross margin by 21% and 53%, respectively, for 0 and 42 US$ per ton CO2 price scenarios. In the current situation, only the 0 US$ price scenario is realistic for rural farmers in Nepal, but this still gives benefits of biochar amendment, which are capped at a 15 t ha(-1) biochar addition.

TI  - From Four-Way Linking to a One Health Platform in Egypt: institutionalisation of a multidisciplinary and multisectoral One Health system
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The convergence of humans, animals and our shared environment results in a dynamic in which the health of each group is inextricably linked. Taking into account the fact that the majority of emerging pathogens (e.g. highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) are zoonotic diseases, Egypt has established a national One Health coordination mechanism. The primary purpose of this mechanism is to provide a comprehensive, strategic approach to concurrent and future health challenges that are facing public and animal heath, including environmental impacts. In this way, the public health, animal health and environment sectors can improve disease mitigation measures, develop stronger and more stable public and animal health services, promote effective national communication strategies and improve One Health collaboration among all relevant sectors.In Egypt, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently assist in hosting the country's Four-Way Linking Task Force with the participation of the convening Ministries (Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation [MOALR] through the General Organisation for Veterinary Services and the MOALR's laboratories). In the context of the Emerging Pandemic Threats 2 Program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), FAO plans to assist Egypt in establishing a robust, multidisciplinary and multisectoral One Health system. This system is based on the solid foundation of the Four-Way Linking Platform, which combines information from four functional streams epidemiology, laboratories, and animal and human health. Egypt's platform will involve all sectors concerned with HPAI control and combine all stakeholders in an integrated, holistic approach to improve the detection of, response to and control of any threats at the human animal environment interface in Egypt.
