AB  - The Upper Paraguay Basin (UPRB) covers 361 338 km2 in Brazil and can be divided into the Planalto (plateau) and the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world. This area faces pressures from climate change, land use and cover change (LULC), and infrastructure. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of current environmental policies on native vegetation conservation, water availability, and fire dynamics in the UPRB under current legislation in the state of Mato Grosso (MT). We used LULC data from 1985-2022 to estimate changes in water, native vegetation, exotic grasslands, and areas that could be converted to exotic grasslands for cattle ranching under state Decree N°.774/2024. We analyzed water coverage trends, including riparian preservation areas (RPAs) protected by federal law N°.12651/2012. Evapotranspiration comparisons were made between regions with and without artificial drainage. We also investigated trends in burned areas and the effectiveness of fire ban decrees. Our results indicate a significant increase in exotic grasslands across the entire UPRB portion of MT. We also found a significant decrease in water cover in the Pantanal, accompanied by an increase in native grass cover. Exotic grasslands can cover an area similar to native vegetation due to the new decree (774/2024), which includes 21 000 km2 of legal reserves (sustainable use areas) now available for grazing. The Pantanal has lost more than 8000 km2 of water over the past 37 yrs, with similar decreasing trend in water cover found within RPAs. Areas with artificial drainage showed lower evapotranspiration. Fire ban decrees were ineffective in reducing burned areas to expected levels. Current policies are insufficient to protect the interconnected ecosystems across the UPRB. Immediate measures, including adaptive management, strengthened legislation, and sustainable land and fire management practices, are essential to mitigate environmental impacts in the UPRB and safeguard its ecological and economic integrity. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on species distribution patterns is fundamental to biogeography and evolutionary ecology, especiallyfor socio-economically important agroforestry species such as Parkia biglobosa R.Br. ex Benth and Vitellaria paradoxa CF Gaertn. However, gaps remain regarding the evolution of ecological niches of these widespread species. This study examines the effects of climate change on P. biglobosa and V. paradoxa, two key species of agroforestry parklands in Benin. By integrating intraspecific variation into niche modeling, three homogeneous subgroups (North, Center, and South) were identified and analyzed under current and future climate conditions. Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt), was used, chosen for its predictive power and flexibility in correcting for data bias. Climate projections were based on common socio-economic scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), representing a moderate mitigation scenario and a high emissions scenario, respectively. The results showed significant climate change effects across subgroups for both species, mediated by temperature and humidity. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the northern subgroup of P. biglobosa exhibited habitat shifts towards the central and southern subgroup regions, while the central and southern subgroups showed predictive habitat loss. For V. paradoxa, this scenario predicted significant habitat loss for the northern and central subgroups, while the southern subgroup demonstrated habitat expansion along altitudinal gradients. The more severe SSP-5–8.5 scenario predicted extensive habitat loss for both species. The Sudano-Guinean and Guineo-Congo zones remain climatically suitable for both species under future projections. The most pronounced interspecific niche overlap occurred between the northern and southern subgroups, indicating considerable ecological similarity. These results highlight the need for climate-adaptive management strategies in agroforestry systems with particular emphasis on subgroups facing imminent habitat loss. Future research directions should explore adaptive management approaches while maintaining essential ecosystem services and supporting local livelihoods. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Two major perenial disasters are prevalent in Indonesia, namely, peatland fires and volcanic activities associated with Andesite rock. Thus, the Indonesian Government has prioritized the prevention and mitigation of both disasters. Indonesia's Research Center for Satellite Technology-National Research and Innovation Agency then implemented the program as a satellite payload project. In this study, we describe the design of a space-based mid-wavelength infrared (SMWIR) camera module to monitor peatland fires and volcanic activities associated with Andesite rock. Using the spectral range as the basis of design and the iteration process of general steps in designing a camera, a SMWIR camera module was successfully designed. First, the spectral range was obtained by an intersection of four methods of determining spectral bands. Subsequently, the optical section, was conducted using Zemax by applying three criteria to analyze the optical performance, such as the spot diagram, encircled energy, and modulation transfer function (MTF). Thereafter, the mechanical design was achieved through the SOLIDWORKS software. The fourth step, namely, the structure or thermal design, was achieved by both Thermal Desktop/SINDA FLUINT and Zemax. In the electronic section, both the camera and detector were developed. Finally, a calibration system was specified over the module. Results in the form of graphs, pictures, and tables indicate that all established conditions, including those of the technical side, were achieved. Therefore, high performance in terms of the image, durability, transmission, and thermal stability can easily be achieved; additionally, the module is feasible, lightweight, and compact. © 2024 National Authority of Remote Sensing and Space Science

AB  - Landslides in Sukajaya, Bogor, have caused damage to secondary forests, agriculture, plantations, and also to settlements. Sustainable strategies, including vegetation-based restoration technology, can mitigate landslides, preserve ecosystems, and enhance farmers’ livelihoods. This study presents a post-landslide sustainability analysis of agroforestry using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique. Monte Carlo analysis and the alternating least-squares algorithm were used to assess sustainability status and identify key characteristics of innovative mitigation strategies. The sustainability index for agroforestry in Sukajaya, spanning economic, environmental, social, technological, and institutional dimensions, ranged from 52.53% to 62.51%, indicating that it is overall fairly sustainable. Rap-Pforest leverage analysis identified 12 attributes out of 42 with an influential impact on the sustainability index. Monte Carlo analyses confirmed a stable sustainability status, as variations were insignificant within the 95% confidence interval. Strategies to enhance the sustainability of agroforestry for landslide mitigation in Sukajaya should focus on adopting advanced agricultural technologies, such as precision farming and agroecological approaches. Additionally, efforts should be directed toward empowering farmer groups, implementing soil conservation measures, enhancing government involvement, and improving market accessibility. Therefore, the sustainability of agroforestry should prioritize technological aspects, with a focus on key technological attributes to inform government policies and programs for landslide mitigation. ©2025 The authors.

AB  - The large diversity of ecosystem services provided by natural wetlands has been underestimated by decision-making authorities in Brazil, posing a threat to sustainable development. The intensive land use practices and increased water usage in the country are the main forces driving the degradation and depletion of small wetlands. The aim of this study was to assess the spatiotemporal changes in geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) in the Paulista Peripheral Depression in São Paulo State, considering the intensification of land use and land cover (LULC) and the role of local governance in protecting water resources in these environments. Remote sensing imagery and climate data were utilized to analyze the spatial‒temporal changes in GIWs. The effectiveness of local governance policies in addressing wetland protection concerns was also evaluated. The findings indicate that the intensification of LULC has negative impacts on GIWs, leading to their depletion or degradation. Additionally, GIWs are outside the scope of regulatory protection at the federal, state, and local levels. This lack of protection contributes to the vulnerability of wetland resources, poses risks to local ecological benefits, and exacerbates social-environmental issues such as water scarcity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Fires are increasingly affecting tropical biomes, where landscape-fire interactions remain understudied. We investigate the fire-proneness—the likelihood of a land use or land cover (LULC) type burning more or less than expected based on availability—in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). This biodiversity hotspot is increasingly affected by fires due to human activities and climate change. Using a selection ratio-based approach, we analyzed fire-LULC interactions in 40,869 fires over a 35-year period (1987–2022) across various ecoregions in the AF. Our findings revealed that secondary forests, forest areas that have regrown after major disturbances, burned 61% more than expected by chance, whereas old-growth forests, native forests that have developed over very long periods, burned 57% less than expected, highlighting a nearly inverse relationship in their fire-proneness. Interestingly, our data indicate that pastures in the AF are less prone to fire than expected, despite being considered among the land uses that burn the most in Brazil. Other LULCs showed variable fire-proneness, with some differences between ecoregions. Over time, the fire-proneness of secondary forests decreased, likely due to forest aging and changes in land management practices. We emphasize the necessity for tailored fire management strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities of secondary forests, particularly in the context of ongoing restoration efforts aimed at increasing native forests. Effective measures, including the implementation of 'fire-smart management' practices and enhancing the perceived value of secondary forests among local communities, are crucial for mitigating fire risks. Integrating these strategies with incentive-based approaches can bolster fire prevention, ensuring the long-term success of restoration programs. Our study provides a framework for understanding fire-landscape dynamics in tropical forests and offers actionable insights for practitioners working to safeguard these biomes from the escalating threat of wildfires. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Mangrove forest destruction in Langsa City is caused by land conversion into ponds and illegal logging for charcoal production. Knowledge of global warming mitigation through mangrove conservation and rehabilitation is important for the community to have a positive and environmentally friendly attitude. The study aims to: (1) evaluate community knowledge about global warming mitigation through mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, (2) analyze the relationship between the attitudes and behavior of people living near mangrove forests, and (3) examine the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of people living near mangrove forests. The study was conducted in Cinta Raja and Kuala Langsa Villages using a quantitative correlational design approach. The research population was the entire local community; samples were taken by purposive sampling based on data collection activities through structured interviews, observations, and documentation. The results of the study showed that the variable of community attitudes towards mangrove forests was in the good category (77 %), while mitigation knowledge (69 %) and conservative behavior (67 %) were in the moderate category. Positive attitudes were strongly correlated with conservative behavior and had a significant effect, while knowledge played a role in shaping attitudes but did not directly influence behavior. Therefore, increasing knowledge is a strategic step to strengthen mangrove conservation efforts. Contribution: Increasing knowledge of global warming mitigation can strengthen positive attitudes and encourage conservative behavior among people in mangrove forests. It is recommended to increase education, socialization, support from local organizations, and mangrove conservation and rehabilitation practices to support global warming mitigation. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Extreme wildfires present an ever-increasing problem in different landscapes around the world. Here, we explore recent wildfires to prioritize recovery efforts and mitigate effects of future wildfires in the Pantanal, the largest continuous wetland in the world. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM), we categorize affected areas based on potential levels of degradation by fire and the predicted suitability for threatened and fire-sensitive plants. Based on this information, we identify key areas for fire prevention. Under land cover change scenarios predicted for 2050, approximately 25 % of the land cover under future threat will have potentially high biomass accumulation. We identified 1272 km2 in priority areas with forest formation, with restoration cost of at least US$ 576,189. This case study provides an analysis workflow that can be used to assess other wildfire-threatened parts of the world. These results can inform public policy to establish new fire brigades, conservation efforts using Integrated Fire Management, and restoration areas to mitigate biodiversity loss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatland fires generate substantial quantities of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and in Indonesia are intensified during El Niño-related drought leading to severe air quality impacts affecting local and distant populations. Limited in-situ data often necessitates reliance on air quality models, like that of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, whose accuracy in extreme conditions is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate how a network of low-cost sensors around Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan during the 2019 fire season, quantified extreme air quality and city-scale variability. The data indicates relatively strong model performance. Health impacts are substantial with estimates of over 1200 excess deaths in the Palangka Raya region, over 3200 across Central Kalimantan and more than 87,000 nationwide in 2019 due to fire-induced PM2.5 exposure. These findings highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate extreme fire events, including reducing fire use and landscape remediation to prevent peat fire ignition. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Forest fires pose a significant challenge in Riau Province, Indonesia, especially in peatland areas. This study employs the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to analyze the confidence levels of hotspots, aiming to predict potential fire occurrences and improve fire management strategies. The research focuses on peatlands spanning 3.86 million ha, using key variables such as NDVI, surface temperature, and peat thickness derived from satellite data. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.732 and a classification accuracy of 70.3%, with medium-confidence hotspots demonstrating the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.707, F1-score: 0.804). However, the model struggled with low-confidence hotspots, reflecting challenges in distinguishing less prominent patterns in the data. Compared to other methods, RF demonstrates strong potential in handling complex environmental datasets, making it a valuable tool for hotspot prediction. This study contributes to understanding forest fire risks in peatlands and provides actionable insights for improving preparedness and mitigation efforts. © 2025 Unik et al.

AB  - Shoreline change is a dynamic and complex phenomenon influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring these changes is crucial for understanding coastal dynamics, managing resources, and mitigating the impacts of coastal erosion and accretion. Remote sensing plays a vital role in monitoring shoreline change. This technology has emerged as a powerful tool for accessing and monitoring shoreline changes due to its ability to capture large-scale spatial data over different periods. This study investigated the dynamic changes in shoreline position in Bali Province from 2016 to 2021 using high-resolution PlanetScope imagery data. Multitemporal shorelines were extracted using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to delineate seawater from distinct land-cover types. The end point rate (EPR) model was then used to statistically quantify the shoreline change rates. The results revealed variations in the positions of the shorelines throughout the study, with rapid erosion emerging as a major concern in Bali Province, primarily driven by human activities and/or coastal hydrodynamics. During the study period, the shoreline in Bali Province decreased from 668.64 km to 662.59 km at an average rate of -1.21 m/yr due to continuous erosion, with the most significant retreat occurring at Klungkung Regency. On the other hand, human-caused shoreline advancement, such as land reclamation, harbor, and airport construction, has resulted in a net land increase of 1.25 km2. The protection strategies include structural interventions such as breakwaters and seawalls. The finding provides valuable information that will be helpful for coastal planning and management to reduce the loss of the economy and safeguard the future coastal environment in Bali's coastal areas. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Faltacaria moluccana at its early plantation, is devastated by heat and water stress due to current global climate change. Production forests in Indonesia suggested to use biochar to enhance the durability of early growth F. moluccana in the field. Empty fruit bunches (EFB), a gigantic abundant waste material in Indonesia, pose its potential as biochar feedstock. This study aims to evaluate the effects of EFB biochar on the growth of F. moluccana for one year in a field setting. The experiment used two biochar application rates (25 and 50 tons/ha) and biochar produced at two pyrolysis temperatures (400°C and 600°C). Climatic factors (rainfall and average temperature) were monitored to assess how biochar interacted with field conditions to influence the growth of F. moluccana. EFB biochar increased height and diameter increment by up to 25% and 42%, respectively, compared to control after one year. While pyrolysis temperatures show no impact on growth, biochar application rates of 25 and 50 tons/ha significantly boost diameter increments by 36% and 42%, respectively, compared to controls, without affecting height. Biochar also improves monthly growth increments under water and heat stress. EFB biochar optimizes growth under current climate conditions in Indonesia and mitigates the negative effects of extreme temperature fluctuations. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of biodiversity loss, particularly in tropical regions. Cacao agroforestry systems can both support and benefit from high levels of biodiversity via associated pest control services from birds and bats, although their potential to do so likely depends on local management and the landscape context. However, how interactions between local-scale agroforestry practices and landscape-scale habitat features shape bird and bat communities in these systems remains poorly understood. We studied birds and bats in 28 smallholder cacao agroforests in the Peruvian Amazon, comparing two regions with contrasting levels of agricultural intensification. We analyzed how local tree diversity and canopy cover interact with surrounding landscape tree cover and regional agricultural intensity to influence species richness and community composition. Results showed that local tree diversity increased bird richness, but only in the intensively farmed region. Local canopy cover had contrasting effects: it negatively impacted bird richness, abundance, and bat activity in more open landscapes (<55 % tree cover), but positively in forested landscapes (>80 % tree cover). Notably, these interactions were significant when considering the landscape tree cover at small spatial scales (250 m), but not at 500 m or 1000 m. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting cacao agroforestry management to the surrounding landscape. Retaining high local canopy cover supports flying vertebrate diversity and associated ecosystem services in forested landscapes, while restoration of landscape tree cover could enhance bird and bat populations that may contribute to pest suppression services in deforested areas. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Territorial behaviour, while widespread among birds, remains poorly studied in tropical regions. Here, we investigated the territorial behaviour of the Vulnerable ochre-breasted pipit Anthus nattereri in the Upper Rio Grande Grasslands, state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Through a year-round monitoring of both ringed and non-ringed birds (which were individually identified by song features), we found that the species exhibits a seasonal territorial strategy. During the late dry season and the first half of the wet season, coinciding with the species’ breeding period, individuals defend territories primarily through aerial displays. Mean territory size based on the 95% kernel isopleth was 2.04 hectares (ranging from 0.46 to 5.26 hectares), while mean territory size based on the 80% kernel isopleth was 1.18 hectares (0.28–2.77 hectares). Overlap between neighbouring territories were frequent but small and restricted to the territory borders, with agonistic encounters being relatively rare, especially between neighbours (“dear enemy” relationship). Territories were predominantly located on hilltops and/or smooth slopes covered by native grasslands, with few or no shrubs, always on well-drained soils. The species primarily occupied grassland patches ranging from early to intermediate stages of post-fire regeneration. Wildfires only disrupted territories that have been completely burned, with birds that inhabited partially burned areas staying in their territories. Ochre-breasted pipits appear to be well adapted to living in different post-fire regeneration age, and the potential benefits of controlled burning practices for enhancing landscape heterogeneity warrant further investigation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2025.

AB  - This study aims to analyze land cover dynamics and evaluate the sustainability status of marine tourism in the Mandeh region. Despite its significant tourism potential, the region faces ecological and socio-economic challenges. This research integrates land cover change analysis with sustainability assessments to provide a foundation for policy recommendations and strategic development approaches. A descriptive research approach was employed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data were gathered through field observations, while quantitative data were analyzed using remote sensing to assess land cover changes and sustainability status. The study applied purposive sampling for data selection and utilized supervised classification with the Maximum Likelihood method to analyze land cover changes. Additionally, the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) method, specifically the Rapid Appraisal of the Mandeh Region (Rap-MR), was used to evaluate sustainability across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The results indicate significant land cover transformations in the Mandeh region from 2020 to 2030. Water Bodies (WB) remain dominant but exhibit a slight decline due to sedimentation and climate change. Secondary Forest (SF) and Primary Forest (PF) are expected to decrease, mainly due to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development. Mangroves (Ms) and Mixed Gardens (MG) are also projected to shrink, reflecting conservation challenges. Conversely, Built-up Land (BuL) and Palm Plantations (PP) are anticipated to expand, driven by tourism and economic growth. Land cover classification achieved high accuracy, with an overall accuracy rate exceeding 87%. The sustainability analysis highlights economic benefits from tourism but reveals conflicts in resource utilization. The economic dimension shows a need for infrastructure investment and revenue optimization, while the social dimension emphasizes education and disaster preparedness. The environmental dimension calls for stricter conservation policies and land-use planning. In conclusion, the Mandeh region requires a balanced approach to development, integrating economic growth with environmental sustainability. Policy interventions should focus on reforestation, controlled urban expansion, and sustainable tourism management to ensure long-term ecological and socio-economic stability. © 2025, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rice agriculture faces challenges related to incorrect fertilizer use and the inappropriate application of improved varieties. Site-specific nutrient management offers a viable method for modifying fertilizer usage in alignment with the distinct needs of various rice cultivars and the prevailing soil conditions. This study investigated the effects of site-specific nutrient management on the growth and productivity of adaptable-modified rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) in Semarang, Indonesia Additionally, it analyzed the agronomic and economic outcomes of implementing site-specific nutrient management versus traditional fertilization practices. METHODS: The three varieties, Inpari-6 (V1), Hipa-5 (V2), and local (V3) were tested with a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Fertilizer treatments included the Ministry of Agriculture recommendations (P1), site-specific fertilizer using a soil test kit (P2), and farmer’s fertilization practices (P3). The data obtained consisted of growth indicators, yield elements, and economic efficiency. FINDINGS: The results showed that the combination of site-specific fertilization (P2) and Inpari-6 produced the highest number of productive tillers (16) and yielded 7.4 ton per hectares of milled dry grain, increasing productivity by 39.6 percent. The integration of this combination led to the highest decrease in nitrogen fertilizer application and improved profit margins, achieving a profit difference of 42.8 percent relative to the fertilization practices typically used by farmers. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of site-specific nutrient management in optimizing resource use, decreasing nitrogen runoff, and elevating rice yields. CONCLUSION: Site-specific nutrient management outperformed the traditional fertilization methods, especially when combined with the Inpari-6 variety. These findings support using site-specific nutrient management as a long-term strategy to increase yields, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance economic returns. More extensive studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of site-specific nutrient management on both the environment and agronomy in different rice cultivation regions. © 2025 The author(s).

AB  - Conservation of undrained tropical peatland ecosystems is critical for climate change mitigation as they store a tremendous amount of soil carbon that is preserved under anoxic water-logged conditions. Unfortunately, there are too few measurements of carbon fluxes from these ecosystems to estimate the climate change mitigation potential from such conservation efforts. Here, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as fluvial organic carbon export over the peat swamp forest within an undrained tropical peatland landscape in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our measurements throughout one year (Oct 2022–Sep 2023) showed that despite its water-logged condition, peat and water overlying the swamp forest on average emits 11.02 ± 0.49 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 of CO2 and 0.58 ± 0.04 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1 of CH4. Further, the fluvial organic carbon export contributes to additional carbon loss of 1.68 ± 0.06 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Our results help improve the accuracy of carbon accounting from undrained tropical peatlands, where we estimated a total carbon loss of 13.28 ± 0.50 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Nevertheless, the total carbon loss reported from our sites is about half than what is reported from the drained peatland landscapes in the region and resulted in a larger onsite carbon sink potential estimate compared to other undrained peat swamp forests. Together, these findings indicate that conserving the remaining undrained peatland ecosystems in Indonesia from drainage and degradation is a promising natural climate solution strategy that avoids significant carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The global temperature is increasing mainly due to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in the last century. While the overall global increase in emissions is due to fossil fuel operations, Brazil has as its primary emitter from forestry and land use, and agriculture sectors. Though these sectors can emit, both can play an important role in mitigating global warming, due to the natural ecosystem and agroecosystem capability of carbon absorption. We aimed to understand the impact of carbon removal on Brazil's national inventory. For that, we compared two GHG inventories - Climate TRACE and SEEG - and explored how precipitation and photosynthesis impact their estimates to determine how the inventories capture seasonal variability. First, we compared the GHG emissions and removals estimates for each sector between both inventories, especially the Forestry and Land Use sector. Moreover, we performed correlation analysis and linear regressions between them, at a biome and pixel level between 2015 and 2022. Our results show that differences between the GHG inventories could reach 1 Giga ton of CO2 eq in some years, mainly due to the forestry sector. Furthermore, in some ecosystems, such as Caatinga, precipitation, and photosynthesis were increasing between 2015 and 2022, thus boosting the removal capacity in this biome. In 2022, the Caatinga GHG removal represented almost 50 % of the total removals in Brazil. A higher removal capacity could significantly contribute to achieving net-zero GHG emissions, especially if deforestation and other anthropogenic disturbances to ecosystems are halted. Our findings suggest that the Climate TRACE inventory captures more seasonal variability than SEEG. This outcome highlights the open issue of carbon removal estimates and also that seasonal aspects could be incorporated to improve our understanding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Different global agendas have discussed the role of soils in mitigating and reducing global problems related to climate change, food security, biodiversity and erosion, among others. With this in mind, the aim was to draw up an overview of the main soil agendas in Europe and Brazil, analysing their impact on the establishment of legal frameworks for soil use and conservation. In Brazil, pastures are seen as an important alternative for converting degraded areas into ecosystem services. To this end, a literature review was carried out using databases on the Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Scielo platforms, as well as consulting documents from the European Union Missions in Horizon Europe and Brazilian legislation on the subject. In a pilot river basin, the Potential for Conservation Use (PCU) method was applied, which is used in Brazil to assess the impacts of different uses on the natural capital of soils, serving as a metric to guide public soil conservation policies. It was concluded that, on the European scene, discussions on soils have taken place in an integrated and organised way, with actions to mobilise different players in society. In Brazil, even though there are important legal frameworks, actions are still restricted and disjointed, pointing to the need for progress in soil governance. In both scenarios, there is a need for scientifically validated metrics at regional scales that can contribute to a harmonised database capable of subsidising the development of efficient public policies to advance soil conservation at a global level. © 2024

AB  - This study investigates the role of coffee agroforestry in sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions in Kluncing, Ijen, Indonesia. By quantifying bird, butterfly, and coffee insect diversity using the Shannon-Wiener index, it evaluates ecological dynamics and their implications for sustainable land management. Bird communities demonstrated the highest diversity (2.911), indicating ecosystem stability, while butterflies (2.481) and coffee insects (1.841) exhibited lower diversity, reflecting habitat and resource limitations. Trophic network modeling using NetworkX identified keystone species like Collocalia linchi (21.9% relative abundance) among birds and the Formicidae family (29.8% relative abundance) among coffee insects, emphasizing their critical roles in ecosystem balance. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) highlighted the influence of environmental factors on species distribution. Species such as Ariadne ariadne and Delias belisama were sensitive to humidity and temperature, while Collocalia linchi favored areas with higher light intensity. The findings underscore the importance of tailored management practices to address species-specific responses to microclimatic variations. Sustainable agroforestry management is vital for preserving biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem stability, and ensuring agricultural productivity. This study also highlights challenges posed by habitat degradation and climate change, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies to safeguard this unique agroforestry landscape. © 2025@ author(s).

AB  - Aquatic heavy metal pollution, driven by industrialization and climate change, threatens marine ecosystems through bioaccumulation. Climate-induced salinity fluctuations influence metal speciation and bioavailability in coastal environments. Seaweeds, crucial for nutrient cycling and economic use, exhibit species-specific metal uptake under varying salinity conditions. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine research trends from 1995 to 2024 on the impact of salinity on metal accumulation in seaweeds. A search conducted on 8 October 2024 resulted in 242 articles, which were then filtered to 28 relevant studies for analysis. Using the Web of Science Core Collection, these articles were analyzed with VOSviewer and Bibliometrix to identify key contributors, collaborations, and research themes. Results reveal a growing academic interest since 2006, with increasing citation counts reflecting global concern over salinity and heavy metal pollution. Significant contributions from Brazil and Portugal, alongside strong European collaborations, highlight regional strengths. Five key themes emerge, encompassing seaweed physiology, biomonitoring, and phytoremediation. Findings indicate that salinity fluctuations significantly affect metal bioavailability and uptake in seaweeds, influenced by species-specific factors, temperature, and pH. This study highlights the need for targeted, site-specific research on diverse seaweed species to effectively manage heavy metal pollution in coastal ecosystems, particularly in light of climate change and industrial activities. Additionally, the research emphasizes the potential of seaweeds as bioindicators and bioremediators in environmental monitoring and pollution management. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global warming is a critical factor driving climate change, impacting every aspect of life on Earth. The escalating concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the primary contributor to global warming, necessitates immediate action through effective climate mitigation strategies. This study aimed to quantify the biomass and blue carbon stocks in the eastern coastal mangrove forests of North Sumatra and Aceh Provinces in Indonesia, focusing on key sites in Langkat, Deli Serdang, Batu Bara, Tanjung Balai, and Aceh Tamiang Regencies. We measured carbon stock in three carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), necromass, and soil. By analyzing tree stands using parameters such as tree height and diameter at breast height within circular plots (7 m in radius, 125 m apart), we gathered fundamental data on forest structure, species composition, and above- and below-ground biomass. Additionally, we collected soil samples at various points and depths, measuring the amount of wood, stems, or branches (necromass) that fell to or died on the forest floor. Data were collected in plots along a line transect, comprising three transects and six circular plots each. Sixteen diverse mangrove species were found, demonstrating rich mangrove biodiversity. The mangrove forests in the five regencies exhibited significant carbon storage potential, with estimated average above-ground carbon ranging from 96 to 356 MgC/ha and average below-ground carbon from 28 to 153 MgC/ha. The estimated average deadwood carbon varied between 50 and 91 MgC/ha, while soil carbon ranged from 1200 to 2500 MgC/ha. These findings underscore the significant carbon storage potential of these mangrove forests, highlighting their importance to global carbon cycling and climate change mitigation. This research contributes to a broader understanding of mangroves as vital blue carbon ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of conservation efforts such as forest restoration and rehabilitation to enhance their role in stabilizing coastal areas and improving global climate resilience. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - African tropical forests play a crucial role in global carbon dynamics, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation, yet monitoring their structure, diversity, carbon stocks and changes remains challenging. Remote sensing techniques, including multi-spectral data, lidar-based canopy height and vertical structure detection, and radar interferometry, have significantly improved our ability to map forest composition, estimate height and biomass, and detect degradation and deforestation features at a finer scale. Machine learning approaches further enhance these capabilities by integrating multiple data sources to produce improved maps of forest attributes and track changes over time. Despite these advancements, uncertainties remain due to limited ground-truth validation, and the structural complexity and large spatial heterogeneity of African forests. Future developments in remote sensing should examine how multi-sensor integration of high-resolution data from instruments such as Planet, Tandem-X, SPOT and improved AI methods can refine forest composition, carbon storage and function maps, enhance large-scale monitoring of tree height and biomass dynamics, and improve forest degradation and deforestation detection down to tree level. These advancements will be essential for supporting science-based decision-making in forest conservation and climate mitigation.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of tropical habitats, especially extreme megadiverse environments like the campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland), impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to millions of people. The campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the Cerrado biome, a center of endemism in Brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity, where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions. However, this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion, while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace. Thus, understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity. In this work, for the first time, we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic: rocky outcrop, stony grassland, sandy grassland, and peat bog. A total of 12,000 m2 of shrub layer (120 plots of 10 × 10 m) and 120 m2 (120 plots of 1 × 1 m) of herbaceous layer were sampled. We recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families, and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats. Furthermore, we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multiregional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project. This study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types. © 2024

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the existing conditions and prediction of future carbon stocks in the planting of mangroves of the REMAJA PHE ONWJ program in Mekarpohaci Village, Karawang Regency, Indonesia. The observation began with the planting of 1200 seedlings of R. mucronata and A. marina, respectively. Furthermore, the monitoring of life graduation and diameter growth in the 2021-2023 period was carried out. Existing carbon stocks were analyzed by an allometric equation approach and carbon fraction values. Meanwhile, the prediction of future carbon stocks was modeled using Stella v.9.0.2 software concerning the growth rate of seedling stand diameter. The results of the study showed that carbon stocks reached 0.275 tons C in 2021, 3.66 tons C in 2022, and 5,765 tons C in 2023. Meanwhile, future carbon stock predictions indicate that the largest carbon stock in the 10-year growth projection is found in R. mucronata, with a value of 107.79kg C/tree, which includes 5.80kg AGC and 31.99kg BGC. In contrast, A. marina has the lowest carbon stock at 75.54kg C/tree (52.54kg AGC and 22.99kg BGC). The total contribution of carbon sequestration by 2033 is projected to reach 807.36 tons of CO2e, comprised of 474.69 tons of CO2e from R. mucronata and 332.67 tons of CO2e from A. marina.The carbon sequestration indicates that mangrove planting in the REMAJA PHE ONWJ program contributes to the reduction of CO2 gas concentrations in the atmosphere and climate change mitigation and can realize the principles of sustainable development (SDGs). © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

AB  - The Pantanal wetland ecosystem of Brazil is experiencing unprecedented local challenges from anthropogenic pressures, as well as from global climate change. These pressures escalate the zoonotic risks from wildlife populations, whose own susceptibility to disease is enhanced by stressors including habitat loss and fragmentation with the resulting decrement in food availability, immunity and resilience in the face of compounding disease risks. This continuous degradation and fragmentation of the ecosystem increases interactions between animals and humans (including indigenous peoples and local communities) further increasing disease risks for the human populations. Weak health systems across the Pantanal are reflected in limited pathogen surveillance, and poor sanitation and disease control measures, serving to further amplify the region’s epidemic and pandemic potential. Using a transdisciplinary One Health (OH) approach to understand the ecological, social and biological drivers of infectious diseases, our research network developed a framework to conceptualise the current tools, evidence and processes for effective research and knowledge production in the Pantanal Wetland ecosystem. Drawing on the expertise of researchers and non-academic key-stakeholders can inform the work of global OH research networks and strengthen the evidence base for OH policy and practice in the Pantanal and other tropical wetland systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Anthropized areas in the Brazilian Amazon require detailed mapping to identify zones for sustainable use. This study developed a topoclimatic zoning framework to evaluate the conservation and agroforestry potential of three native species: Carapa guianensis (Andiroba), Dipteryx odorata (Cumaru), and Bertholletia excelsa (Amazon Nut). The hypothesis was that integrating topographic and climatic data can effectively identify high-potential areas for these species to support forest restoration and sustainable management. This study applied ecological modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to classify zones into high, medium, and low potential for each species. Results showed Carapa guianensis has high potential in 64% of anthropized areas, Dipteryx odorata in 72% of the Legal Amazon, and Bertholletia excelsa in 58%, highlighting their adaptability and strategic value for restoration efforts. The findings emphasize the importance of topoclimatic zoning as a tool for conservation and sustainable use strategies. By aligning with Brazil’s Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Law, this approach can foster agroforestry practices, enhance biodiversity conservation, and strengthen the Amazon bioeconomy, ensuring ecological resilience and sustainable development. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid economic growth in Southeast Asia has heightened concerns about its environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to CO2 emissions. Despite the growing focus on climate change mitigation, the region faces significant challenges in balancing economic development, energy transitions, and environmental conservation. Existing studies often overlook the complex interplay between these factors, leaving a critical gap in understanding how tailored strategies can address country-specific dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study introduces the “Sustainable Energy-Environment Nexus” (SEEN) framework, which integrates economic growth, energy transitions, and environmental conservation as interconnected elements necessary for achieving carbon neutrality in both the short and long run. Using data from eight Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan) over the period 1990–2023, this study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach and the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) technique to analyze the relationships between CO2 emissions, GDP, financial development, forest areas, renewable energy, non-renewable energy consumption, and trade openness. The findings reveal that GDP and non-renewable energy consumption significantly drive CO2 emissions in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Conversely, forest areas, financial development, renewable energy, and trade openness are effective in reducing emissions in countries such as Vietnam and China. This study highlights the critical role of renewable energy adoption while addressing challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and limited technology transfer. It also identifies opportunities for regional cooperation in innovation and policy harmonization. To support sustainable energy development, tailored policy recommendations include incentivizing investments in renewable energy, enhancing technology transfer, expanding forest conservation efforts, and aligning regional renewable energy targets across ASEAN. The SEEN framework provides a robust foundation for advancing research and policy design aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and promoting environmental sustainability across Southeast Asia. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Determine the soil quality and the emissions of mineralizable soil carbon (C-CO2) in conventional and integrated systems in the Midwest region of Brazil. Methods: The evaluated systems include original pasture (OP), reformed pasture (RP), conventional tillage (CT), direct seeding (DS), and cultivated eucalyptus forest (CF), as well as crop-livestock integration (CLI) and crop-livestock-forest integration (CLFI) systems in both the pasture phase (p) and crop phase (c). The soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon and carbon stock (StoC) of the particulate organic matter (C-POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (C-OMM) fractions, indexes of soil quality, and daily CO2 emission and accumulation in the 0–0.05, 0.05–0.10, 0.10–0.20, and 0.20–0.40 m layers were determined. Results: The CLIp and CLIc systems had the highest SOC contents, reaching 15.47 and 15.04 g kg−1 of C in the 0–0.05 m layer, respectively. For C-POM, the integrated systems in the pasture phase had the highest contents and stocks, storing up to 19 t ha−1 at 0.4 m. For C-OMM, CLIc had the highest contents and stocks, storing up to 57 t ha−1 of C up to 0.4 m. The systems with pasture had the best carbon management indexes. The LI, L, C-POM stock, and CMI remained the most representative variables related to the CLFIp system. Conclusions: integrated systems improve soil quality and store Carbon, especially in recalcitrant fractions of the SOM, with reduced C-CO2 emissions, helping to mitigate climate change in the Central-West region of Brazil. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2025.

AB  - Fire occurrence in tropical peatlands is closely related to both land cover (LC) type and proximity to drainage (canal) networks. However, little is known about the extent to which LC and drainage density interact to alter fire occurrence. Here, we assess the relationship between these variables in the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia, spanning a five-year period of inter-annual climatic variability. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite imagery was used to map active fire hotspots. Drained peatlands experienced up to 13 times greater annual mean hotspot density (number of fire hotspots per km2) when compared to peatlands without canals. The greatest difference in fire hotspot density between drained and undrained peatlands occurred in forested peatlands (by a factor of 2.6-13.3), followed by shrublands (1.1-7.6), crop lands (1.4-5.0) and plantations (1.2-2.6), where largest differences were found in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral years. We found a curvilinear relationship between hotspot density and canal density, with the relationship depending on LC and ENSO status. At low to moderate drainage density, hotspot density increased with drainage density in all LC types in 2013-2017. Heavily drained plantations experienced a lower hotspot density than moderately drained plantations possibly due to factors such as management practices or impacts of previous fire history. The relationship with drainage density was strongest in 2013, an ENSO-neutral year, and weakest in the strong El Niño of 2015. Our findings support the critical need for fire management in drained tropical peat areas. Peat fire management planning and peatland restoration should be tailored to the differing responses of fire to climate variability, drainage density and LC types. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change is expected to severely impact the forestry industry by increasing wildfire occurrence, triggering pest outbreaks, or modifying trees' productivity. To understand the long-term impact of climate change on forest production, we investigated how fluctuations in forest productivity and land availability would impact the expansion of Brazil's pulp and paper industry. We used a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Model to evaluate the financial returns, costs, and potential mill locations under multiple climates and land market scenarios. The study area was the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, which is among the world's most attractive natural resources investments in pulp and paper. Our results showed that the region needs to expand its plantation forest area by at least 586,166 ha from the current land base of 912,371 ha in the upcoming decades to supply enough pulpwood for incoming mills and offset potential productivity losses driven by climate change. Pulpwood production cost is expected to increase by 0.61 % annually (or 16.4 % in the next 25 years). These results highlight the risks associated with losses in the productivity of plantation forests due to the changes in climate and land use. We assessed the importance of land use change rate in the market development. If it remains unchanged, the industry's success could be restrained, reducing positive externalities in the region. Furthermore, the model we proposed here can be extended to other industrial problems (e.g., wood pellet mills and biochar collection points) and assess different climate scenarios (e.g., climate shocks like droughts or wildfires). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon stock is an essential indicator in assessing ecosystem services that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, thereby helping to reduce the negative impacts of global climate change. Vegetation in agroforestry systems is vital in carbon storage and climate change mitigation. As a tropical country, Indonesia is vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. Wonosobo, the research location, is a district in Central Java Province, Indonesia. This study aims to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon stock of agroforestry areas in Mergolangu and Karangsambung Villages, Wonosobo, Central Java, Indonesia. The method used is simple random sampling at three research stations, i.e.: Mixed agroforestry (Station I), Agathis-based agroforestry (Station II), and Pine-based agroforestry (Station III). Of the three stations, the most extensive carbon stock was produced by Mixed agroforestry with an Aboveground Biomass (AGB) of 2,169.24 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 1,019.54 MgC/ha, followed by Agathis-based agroforestry with an AGB of 443.20 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 208.30 MgC/ha and Pine-based agroforestry with AGB amount of 359.10 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 158.14 MgC/ha. © 2024, Smujo International.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) incorporating non-native tree species such as Eucalyptus are increasingly being adopted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall δ13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 μm, 250-53 μm, and <53 μm) and analyzed for δ13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha-1), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha-1). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the “native” SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flooding is a frequent disaster in Indonesia, especially in the Upper Citarum River Basin, causing substantial damage. This study assesses the impact of afforestation on runoff, peak discharge and flood risks under different storm conditions using hydrological (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models. Six afforestation scenarios were analyzed: No Forest (NF), Medium Afforestation (MF), Bandung's 2029 spatial plan (F-2029), Riverbank Afforestation (RF), spatial plan for 2029 (SP-2029) and No Built-up (NB), with Land Cover 2021 (LC-2021) as the baseline. Rainfall return periods (2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 years) were generated from 32 years of rainfall data. The results show land cover changes significantly influence runoff, with urbanization increasing flood risks and afforestation improving water retention. Riverbank afforestation (RF) and reduced built-up areas (NB) were the most effective in mitigating flood risks, while reduced forest cover (NF) and urban expansion (SP-2029) exacerbated flooding. Validation with historical flood data highlighted flood-prone areas like Margahayu, Bojongsoang, Dayeuhkolot and Baleendah. Frequent but less severe floods were noted in 2- and 5-year return period scenarios. These findings emphasize the critical role of afforestation and land cover management in reducing flood risks and enhancing resilience in the Upper Citarum Basin. © 2025 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

AB  - The 2023 progress report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is weak, even regressing, including key targets related to climate change, and at risk of failure. Estuarine ecosystems dominated by mangrove vegetation are critical for climate change mitigation. However, these ecosystems continue to be degraded at multiple levels. Indonesia, with the largest mangrove forest area in the world, requires conservation and restoration efforts to effectively mitigate climate change impacts. This study aims to analyze the role of estuarine ecosystems in storing carbon for climate change mitigation. This research uses bibliometric analysis method to produce an in-depth and comprehensive analysis. The data source is the Scopus database, visualized using the VOSviewer application. After limitation, 219 out of 1485 documents that fit the inclusion criteria were obtained. The results showed a significant increase in interest in the topic of the role of estuarine ecosystems for climate change mitigation in the last two years. This research underscores the importance of mangroves restoration in estuarine ecosystems, as their condition has significant impacts on climate change and coastal communities. Nature-based solutions such as the use of green energy, implementation of new technologies such as remote monitoring, and ecosystem balance-based policy-making are recommended. The integration of multi-disciplinary and multi-technology approaches is crucial to build resilient, natural estuarine ecosystems and restore ecosystem services. These findings can also provide a scientific basis for the management of estuarine ecosystems to support SDG 13 Climate Action. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Pará, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH ≥10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH ≥10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha-1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The growing demand for adopting more sustainable agricultural management practices worldwide has prompted soil health assessment studies. In southern Brazil, there is a growing diversification in soil use and management systems. This study aimed to evaluate soil health under different soil use and management systems in this region using the Soil Management Assessment Framework. The study investigated secondary forest, no-tillage, and pasture across three mesoregions of Paraná State: West, Southwest, and Central East. Soil health was evaluated in the surface layer, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of soil use and management on soil health. Scores for bulk density, water-filled pore space, pH, phosphorus, potassium, microbial biomass carbon, and β-glucosidase activity were sensitive to detecting changes in soil conditions. However, other indicators, such as macroaggregate stability and total organic carbon, need refined algorithms for regional adaptation. Differences in soil health among soil use and management were observed. Secondary forest generally maintained optimal soil health indices, with values above 0.86. No-tillage showed good soil health indices in the evaluated layer, with values above 0.80. Notably, no-tillage with organic agricultural systems and the application of organic residues appeared to contribute positively to soil health improvement, with indices reaching 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. Pastures, especially silvopasture, showed potential for improving soil health through plant diversity, achieving an index of 0.88. We suggest that future studies compare different soil health indices to improve algorithms for interpreting soil health indicators on a regional scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ‘BRS Vitória’ is the leading seedless table grape cultivar in tropical regions of Brazil, but there is a lack of information regarding suitable rootstocks for subtropical cultivation. This study aimed to evaluate the productive performance and nutrient cycling of ‘BRS Vitória’ grapevines grafted onto rootstocks ‘IAC 572’, ‘IAC 766’, and ‘1103P’ under subtropical climate conditions. Crop yield, nutrient content, and weight of shoots and bunches were assessed over two growing seasons, along with nutrient removal via pruning and harvest and nutrient utilization efficiency. The ‘IAC 572’ rootstock promoted greater shoot biomass accumulation and crop yield compared to ‘IAC 766’ and ‘1103P’. Both nutrient content and nutrient accumulation were also higher in grapevines grafted onto the ‘IAC 572’ rootstock. Nevertheless, the amount of nutrients transported to the bunch was comparatively lower than in ‘IAC 766’ and ‘1103P’. Given its superior productivity, nutrient accumulation capacity, and nutrient utilization efficiency, the ‘IAC 572’ rootstock is more suitable for ‘BRS Vitória’ grapevines in subtropical regions. © 2025, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

AB  - Many cities in Indonesia are facing problems caused by climate change, which affect their population, society, and infrastructure. These problems range from increased exposure to coastal flooding to discomfort caused by urban heat, depending on geographical conditions. Research on best practices used by communities to withstand the impacts of climate change through various adaptation and mitigation efforts can be an example of good initiatives and holistic knowledge. This study employs an extractive social research methodology through in-depth interviews and observations in community and informal settlement environments on the coast of Bandar Lampung city, which aims to understand the socio-ecological system and design better and more participatory local adaptation policies can be useful. This journal is written using a narrative approach as the basis for argumentation and reflection. The results conclude that the relationship between informal communities and the natural environment is disrupted by activities such as mangrove destruction and land reclamation; as a result, these communities are feeling the impacts of climate change. But They managed to survive through simple adaptive measures, including purchasing daily water, raising the floors of buildings, gathering with their families, and accepting the assistance and social programs available in their midst. These communities are able to survive in current conditions through a variety of diverse policy choices and interventions in their areas. the adaptation and mitigation they carry out is closely related to the relationship between humans and the economy, namely their livelihood as fishermen, but the relationship between humans and ecology, they intervene in the environment thereby destroying land, water and ocean ecosystems, which also makes them more vulnerable. © 2025 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - The prevalence of bulbuls in the Indonesian cage bird trade raises concerns about its impact on their distributions and, consequently, the ecological balance. This study delves into the trade dynamics of bulbuls, examining their market prevalence and its correlation with their abundance in the wild and their suitable habitats. We conducted bird market surveys across Java, supplemented by online trade surveys to ascertain market prevalence. Concurrently, we collected bulbul's presence data from three databases and field surveys from 2018 to 2023. We used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the suitable habitats for bulbuls. The findings revealed that 20 bulbul species, comprising 11 native and 9 non-native to Java, were encountered in 20 bird markets, totalling 35,715 individuals. Sooty-headed (Pycnonotus aurigaster) and yellow-vented (P. goiavier) bulbuls, both Least Concern, dominated the field-RAI (Relative Abundance Index) and trade-RAI. Notably, rare species such as the straw-headed bulbul (P. zeylanicus, Critically Endangered) and extirpated from Java, were present in markets. We found no relationship between the field-RAI and the trade-RAI, suggesting that all species were sought after regardless of their abundance. However, we found that threatened species face over-harvesting based on the ratio between trade-RAI and field-RAI. A significant portion of predicted suitable habitats for resident species fell outside bird-friendly areas. Urgent intervention measures, targeting small-scale agroforestry landowners and key sites for population protection, are imperative to mitigate the potential ecological consequences of the bulbul trade and ensure their continued contribution to tropical ecosystem health. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the influence of geological characteristics, land cover, slope levels, and rainfall intensity on landslide susceptibility. The study investigates the impact of the Sumatran Fault's active segments on geological instability and examines how human activities and climatic factors contribute to landslide risks. A quantitative approach integrates geological conditions, slope analysis, land cover classification, and rainfall data, validated through field testing. Data sources include geological maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2024, and historical rainfall records. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm and overlay analysis facilitated the identification of landslide-prone zones. The results reveal that igneous rocks dominate 41 % of the area, followed by sedimentary (33 %) and metamorphic rocks (25 %), with steep slopes (24–45%) covering 39 %. Annual rainfall exceeds 1500 mm, with areas receiving >2500 mm constituting 46 % of the region. These factors, combined with deforestation and unsustainable land practices, heighten landslide risks, particularly in the western fault zone. High-vulnerability areas account for 13 % of the region, concentrated in steep and fault-affected zones, while medium-vulnerability zones dominate at 86 %. The study concludes that Pasaman Regency requires integrated strategies, including slope stabilization, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices, to mitigate landslide risks. Infrastructure resilience, community-based disaster management, and climate adaptation measures are critical for reducing socioeconomic impacts and enhancing environmental sustainability. The findings provide actionable insights for disaster risk reduction and land-use planning, emphasizing the interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors in landslide vulnerability. © 2025, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

AB  - Moringa oleifera Lam. is a species with significant potential for use in restoration programs in degraded areas. The species is used in folk medicine, water purification, as forage, as a condiment, among other ends, and has the ability to create an environment conducive to the establishment of other species. However, low seed germination rates and limited vegetative propagation are important challenges. Temperature stands out among the variables that have a strong impact on the germination of seeds of this species. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of temperature on the germination of M. oleifera seeds in order to determine the ideal thermal range and calculate the net energy (enthalpy) change of activation of germination, in addition to the thermal implications for the establishment of this plant in degraded areas under ecological restoration. To this end, an experiment was conducted using six seed batches collected in an Atlantic Forest environment in Northeastern Brazil from the 2020 and 2021 harvests. The seeds were subjected to constant temperatures of 5 to 40 °C. Analyses were performed to evaluate seed germination parameters. Regression analyses were performed to explore the relationships between variables, the net energy variation to understand the energy availability during germination, and a Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify patterns and reduce data dimensionality. The seeds of M. oleifera germinated between 10 and 40 °C, and the optimal temperature was 26 °C. The highest germination speed index (GSI) values were observed between 30 and 35 °C, with the optimal temperature of 28 °C for this variable, which promoted rapid and uniform germination. The energy change (∆H≠) was 11.29 Kcal/mol at 25 °C, 9.65 Kcal/mol at 30 °C, and 10.78 Kcal/mol at 35 °C. Therefore, optimal temperatures for germination (from 25 to 35 °C) favor rapid and uniform germination, essential for the success use of the species in environmental restoration programs. © 2025 SAAB

AB  - Climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented lev-els nowadays. In this context, assessing restoration projects to recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the success of these initiatives. This study evaluated the effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area, diversity, and composition of regenerating and planted species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Southeast Brazil. The experiment consisted of three treatments: row planting (ROW, 2 × 2 m spacing); nucleation (NUC, 13 individuals/nucleus, 5 × 5 m spacing); and control with passive restoration (PAS). The active restoration techniques had different planting densities at project implementation (NUC: 5,200 seedlings ha-1; ROW: 2,177 seedlings ha-1). A floristic survey was carried out within 8 sampling units (15 × 15 m) per treatment 10 years after implementation of the project, including all planted and regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level > 2.5 cm. The abundance, basal area, and species richness of the planted and regenerated communities were estimated. The active restoration techniques (ROW and NUC) resulted in higher values of basal area, abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration (PAS). A higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in ROW than in NUC. Additionally, the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward higher diversity indices in ROW. Regarding the successional trajectory, greater variation in species composition was observed in ROW after 10 years of planting. The species composition was similar in ROW and NUC and differed from the composition in PAS. The species identified as indicator species in each treatment were Annona glabra L. in ROW, Trema micranthum (L.) Blume in NUC, and Vernonanthura polyanthes (Sprengel) Vega & Dematteis in PAS. Our study revealed that active restoration techniques, such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei, were more effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration. These results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in enhanc-ing plant community diversity and structure in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. © SISEF https://iforest.sisef.org/.

AB  - Zero hunger in 2030 which is one of the SDGs of the UN could be threatened with failure due to man-made conflicts, economic downturn and climate change. On the other hand, forests could be established as a food provider, not just relying on agricultural land. One of the forest products that have the potential for food security is Beneng taro (Xanthosoma undipes K: Koch). Its tubers are used as a source of carbohydrates, while the leaves are used as tobacco substitute and tisane. Although the potential is high, but this plant is still least known. This paper highlights the potentials of X.undipes for maximizing understory yields. The objectives of the research were to: (i) assess the productivity of intercropping X.undipes tuber crop under agroforestry patterns on private forest stands in Sukabumi and (ii) evaluate X.undipes agroforestry development strategy to increase farmers income and its environmental services. The methods used were survey and direct observation on the community forest in Cicantayan Village, Sukabumi District, West Java Province, Indonesia. Swot analysis is used to make strategy in development of beneng taro. As the results Beneng taro were cultivated under fruit trees (mangosteen, coconut, hamlet) and timber stands (Gmelina arborea, Mollucana falcataria, mahogany and African wood). Farmers income from Beneng Taro leaf is 57,600 kg/year/ha. Beneng taro development strategies are optimizing land under private forest stands, strengthening farmer capacity, expanding marketing channels, increasing Small Medium Enterpreneurship-based industries, capital assistance and investor support. The strategic must be integrated across sectors, upstream, middle and downstream, and involve the role of the various parties. © 2025 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assessed the concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 (PM2.5) over South America (SA) based on climatological patterns and trend analysis. This study used monthly PM2.5 data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts from 2003 to 2022. The bilinear interpolation method was applied to the data resampling from 0.75° × 0.75°–0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution, and subsequently, the climatological analysis was performed on seasonal and annual scales of PM2.5 concentrations for the 20-year series. The assessment comprised three main stages: 1) descriptive statistics, 2) seasonal and annual climatology patterns, and 3) trend analysis (Mann-Kendall - MK and Pettitt tests). Results indicated that the largest annual PM2.5 concentrations were found in the Amazon region and northern Paraguay due the El-Niño South Oscillation events (2003–2005, 2007, 2010, 2020, and 2022). The annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the WHO recommended limit (5 μg m−3), ranging from 15.57 μg m−3 (1999) and 22.74 μg m−3 (2007 and 2010). The highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in the Amazon and Chile (Santiago), reaching 160.4 μg m−3 annually and 177.8 μg m−3 seasonally (spring). Elevated seasonal PM2.5 concentrations were attributed to increased deforestation and wildfires associated with meteorological systems such as the Bolivian high and subtropical jets during dry periods (winter and spring). The MK test revealed a significant reduction in PM2.5 concentrations between 2003 and 2022, observed in Argentina (north), Brazil (arc of reforestation), Bolivia (south), and Chile (north). Reduction values varied between 0.5 and 10 μg m−3.year−1 annually and during winter, attributed to no-tillage practices in regions cultivating commodities. The Pettitt test also identified significant structural changes occurring in 2006–2008 and 2010–2011, aligning with areas highlighted in the MK test. This study provides valuable insights for air quality and environmental monitoring managers to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in SA. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 ± 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machine-learning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation. © 2025

AB  - Indonesian peatlands play a critical role in global carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, but they face significant ongoing threat of degradation and loss due to human-induced pressures, including the development of industrial plantations, agricultural expansion, extractive forestry practices, and recurrent fires. The imperative to restore these peatlands is significant, but the restoration effort has, so far, been underwhelming. This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs. This is a critical gap in current research and practice. We illustrate the need for more systemic learning about how peatlands are valued to advance a transition towards healthier peatlands in Indonesia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fire plays a key role in grasslands, determining the distribution and evolution of species and boundaries with neighboring ecosystems. Evidence of community-wide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors, while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked. Here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire (TSF) gradient. We sampled 12 communities in Southern Brazil under varying TSF and calculated taxonomic species richness (S) and dominance (D), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and mean phylogenetic distances (MPD). We used Structural Equation Models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors. Communities with longer TSF presented higher PD and MPD but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance. These sites were dominated by monocots, specifically C4 grasses, but also presented exclusive clades, whereas recently-burned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades. Our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management. Fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical non-forest ecosystems from South America respond differently to fire, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Advanced geospatial analyses have underscored the effectiveness of Indigenous territories in avoiding deforestation, particularly across the tropics. However, the factors that shape such avoidance and their social-ecological contexts are still poorly understood. By using matching methods coupled with community-based and ethnographic approaches, we offer a contextual measure and understanding of deforestation avoidance of Indigenous territories in Southwestern Amazonia. Our counterfactual analysis of 19 Apurinã territories in Brazil over a 20-year period (2001–2021) in different municipalities showed that, even if Indigenous territories are by no means immune to forest loss, they have avoided significant levels of deforestation. Their effectiveness in mitigating deforestation is largely associated with distinct land-based governance, resilient leadership, as well as temporal perspectives and socio-bioeconomies inclusive to more-than-human beings. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Alteromonas macleodii is a heterotrophic marine bacteria abundant in the water column and associated with marine organisms. However, the genomic repertoire associated with this lifestyle is not completely understood. This study aimed to analyze the genome sequences of A. macleodii obtained from two different environmental conditions, Abrolhos Bank (AB), Brazil, and the Persian Gulf (PG), Iran, from seawater and corals. The genomes of seven Alteromonas strains from AB and three from PG were obtained using Illumina sequencing, ranging from 3 to 4.5 Mb (GC% 44.3–45). Different types and numbers of metal resistance, heat-shock, and salt resistance genes were found in the Alteromonas strains, influenced by their specific environmental conditions. Cultures of PG Alteromonas symbionts produced strong antioxidant activity under laboratory conditions, confirmed by the related gene clusters in their genomes. Additionally, higher secondary metabolites, heavy metal resistance, and chemotaxis gene clusters were found. High temperatures and salinity in the PG favor high absorption rates for heavy metals in corals. Cultivable bacteria from corals might benefit from being adapted to high temperatures, nutrients, and heavy metals. In contrast, the AB strains exhibited a different set of adaptive mechanisms, participating in nutrient cycling, including carbohydrate degradation and metabolic interactions, given the milder environmental conditions of the Atlantic Ocean. The genomic repertoire of A. macleodii strains is consistent with both a free-living and a symbiotic lifestyle, potentially contributing to the health of Abrolhos corals in different ways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mangrove crab, Ucides cordatus, plays a relevant role in nutrient cycling in mangroves and is a significant source of food security and income by sustaining the artisanal fishing economy in South America. However, increasing metal contamination threatens the coastal systems, mangrove crabs, and the human population depending on this resource. This study investigates the concentrations of five metals (Al, Co, Fe, Ni, Zn) in the muscle, gills, hepatopancreas, and carapace via metal transfer from the sediment to these crab tissues in “low” and “potentially impacted” areas in the states of Pará and Maranhão on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Our results indicate that Fe (2403.35 mg kg−1 ww) and Zn (65.94 ± 4.48 mg kg−1 ww) levels exceed the most conservative limits established for Fe (EU and FAO/WHO = 45.00 mg kg−1 ww) and Zn (EU and ANVISA = 50.00 mg kg−1 ww), particularly in the gills and hepatopancreas. Bioaccumulation of Zn was observed in all tissues, with this concentration being up to 7.76-fold higher in crab meat. Risk assessment analyses suggest that estimated daily intake values for muscle consumption alone pose no health risk. In contrast, PIS and SIS methods for consuming white and brown meat suggest potential risks. These findings reveal the urgent need for comprehensive assessments of metal contamination in different fish and shellfish species and for improved risk assessment protocols, which are crucial to supporting public health policies and mitigating the impacts of this kind of contamination in mangrove areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Brazil, land conversion and agricultural management have historically accounted for the largest share of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the Cerrado region being one of the most affected areas. Although cropping diversification has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate GHG emissions through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, the long-term effects of these systems in the Cerrado are unknown. The DayCent model was used to simulate the impact of crop diversification and tillage on SOC dynamics until 2070 (∼50 years), including common crop succession systems and crop rotations associated with cover crops under climate change scenarios. First, we calibrated and evaluated the DayCent model using plant and soil observations from three sites in the region, where Pearson coefficients (r values) ranged from 0.50 to 0.94 (calibration sites) and 0.53–0.99 (validation site) for crop yields, SOC, and nitrogen. We then used the model to investigate how cropping systems and climate interact to control SOC levels. Results indicate that SOC stocks would decrease under the long-term (∼50 years) soybean-cotton succession, regardless of soil management (-0.04 to −0.17 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Crop diversification with crop rotation and cover crops (i.e., millet, ruzigrass, sunn hemp) had the highest SOC accrual potential (∼0.71 Mg C ha−1 year−1), resulting in SOC stocks of up to 130 Mg C ha−1 by 2070. Ruzigrass, either single or intercropped with maize on crop succession systems, showed substantial potential for SOC sequestration (∼0.55 Mg C ha−1 year−1) and could be a viable strategy if implementing more complex rotations is not feasible. The SSP2 – 4.5 and SSP5 – 8.5 climate change scenarios increased SOC stocks by 6.3 and 8.2 % in SOC across treatments by 2070, respectively. Results suggest that diversified cropping systems are a promising strategy for increasing SOC sequestration, and they offer valuable guidance for enhancing current management practices in the region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics in terrestrial national parks (TNPs) is crucial for ensuring sustainable environmental management and mitigating the potential negative impacts of short- and long-term disturbances understanding the effect of climate change within natural and protected areas. This study aims to monitor the vegetation dynamics of TNPs in Indonesia by first categorizing them into the regions of Sumatra, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Eastern Indonesia and then applying ready-to-use MODIS EVI time-series imageries (MOD13Q1) taken from 2000 to 2022 on the GEE cloud-computing platform. Specifically, this research investigates the greening and browning fraction trends using Sen's slope, considers seasonality by analyzing the maximum and minimum EVI values, and assesses anomalous years by comparing the annual time series and long-term median EVI value. The findings reveal significantly increasing greening trends in most TNPs, except Danau Sentarum, from 2000 to 2022. The seasonality analysis shows that most TNPs exhibit peak and trough greenness at the end of the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, as the vegetation response to precipitation increases and decreases. Anomalies in seasonality that is affected by climate change was detected in all of the regions. To increase TNPs resilience, suggested measures include active reforestation and implementation of Assisted Natural Regeneration, strengthen the enforcement of fundamental managerial task, and forest fire management. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - There is interest in assessing the potential climate mitigation benefit of coastal wetlands based on the balance between their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration. Here we investigated soil GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) on mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and across common land use impacts including shrimp farms and a pasture. We found greater methane fluxes near the Amazon River mouth (1439 to 3312 μg C m−2 h−1), which on average are equivalent to 37% of mangrove C sequestration in the region. Soil CO2 fluxes were predominant in mangrove forests to the East of the Amazon Delta. Land use change shifted mangroves from C sinks (mean sequestration of 12.2 ± 1.4 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr-1) to net GHG sources (mean loss of 8.0 ± 3.3 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1). Our data suggests that mangrove forests in the Amazon can aid decreasing the net annual emissions in the Brazilian forest sector in 9.7 ± 0.8 Tg CO2e yr−1 through forest conservation and avoided deforestation. © 2024

AB  - Forests significantly contribute to climate change mitigation by acting as carbon sinks, sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, and keeping it in soil and biomass. Covering 22 % of its land, African forests offer numerous benefits to millions of people. Nevertheless, they face threats from human activities like deforestation and degradation. A holistic approach encompassing social, economic, and environmental factors is necessary to sustain forests as carbon sinks for maximum carbon sequestration potential. This study used carbon dioxide emissions, forest loss and gain, and land use change to investigate the level of carbon dioxide emissions and their relationship to forest loss and climate change in Africa from 1992 to 2020. Using ArcGIS, land use change was reclassified, InVEST model calculated carbon storage and sequestration, and annual changes in forest cover were assessed using the K and S indices. In the last two decades, 77.36 % of African countries had greater forest losses than gains, leading to 32 × 103 kha net loss, resulting in 15.73 Pg C of carbon dioxide emissions. Annual forest loss rate is 1.6 × 103 kha, equivalent to 0.786 Pg C, and that of carbon storage and sequestration decreased to −0.69 and −1.37, respectively. Results indicate that deforestation, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, significantly contributes to carbon emissions, and persistent tropical deforestation will affect future greenhouse gas concentrations. This research provides a detailed spatiotemporal analysis, highlighting areas experiencing severe forest cover change and carbon loss, underscoring the importance of forest conservation in mitigating climate change, and promoting effective land management policies. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Over the past three decades, a new ‘haze season’ has emerged in the public discourse in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The semantic construction of ‘haze season’ signifies societal acknowledgement of recurring and hazardous air pollution episodes caused by the widespread burning of tropical peatlands. This study problematizes the underlying political ecology of the discursive framing of haze as ‘seasonal.’ Through a comprehensive discourse analysis of news media and government/corporate/NGO documents, this paper identifies and analyses three storylines used by divergent groups of actors seeking to attribute meaning and value to haze: (1) ‘it keeps coming back’; (2) ‘it will go away’; and (3) ‘it is normal’. Political actors draw upon these storylines to meet their distinctive political and ecological objectives. Divergent framing of seasonality by different actors reveals some of the mechanisms influencing haze mitigation and adaptation. Our study highlights the importance of unearthing and interrogating the underlying politics involved in constructing ‘seasons of the Anthropocene’. The semantic construction and popularization of ‘seasonality’ for anthropogenic environmental events can be a double-edged sword, with familiarity enhancing societal preparedness, while normalization can lead to desensitization and inertia towards mitigation. Untangling the divergent pathways of politicizing Anthropocene seasonalities is key to determining whether and how societies can build a ‘liveable future’. © 2024 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Eco-DRR is a holistic, ecosystem-based approach that utilizes ecosystems to sustainably mitigate the effects of natural disasters. This study analyses the Eco-DRR praxis at mangrove ecosystems at North Jakarta. The research employs semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants to reveal the mangrove management in the urbanized area of North Jakarta. The data collected are verified through triangulation of data sources. The sustainability of mangrove is assessed using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Rapfish Analysis. Additionally, comparative analysis is conducted by contrasting the two revealing findings of mangrove sustainability in protected and unprotected areas. The findings reveal that protected mangrove areas exhibit higher sustainability compared to unprotected ones distinguished by its Eco-DRR praxis. This research suggests that Eco-DRR praxis such as mangrove conservation, effectively minimize tidal flood risk, generate ecosystem services, and perform as an indicator to sustain the environment. The government policies govern the management of protected areas, emphasizing their role in providing ecosystem services and mitigating tidal floods. In contrast, unprotected areas face challenges due to less effective management, leading to suboptimal ecosystem services and reduced disaster risk reduction capacity. The key takeaway is the significance of community-based organizations, in enhancing and sustaining mangrove ecosystems, with strong participation and involvement among various stakeholders, ensures the services of mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas, contributing to Eco-DRR and long-term environmental resilience. The praxis of Eco-DRR in the North Jakarta, Indonesia is geographically contextualized, where local praxis, policy reform, and knowledge basis in essential to support its sustainability. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp., Mirtaceae) stands out for its remarkable regeneration capacity, making it a valuable tool for recovering degraded areas and for reforestation. Despite its Australian origins, eucalyptus has shown remarkable adaptation to the Brazilian tropical climate, contributing to the wood productivity of the country. However, the extensive monoculture of eucalyptus can increase pest incidence, thus being a significant challenge for the forestry sector, which suffers production losses of up to 30%. We analyzed the occurrence of 11 pest insect species in 450 eucalyptus stands over 9 years in the southeastern region of Brazil in our study. We related pest occurrences to specific year periods and climatic variations using circular uniformity analysis and zero-inflated models. We found that the species generally had isolated peaks of occurrence during the year and that the increase in the occurrence of at least five species was related to temperature or precipitation. The results highlight the sensitivity of pests to climatic conditions, showing the importance of management strategies to ensure the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations. We can develop more effective management strategies by understanding how these variables interact with insect populations, contributing to the sustainability and productivity of eucalyptus plantations with less aggressive environmental practices. © Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil 2024.

AB  - Mangrove restoration projects in Indonesia are widely conducted in abandoned aquaculture ponds, however the success of planting mangroves is limited as tidal flooding is often not considered. The hydrology of mangrove surrounding water is both complex and dynamic and creates tide-induced flow and mangrove vegetation interaction that influences hydrological suitability of mangrove species. In this study, we aimed to determine the hydrological suitability for specific mangrove species in mangrove restoration efforts in abandoned aquaculture ponds by measuring tidal inundation duration in mangrove waters. The study was undertaken in two restored mangroves sites in abandoned ponds in Perancak estuary, Bali and Lubuk Kertang, North Sumatra, which was combined with measurements of intact mangroves for comparison. Tidal flooding (inundation and current velocity) was recorded to obtain flooding period measurements (depth, duration and tidal velocity) in association with mangrove succession rates. We found that the variability of tidal flooding between study sites was found to determine dominant mangrove species, suggesting a mangrove species-specific tolerance to tidal flooding in establishing habitats. Among the species observed, Nypa fruticans was found to be the most resilient to prolonged tidal inundations. Rhizophora spp., Avicennia spp., Sonneratia alba, however, adapted to a wider range of inundation periods. The tidal inundation in restored mangrove ponds was characterized by low current velocities, which provides suitable conditions for mangrove recovery in restoration sites. This information on hydrological classification proves that the effectiveness of mangrove restoration projects can be improved by highlighting the necessity to account for localized tidal inundation regimes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of prolonged sugarcane cultivation on the pedo-morphological characteristics and physicochemical properties of three soil types: Entisols, Inceptisols, and Vertisols, as a basis for determining the improvement step ensuring the sustainability of sugarcane production in Indonesia. Soil samples were collected from fields of sugarcane cultivated for 10, 20, and 30 years to analyse pedo-morphological and physicochemical properties. The results indicate that while Entisols and Inceptisols exhibited significant changes in soil properties with increasing cultivation duration, the pedo-morphology of Vertisols remained relatively stable. All soil types developed Ap horizons due to sugarcane cultivation, with anthropogenic practices leading to more dynamic changes in surface horizons. Extended cultivation reduced soil organic matter, N-total, and available nitrogen, while phosphorus and exchangeable cation availability were influenced by mineral composition. Notably, cation exchange capacity (CEC) decreased in Entisols and Inceptisols but increased in Vertisols. For productivity, Vertisols demonstrated the most stable and highest sugarcane productivity with long-term monoculture cultivation. There is a need for tailored sustainable soil management across different soil types and practices to mitigate soil degradation and maintain nutrient availability to ensure the sustainability of sugarcane production in Indonesia. © The authors.

AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Building circular economic systems is crucial to address ecological challenges like climate change. The twin transition suggests that, to maximize the impact of sustainable solutions, humans and (disruptive) technologies need to be effectively integrated. Methods to conceptually build such (eco)systems integrating these and assess their ecological impact before implementation are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the Circulise framework, a model-driven method designed to build circular systems and evaluate their environmental performance. The approach promotes design-thinking to create socio-technical ecosystems that can be evaluated at the light of their alignment with circular economy and/or sustainability principles and be used to generate operational software behavior. The Circulise framework was developed following the methodological guidance of design science research. It is applied in this paper to the case of Fanyatu, a non-profit organization focused on reforestation in the Congo Basin, showing its ability to create a circular ecosystem not only supporting the creation of regenerative CO2-absorbing forests but also empowering and improving the quality of life of the local communities involved in the planting of trees. In Fanyatu's case, Circulise's strategic planning and technology integration lead to virtuous cycles, enabling a snowball effect in forest creation and the promotion of sustainable projects. The framework's scalability and versatility allow it to be applied across various contexts, enabling the creation of customized circular ecosystems for sustainability tailored to specific human and technological needs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been a promising alternative to mitigate the impacts of intensive use of agricultural inputs in coffee plantations and preserve the soil microbiota. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of coffee AFSs on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community, aiming to optimize or validate an agroecological and sustainable system for coffee cultivation in a conservation area located in the Maciço de Baturité region, Ceará state, Brazil. Soil and root samples were obtained in an AFS with coffee cultivated in the Natural/Wild system, an AFS undergoing conversion to the syntropic system, and a conventional AFS. Spore counting, mycorrhizal colonization percentage, and AMF sequencing using the Illumina Miseq platform after DNA extraction and amplification were performed on the samples. Syntropic AFS and conventional AFS showed the highest values of mycorrhizal colonization. However, no differences were observed in the number of glomerospores and beta diversity data among the three AFSs. Around 80 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified in the AFSs. Syntropic AFS had a higher number of ASVs than the other AFSs. These results show that agroecosystem management can influence AMF communities. Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were the most abundant AMF families in the AFSs. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Tirsyayu T, Soma AS, Paembonan SA. 2025. Land use direction based on landslide susceptibility levels in the Rongkong Watershed, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Asian J For 9: 53-66. Landslides, a common natural disaster in Indonesia, cause significant material and non-material losses. Mitigation efforts, including the provision of accurate information about landslide-prone areas and appropriate land-use recommendations, are crucial for minimizing their impact. This study, which analyzed landslide susceptibility using the frequency ratio method integrated with GIS technology, provides confidence in its methodology. The research, which began with data collection on landslide occurrences through imagery, identified 388 landslide points. These data were divided into two groups: validation data (20%) and training data (80%). The validation process, using the ROC curve, yielded an AUC value of 0.81, indicating the effectiveness of the frequency ratio method in predicting landslide occurrences in the Rongkong Watershed, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The study revealed that parameters such as rainfall, slope gradient, land cover, elevation, lithology, curvature, and slope aspect significantly influence landslides in the Rongkong Watershed. In contrast, parameters such as distance from rivers, distance from roads, and NDVI had less influence. The study's findings, which classified landslide susceptibility levels as very high (1.32%), high (29.05%), and moderate (25.70%) based on the total area of the Rongkong Watershed, are of significant importance. They suggest that land us e in areas with very high and high susceptibility should be designated for conservation or protected zones. In comparison, areas with moderate susceptibility can be utilized for limited and controlled cultivation, such as implementing agroforestry systems. © 2025, Smujo International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Fire significantly transforms ecology and landscapes worldwide, impacting carbon cycling, species interactions, and ecosystem functions. In the Brazilian Cerrado, a fire-dependent savanna, the interaction between fire, society, and the environment is evident. Given that wildfires significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, our study aimed to analyze four decades of burned area data to understand changes in fire dynamics, using Collection 2 of annual MapBiomas Fire maps (1985 to 2022). Our study examined spatiotemporal patterns, fire recurrence, fire distribution across land uses, temporal changes in fire scar size, burned area variations across ecoregions, and their correlation with farming areas. Results: From 1985 to 2022, fire impacted 40% (792,204 km2) of the Cerrado biome, with 63% burning more than once. Natural vegetation was the most affected, primarily due to human-driven ignition during the dry season. A noticeable trend of later peaks in fire activity, concentrated towards the end of the dry season, along with an increase in patch size over time, characterized a clear shift in the Cerrado fire regime. Recently, the MATOPIBA region and the northern biome exhibited significant fire clusters, with burned areas rising alongside farming expansion. The ecoregion-based analysis identified fire hotspots, with the "Bananal" ecoregion, the largest wetland area in the biome, exhibiting increased fire recurrence and larger patch size over time. Conclusions: Our four-decade analysis of fire dynamics in the Cerrado revealed human-induced changes in the fire regime, originally shifting from July to September to a new fire season from August to October. This shift poses several environmental threats given their overlap with the driest months of the year. This study improved our understanding of changes in fire patterns and their impacts on each ecoregion and land use. Wetlands experienced the highest relative burned area, highlighting their ecological importance and increased vulnerability. In the southern Cerrado, where farming is established and natural vegetation more fragmented, fire events tend to decrease; while in the north, with recent farming expansion, fire susceptibility rises. Conservation-oriented strategies, like the Brazilian Integrated Fire Management (MIF), are crucial for mitigating impacts while enhancing the Cerrado’s resilience to climate change. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C-2 °C goals. However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics—including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach—BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering—or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 °C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Mitigation actions to address climate change are essential to prevent future adverse impacts, with woody species in forests playing a pivotal role in carbon storage, as exemplified by the agroforestry systems commonly practiced in community forests of Bogor Regency, which integrate woody species and crops. This study aimed to analyze changes in vegetation density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach, analyze stand structure and composition, and estimate above-ground carbon stocks in the agroforestry land of community forest in Tenjolaya Sub-District, Bogor Regency. The methods used were spatial analysis with NDVI, vegetation analysis, and carbon stock estimation using allometric and destructive methods. The plot size was 50 m × 50 m, totaling 21 plots. NDVI analysis resulted in low density (0.59–0.67), moderate density (0.67–0.78), and high density (0.78–0.85). This study found 178 plant species across 40 families, with Fabaceae and Myrtaceae being the most dominant. The carbon stock is 27.69 tons carbon/ha. Carbon stock is significantly influenced by tree density, number of species, and basal area values. A well-managed community forest has high ecological, economic, and social potential through the development of agroforestry, which can maintain biodiversity and environmental sustainability while storing carbon stocks. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Farmers in tropical Indonesia who manage agroecological systems face multiple challenges related to food security. Despite the conditions caused by climate change, these farming households have effectively utilized agroforestry to build food security. However, prolonged dry seasons pose new constraints to their livelihood strategies. This study uses a qualitative methodology and a rural farmer livelihood framework to analyze and evaluate household livelihood strategies, attitudes, and reactions to climate change. The findings show that farmers constantly modify their management techniques using flexible and adaptive decision-making processes to cope with and minimize climate change challenges. Moreover, the role of climate variation as a significant catalyst for change in farming practices is challenging to distinguish from some of the routine problems that farmers face each year. Through knowledge accumulation and adaptive management, farmers in Enrekang utilize several livelihood adaptation strategies to reduce risks in the face of changing climate conditions. In addition, farmers utilize on-farm crops to obtain various ecosystem services that provide services such as food, nutrition, and medicine and improve ecology, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Further research is needed to understand how on-farm tree inclusion affects various biophysical properties and the rationale behind species selection. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - CONTEXT: Climate-smart agricultural systems must mitigate climate change and adapt to it. OBJECTIVES: (i) test the ability of a silvopastoral system (SPS) in Brazil to neutralize the CH4 enteric emission by tree carbon (C) assimilation, considering solely the stem-C destined to Products with Higher Added Value (HVAP) and furniture as valid, due to their long-term stability; (ii) test the SPS ability to provide increased animal thermal comfort and; (iii) compare the SPS productivity, animal thermal comfort and CH4 emission with a full sun system (FS). METHODS: The systems had four areas managed under rotational stocking with beef cattle and were established with Piatã palisadegrass [Urochloa brizantha Stapf cv. BRS Piatã] in 2007. In the SPS, eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus urograndis clone GG100) were planted in 2011, in single east-west oriented rows, with a 15 m × 2 m spacing, and thinned to 15 m × 4 m spacing in 2016. Microclimate data were collected in weather stations to determine the Black Globe and Humidity Index (BGHI). The CH4 enteric emission was estimated using the Tier-2 equation (IPCC Methodological Guide - 2019). Tree height and diameter at breast height were measured every six months from October/2017 to April/2019 to estimate the stem biomass using an allometric equation. The stem biomass was multiplied by its carbon content and by 40 % to consider the break-through yield in sawmill. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: BGHI was lower in the SPS than in the FS. Even considering the stem-C appropriate for HVAP and furniture in a SPS with a stocking rate 256 % greater than the Brazilian average, 77 % of the CH4 enteric emission was offset. When considering all the stem-C, the net C balance was −14.28 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 year−1. SIGNIFICANCE: SPS are interesting alternatives to mitigate climate change while providing satisfactory animal production and increased animal thermal comfort. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the Pampa biome is still inadequate, with a gap in the knowledge of the successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration. Thus, monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration, as well as to ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for adaptive management actions. In this study, the progression of the techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was investigated using ecological indicators. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, in an area of riparian forest. The region belongs to the Pampa biome, southern Brazil. The evaluations took place in two different monitoring periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2021, in two areas, one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other under passive restoration. Ecological indicators of composition, structure, and function were measured, sampled in 10 plots through monitoring per area. The results showed significant differences between the monitoring periods in each area by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). The areas presented differences in floristic composition between monitoring periods by non-metric scaling analysis (nMDS), and differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER). The dendrometric variables (height, diameter, breast height, nuclei area, and crown area) presented a significant difference by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) in the evaluation of the development of the nuclei. The ecological indicators of structure (canopy cover, soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area under restoration by applied nucleation. In the area under passive restoration, the indicators of structure (litter thickness and soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period. In both areas, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. was the species that most contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring moments. In the development of the nuclei, the dendrometric variables were statistically superior in the second monitoring period, pointing to progression in the development of the nuclei. It is concluded that the restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied area, as the nuclei progress over time. The area under passive restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession. The study result provide support for the improvement in future restoration projects for riparian areas in the Pampa biome. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines the evolution of community preparedness and mitigation systems in Aceh, Indonesia, over the past two decades since the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of the progress in disaster preparedness and explores the complex interplay between land use changes and disaster resilience. This exploration is particularly focused on the impacts of rapid population growth and urban development in tsunami-prone coastal areas. The study synthesizes insights from a variety of literature on post-tsunami developments in Aceh and includes direct interviews with survivors to enrich the analysis. The paper investigates ongoing efforts to anticipate and mitigate future tsunami threats, considering Aceh's unique cultural and habitual dynamics. It highlights the significant strides made in enhancing community preparedness and identifies the challenges faced in strengthening disaster resilience. Key areas of focus include initiatives to improve community readiness, the development of evacuation facilities, and the implementation of additional mitigation measures such as coastal forest restoration. Furthermore, the paper addresses critical issues for future resilience, such as managing the effects of population growth and urbanization in vulnerable coastal regions. Through a detailed analysis, the paper illuminates both the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in the continuous journey toward bolstering disaster resilience. The insights derived from this study offer a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in disaster preparedness and provide valuable lessons for other disaster-prone regions worldwide. By examining these aspects, the study contributes to ongoing efforts to safeguard communities and adapt to evolving disaster risks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Gum rosin, a distillation product of pine sap with turpentine as a co-product, is a significant non-timber forest product (NTFP) in Indonesia. This study evaluated the social sustainability of gum rosin production across four factories in Central Java during a three-year period of 2020–2022 through a Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). The study focused on social performance and identifying social hotspots using the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM) based on basic requirements. Data collection involved reviews of documents, reports, and records of the organization with triangulation interviews and surveys of other stakeholders to validate data in the inventory analysis. The results indicated that all factories met the basic requirements in the majority of subcategories for all stakeholder groups involved. Each stakeholder group had specific subcategories requiring improvement, such as “working hours,” “fair wages,” and “health and safety” for forestry workers; “access to material resources” for local communities; “promoting social responsibility” for value chain actors; and “transparency” for consumers. These areas were found to not meet basic standards and need specific improvements. These findings are intended to support the government, as the industry's sole shareholder, in developing strategies for its future growth while recognizing the potential of pine sap to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. While this study focuses on industry activities, future research should expand its scope to include the broader social impacts of sustainable forest management more comprehensively. © 2025 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, economies, and biodiversity, particularly in fire-prone regions like the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Tropical forest regions are home to ambitious large-scale restoration programs, such as Initiative 20 × 20 and AFR100. Concomitantly, much research has been done in these regions in recent decades. We performed a systematic review of scientific publications on tropical forest restoration worldwide, aiming to identify knowledge gaps and where research is concentrated. We compiled scientific articles on tropical forest restoration in English, available in Scopus, and analyzed them through time via citation counts, topic, biome, country, and authorship networks. We found 1476 articles with 38,038 citations, indicating that we have accumulated a great amount of scientific knowledge on tropical forest restoration so far, especially in the last 15 years (89% of all articles). However, publications are unequally distributed. Whereas articles were published in 71 of 120 tropical countries/territories, Brazil (376 articles), Mexico (163 articles), and Costa Rica (116 articles) accounted for 44% of publications. There was also a disparity in authorship; some countries have mostly lead authors belonging to national institutions while others have mostly foreign lead authors. Montane and dry forests were notably less studied than lowland and wet forests. The most studied topics were the technical, ecological, and biophysical aspects of restoration (83% of articles). Publication counts incompletely represent accumulated knowledge, but our results provide an indication of relative scholarship across biomes, topics, political units, and scientific leadership roles. From these, future research will be justified in moving forward in the areas of climate change, sociology, culture, and economics, and with local scientific leadership, particularly in Africa. © 2025 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The forest ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil are experiencing intense deforestation, contributing to climate change. Valuing the ecosystem service of CO2 sequestration can help in environmental policies to reduce deforestation and promote ecological restoration in this region. In this study, we sought to understand the dynamics of land use and land cover in the Atlantic Forest region of the state of Sergipe between 1985 and 2021 and to simulate land use and land cover for 2031 and 2051, assuming the current business as usual (BAU) trend was used as a reference scenario. The results showed that the agriculture-pasture mosaic class obtained the greatest percentage (5.27 %) and net (around 514.00 km²) increase among the land use and cover classes evaluated in the study area between 1985 and 2021. In the BAU scenario, total emissions reach 1,137,942.07 Mg CO2 in 2031 and 692,815.16 Mg CO2 in 2051, imposing an opportunity cost for society of US$ 7.94 million and US$ 4.35 million, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Context: Sustainable agricultural practices are critical in a world grappling with climate change and pressure on natural resources. Unplanned agricultural expansion often harms ecosystems and the services they provide. Balancing food production with environmental protection demands sophisticated tools like spatial analysis and artificial intelligence to inform land-use decisions. Objective: This study introduces an AI-driven process to assess land suitability for agrosilvopastoral systems, going beyond traditional methods by incorporating a broader spectrum of landscape characteristics. Our approach integrates climate, water resources, soil properties, morphological features, and accessibility to enhance the accuracy of suitability mapping. Methods: We constructed a data cube comprising 100 geospatial layers representing diverse landscape attributes. Field observations from two watersheds in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used to train and validate a Random Forest classification model. We evaluated the model's accuracy and quantified the influence of each attribute group on suitability determination. Results: Integrating climate, water, edaphic, and morphological attributes significantly improved the model's accuracy and provided a more nuanced understanding of agrosilvopastoral suitability compared to using only soil class, lithology, and slope. Climate and edaphic variables emerged as key drivers of suitability. This approach identified a more constrained, yet potentially more sustainable, distribution of suitable land. Significance: Our findings highlight the need to transition from conventional land suitability assessments towards more holistic, data-driven approaches that consider the complex interplay of environmental factors. This model offers a valuable tool for guiding sustainable land-use planning, potentially mitigating environmental impacts while optimizing agrosilvopastoral production. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Juçara palm (Euterpe edulis Mart.) is a native species of the Atlantic Forest biome, with high commercial value due to, among other uses, the extraction of the palm heart and pulp. This species has essential ecological interaction with fauna, providing food for many frugivorous species. However, it is on the list of endangered species, mainly due to the disorderly exploration of the palm tree for the extraction of the palm heart, but also due to climate change, habitat fragmentation, and defaunation. In this context, understanding which areas are suitable to grow this species is important for planning and supporting decision-making, as well as delimiting areas environmentally suitable according to the optimal requirements of species and land-use occupation. Our aim was to identify the suitable areas to cultivate Juçara palm in the State of Rio de Janeiro and provide a set of supporting maps and information for this productive sector, to increase agroforestry systems, or even for forest conservation and restoration purposes. Environmental parameters for the species (soil, elevation, air temperature and rainfall), and land use and land cover were assessed in order to perform the mapping of the optimal areas. The results indicate a potential for cultivation of Juçara palm in the State of Rio de Janeiro. All regions of the State have suitable areas, especially the Médio Vale do Paraíba, Centro–Sul, and Baixadas Litorâneas. The most restrictive variables to grow Juçara Palm in Rio de Janeiro State were rainfall and inadequate land use/cover for planting. © 2025, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a global priority for recovering degraded areas and mitigating climate change. However, climate change can impact the long-term effectiveness of restoration efforts. This study evaluated the effects of climate change on restoration planning, focusing on water quality in the Doce River basin, the site of Brazil’s largest environmental tragedy and the most significant mining disaster globally, with the release of approximately 50 million cubic metres of iron ore tailings into the environment. Sediment exportation was used as a criterion for assessing water quality under three climate scenarios. Restoration of riparian vegetation reduced sediment exportation by 75.29% but was insufficient to fully control erosion, particularly in the upper basin, where increased precipitation could exacerbate the problem. The findings underscore the risks of ignoring climate change in restoration planning. Adaptive strategies are essential to ensure long-term benefits and address climate challenges, fostering more resilient and sustainable ecosystems. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2025.

AB  - Tropical forests, housing about two-thirds of Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity, face significant deforestation and fragmentation, leading to the loss of over half their area. Conservation and restoration efforts are crucial, especially for regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which suffers with a reduction in biomass and species diversity. The Brazilian agroforest system, typical from the region of Southern Bahia called “cabruca”, are helping to mitigate these effects by combining cocoa cultivation with forest management, enhancing both socio-economic and environmental benefits. In a study focusing on Plathymenia reticulata, a tree species native to the Atlantic Forest, we evaluated the effectiveness of the cabruca agroforest system versus the natural forest for maintaining genetic diversity and landscape connectivity. Results showed that cabruca systems, while managed, exhibit a level of genetic diversity compared to natural forests. However, forest populations remain critical for their genetic reservoirs and adaptability. The cabrucas agroforest system also showed higher inbreeding levels, emphasizing the need for effective management to reduce inbreeding risks. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid urbanization process in recent decades has altered the carbon cycle and exacerbated the impact of climate change, prompting many cities to develop tree planting and green area preservation as mitigation and adaptation measures. While numerous studies have estimated the carbon stocks of urban trees in temperate and subtropical cities, data from tropical regions, including tropical botanic gardens, are scarce. This study aimed to quantify the aboveground biomass and carbon (AGB and AGC, respectively) stocks in trees at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden arboretum, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our survey included 6793 stems with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm. The total AGB was 8047 ± 402 Mg, representing 4024 ± 201 Mg of AGC. The AGB density was 207 ± 10 Mg·ha−1 (AGC = 104 ± 5 Mg·ha−1), which is slightly lower than the density stored in Brazil’s main forest complexes, the Atlantic and Amazon forests, but much higher than in many cities worldwide. Our results suggest that, in addition to their global importance for plant conservation, tropical botanic gardens could function as significant carbon sinks within the urban matrix. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Soil compaction, a result of mechanical resistance to penetration, has a direct impact on yield potential by limiting root access to water and nutrients. Factors such as inadequate crop rotation, intensive mechanization, and trampling by animals contribute to compaction. Mitigation strategies include crop rotation, control of machinery traffic, the use of cover crops, and the use of mechanical techniques. Geostatistical methods in pedostatistics evaluate the spatial variability of soil properties. The aim of this study was to determine the penetration resistance in five soil layers (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm), identify critical compaction regions, and quantify the economic impact of compaction management in a 230 ha farm in Alegrete, Brazil. A digital penetrometer was used to measure resistance and semivariograms were calculated using classical and robust estimators for interpolation. The evaluation of the economic impact took into account the variable cost differences between the total area and the area required for compaction. The analysis showed a gradual increase in compaction from the surface to the subsoil, with a highly compacted zone occurring at 20–30 cm, signaling the need for monitoring and intervention. The dependency analysis showed a well-defined structure. The results show that geostatistical tools can be used in the assessment of soil penetration resistance, especially in layers from 10 to 20 cm. An efficient identification and quantification of compacted zones within the cultivation area was achieved. This approach proves to be economically viable, especially in extensive farming, suggesting a wide application in agricultural compaction management. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation’s long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 − 70.02 Mg CO2 ha− 1 and stored 30.54 × 104 − 54.07 × 104 MJ ha− 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 ± 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 ± 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide important services in mitigating global climate change while delivering various co-benefits at the local level. However, they are subjected to multiple anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to several investigations aimed at addressing these threats and/or restoring them. This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes. The key findings of this study provide valuable insights into (1) mangrove cover changes over time, (2) proximate and underlying drivers of these changes, and (3) land use and land cover maps highlighting mangroves in less-explored sites. These local-scale observations offer global perspectives on the long-term effects of natural disasters and sustained mangrove restoration efforts on mangrove blue carbon. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Decades of deforestation and unsustainable land use have created extensive areas of degraded and deforested land across the central Congo Basin, contributing substantially to climate change and biodiversity loss. Recently, nature-based solutions have gained increasing interest, particularly those focusing on forest restoration for long-term carbon sequestration and additional societal benefits for human well-being. Thus, forest restoration, especially with native species, offers a viable pathway to address environmental and social challenges while supporting local communities. However, both technical and scientific knowledge about many native species' performance in large-scale plantations, which could serve the current and future needs of central African countries, is currently lacking. To address these knowledge gaps, we established an experimental plantation in Yangambi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to evaluate the potential of native tree species in comparison with the fast-growing exotic species Acacia auriculiformis, which is often planted in monoculture at a large-scale in the central Congo Basin. From 37 promising native species initially selected, the seeds of 19 were successfully harvested from the natural forest. Among these, 16 species yielded sufficient seedlings in the nursery and were planted in the field. After five years, five native species (Pachyelasma tessmannii, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Irvingia smithii, Ongokea gore, and Canarium schweinfurthii) demonstrated growth, survival, and carbon sequestration performance comparable to Acacia auriculiformis. This illustrates that local tree species are promising alternatives for exotic species. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to optimize the large-scale production of native seedlings, including improving seed conservation and nursery techniques. Drawing on the ongoing forest restoration initiatives in Yangambi, we emphasize the importance of integrating local knowledge and actively involving local communities to ensure the successful implementation and long-term sustainability of tree-planting efforts, benefiting both nature and human well-being. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Drainage and deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) in Southeast Asia cause carbon emissions and biodiversity loss of global concern. Restoration efforts to mitigate these impacts usually involve peatland rewetting by blocking canals. However, there have been no studies to date of the optimal rewetting approach that will reduce carbon emission whilst also promoting PSF regeneration. Here we present results of a large-scale restoration trial in Sumatra (Indonesia), monitored for 7.5 years. Water levels in a former plantation were raised over an area of 4800 ha by constructing 257 compacted peat dams in canals. We find peat surface subsidence rates in the rewetted restoration area and adjoining PSF to be halved where water tables were raised from ~ − 0.6 m to ~ − 0.3 m, demonstrating the success of rewetting in reducing carbon emission. A total of 57 native PSF tree species were found to spontaneously grow in the most rewetted conditions and in high densities, indicating that forest regrowth is underway. Based on our findings we propose that an effective PSF restoration strategy should follow stepwise rewetting to achieve substantial carbon emission reduction alongside unassisted regrowth of PSF, thereby enabling the peat, forest and canal vegetation to establish a new nature-based ecosystem balance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production. A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia—rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 ± 149.05 Mg C ha−1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 ± 188.14 Mg C ha−1) or polyculture (105.12 ± 48.65 Mg C ha−1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Indonesia, one of the countries with the most extensive tropical forests in the world, plays a crucial role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research explores forestry policies that can be adopted in Indonesia to support the SDGs, particularly those related to sustainable forest management, climate change, and partnerships to achieve the goals. Using a qualitative approach, this research analyses existing forestry policies with a focus on implementation challenges at the local level and the interaction of global policies with socio-political dynamics at the regional level. The research findings indicate that adopting REDD+-based policies (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) can be a strategic step in supporting environmental sustainability. Still, its success highly depends on the support of various stakeholders at the local level. It is essential to have synergy between the government, indigenous communities, and the private sector to ensure inclusive and sustainable forest management. The alignment between policies and local culture, especially the traditional forest management practices that local communities have carried out for generations. This is necessary to address various challenges that arise in the field implementation of policies. Thus, an inclusive and collaborative approach to implementing forestry policies in Indonesia becomes a critical factor in supporting the achievement of the SDGs, particularly in sustainable forest management. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2025.

AB  - The semi-deciduous Brazilian Atlantic Forest has faced intense fragmentation, impacting Metrodorea nigra St. Hill., a fly-pollinated and autochorous tree. We investigated population structure, inbreeding, and spatial genetic structure (SGS) across adult (Adu) and juvenile (Juv) generations in three fragmented populations of M. nigra in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. We tested whether the magnitude of these effects could result from its mating system, seed dispersal, anthropogenic disturbances, matrix, and fragment size. Populations affected by selective logging, fire, and trail openings include M13-Rib (84 ha) and FAC-Crav (8 ha), both surrounded by sugar cane and BSQ-Rib (3 ha) in an urban matrix. We evaluated phenological events and germination rates in the BSQ-Rib fragment. We sampled leaves and amplified their DNA using ISSR (UBC 1, 2, 820, 834, 851, 858, 860, 886) and SSR (Mtn 1, 3, 13, 16, 19, 87, 95) molecular markers. Fst, PCoA, and AMOVA values suggest a lack of generational isolation, with most variance within generations. Inbreeding values were significant in all populations (Fis and Fit, p = 0.001), probably intensified by natural seed dispersal and pollinator behavior favoring geitonogamy. However, fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbances, and the surrounding matrix influenced SGS. The urban BSQ-Rib fragment recorded the highest SGS values (26 m Juv, 24 m Adu [ISSR]; 7 m Juv, 9 m Adu [SSR]), which may result in low fruit and seed production and germination rates. Despite being the largest fragment, M13-Rib shows SGS in the first distance class (19 m Juv, 24 m Adu [ISSR]; 0 m Juv, and 10 m Adu [SSR]), possibly due to selective logging and fire. FAC-Crav, a more conserved fragment, showed no SGS in adults but punctual SGS in juveniles (27 m [ISSR] and 8 m [SSR]), pointing to it as a promising source for seed collections for reforestation purposes. In summary, inbreeding in M. nigra, influenced by pollinator behavior and seed dispersal, along with fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbances, and the surrounding matrix, are critical in shaping SGS. These factors potentially impact the reproductive success of M. nigra and their long-term survival in the face of climate change. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Peatlands are crucial yet vulnerable carbon stores. Here, we investigated carbon biogeochemical processes in tropical peatlands converted to plantations. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radiocarbon content in an experimental Acacia crassicarpa plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. We found exceptionally high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, and CH4 in porewater and drainage networks, indicating that Acacia plantations are carbon hotspots due to their high productivity and exposed carbon-dense substrates. Stable isotope models revealed that while CO2 and CH4 are produced belowground, CH4 contribution was lower than in natural undrained peatlands. Radiocarbon analysis suggested that remobilized carbon contributed to the carbon pool, with a median age of ∼470 years before present. These findings constrain the links between land-use, water table levels, and carbon dynamics, with implications for carbon management in plantation peatlands. © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Modern agriculture has had to face complex environmental issues, many of which result from land use, which includes the degradation of its fertility properties. Soil quality is fundamental to the sustainability of the planet, as it also affects other natural resources. Therefore, it must be seen as a fundamental action for the sustainability of the planet and be evaluated using methodologies capable of holistically relating the environmental impacts of production systems, as does the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. However, due to the lack of suitable models, LCA is still ineffective in assessing soil quality. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the use of chemical soil quality indicators in the context of LCA, contributing new information to the debate. To this end, a set of soil quality indicators from the APOIA-NovoRural method were applied in some agricultural production systems in southern Brazil. Thus, the LCA results confirmed soil quality maintenance activities as those that most contribute to impacts, particularly in the categories of climate change, (eco)toxicities and land use. However, the indicators efficiently contributed direct information about the agricultural environment, relating them to the impacts estimated by the LCA. Therefore, the use of indicators makes it possible to improve soil management by adjusting chemical parameters, accurately contextualizing activities, and use of inputs to the real conditions of the area assessed. Thus, we demonstrate that indicators can be useful in providing information for agricultural environmental management in interrelation with LCA, whose application alone is not yet capable of achieving such results. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The expansion of agricultural frontiers in the Amazon region poses a significant threat to forest conservation and biodiversity persistence. This study focuses on Pará state, Brazil, aiming to identify and characterize the predominant production systems by combining remote sensing data and landscape structure metrics. A rule-based classification tree algorithm is applied to classify hexagonal cells based on land cover, deforestation patterns, and distance from dairy facilities. The results reveal three dominant production systems: Natural Region, Non-Intensive Beef, and Initial Front, with livestock production being prominent. The analysis indicates that there is a correlation between the productive area and deforestation, emphasizing the role of agriculture as a driver of forest loss. Moreover, road networks significantly influence production system spatial distribution, highlighting the importance of infrastructure in land use dynamics. The Shannon diversity index reveals that areas with production systems exhibit greater diversity in land use and land cover classes, reflecting a wider range of modifications. In contrast, natural vegetation areas show lower Shannon values, suggesting that these areas are more intact and are less affected by human activities. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable development policies that will mitigate threats to forest resilience and biodiversity in Pará state. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: this article aims to analyze how contextual knowledge contributes to the production of novelty in the Association of Small Agroforestry Farmers of the Consortium and Densified Economic Reforestation Project and the RECA Project Cooperative, in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. Theoretical approach: in carrying out the research, alternative theoretical approaches were used, exploring a theoretical path in the various categories of knowledge and modernization in agriculture, bringing them closer to the theory of the production of novelties. Method: using a qualitative methodology, we opted for a case study, with data collection involving family farmers and managers of the RECA project cooperative, using semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation. Results: the results showed that the main innovations came from the contextual knowledge of the family farmers who, by deviating from the conventional path, came together, exchanging experiences and developing new production practices using species characteristic of the region. The cooperative has enabled farmers to establish new partnerships; develop new processes and products; increase their competitiveness and access new markets; obtain organic certification, which has resulted in greater appreciation of the product and improved awareness on the part of the farmer with regard to environmental contributions; and produce biofertilizers and organic compost based on the reorganization of internal resources. Conclusion: the study contributes to understanding local dynamics, reinforcing the importance of interaction between local and scientific knowledge. It identifies that the cooperative’s collaborative structure not only favors the exchange of knowledge but also adaptation to local realities, contributing to the discussion in this area. © 2024, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Brazil has 10.2 million hectares of reforestation, which account for 81% of the timber produced in the country. The order Hemiptera contains the main phytophagous species. The study of population surveys allows the analysis of faunal composition, resource availability, as well as potential pests in future plantations, contributing to sustainable pest management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of insects of the order Hemiptera in Eucalyptus spp. plantations in southeastern Pará, Eastern Amazon. Yellow adhesive traps were used to collect entomofauna, with 12 collections in total, (6) during the dry season and (6) during the rainy season. A total of 28 traps were installed in areas with clones of Eucalyptus urophylla, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urograndis, in three municipalities in Pará. The insects collected were analyzed through the faunal indices of abundance,constancy, dominance and frequency, and diversity of Shanon and Pielou. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the families that most influenced the different climatic seasons and in the different clones of Eucalyptus spp. A total of 18.320 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 families. The greatest abundance was observed in the dry season, influencing the seasonality of the families that presented the highest faunal indices. Cicadellidae presented high indices in the three clones, highlighting the clone E. urograndis with the greatest diversity of insects and richness of families, during the dry season, which demonstrates the strong preference of the families for the season and for this species, and indicates a great risk of becoming a potential pest in future commercial plantations, monitoring and preventive actions are recommended to mitigate the impact of these species. © Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil 2025.

AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management (SFM) areas. However, monitoring the forest understory—a critical area for assessing logging impacts—remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rondônia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove habitats play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters’ altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems. © 2025 The author(s).

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems significantly contribute to climate change mitigation through the absorption and storage of carbon. This research evaluates the diversity, carbon stock, and economic valuation of mangrove ecosystems within the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve. Data collection occurred at 11 stations distributed among four primary islands: Kaledupa, Wangi-Wangi, Tomia, and Binongko. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements were utilized to estimate biomass and carbon storage, employing species-specific allometric equations. Economic valuation utilized carbon trading data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX Carbon) as of 3 January 2025, alongside the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Voluntary Market (VM) prices. The mangrove ecosystem of the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10,994 hectares and is in excellent ecological condition. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index values for tree and pole strata demonstrate moderate diversity (1-3), with Kaledupa and Binongko classified as moderate, whereas Wangi-Wangi and Tomia are categorized as low (<1). The evenness score indicates a high classification for tree strata (>0,6), with the exception of Wangi-Wangi, which is classified as medium (0,4-0,6). Wangi-Wangi Island is classified as low for splinter strata (<0,4), whereas Tomia, Kaledupa, and Binongko Islands are classified as medium. The composition of mangrove species differed across islands, with Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Ceriops tagal identified as the most prevalent species and significant contributors to carbon sequestration. The total carbon stock was estimated at 329,82.06 tons, with Kaledupa Island exhibiting the highest stock at 317,226.51 tons, while Binongko Island recorded the lowest at 2,053.8 tons. The economic valuation of carbon storage indicates significant potential: IDR 18,763,377,420 or USD 1,159,307 (IDX Carbon), IDR 266,390,582,055 or USD 16,459,103 (SCC), and IDR 43,155,274,293 or USD 2,666,375 (VM), underscoring the financial importance of mangrove conservation. This signifies a potential for revenue generation in the Wakatobi region, offering a hopeful prospect for the future. This study highlights the ecological and economic significance of mangroves and establishes a basis for sustainable conservation and management strategies aimed at improving the resilience of the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve. © 2025, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Biochar is increasingly being assessed as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by tropical soils, as it can help mitigate land degradation, replenish nutrients, and enhance soil structure, increasing fertility and promoting the development of crops. This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 °C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected—in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.

AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role of biodiversity management strategies aimed at developing sustainable agricultural and food systems. Riparian vegetation management strategies are essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems, particularly through the selecting suitable plant species. The objective of this study is to analyze the riparian vegetation of the Kampar River basin and clustering species. The study was conducted in the riparian area of the Kampar River, Indonesia, across eight stations. The methods included phytosociological relevés, cluster analysis, and ecophysiological indicator analysis. The study identified 38 dominant plant species in the riparian area of the Kampar River Basin on podsolic soils, grouped into five main clusters. On peatlands, 26 plant species were identified, organized into three clusters based on similarities in chemical and physical properties of soil and mesoclimatic factors. The identification and use of local plants that are well-adapted can be used to develop riparian vegetation management strategies and support sustainable agriculture in the riparian zone of the Kampar River Basin. © 2025, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - For decades, tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses, mainly oil palm plantations which now cover one-fourth of the degraded peatland area. Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 emissions, though CH4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 yr−1. This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Indigenous territories in Brazil have existed since the pre-European discovery of the continent. Yet, many of them remain without formal recognition by the state. While numerous studies discuss the social implications of indigenous land (IL) designation, limited empirical evidence exists regarding its role in forest conservation. To address this gap, the present study employs a quasi-experimental design and causal-inference methods to estimate the effects of formal IL designation on deforestation across Brazil and its biomes, from 1986 to 2021. Estimates indicate an average impact of −0.05% on deforestation due to the formal designation of ILs nationwide, with variations ranging from −0.21% to 0.04% across different evaluation periods and biomes. Notably, designated ILs in the Cerrado biome had the highest avoided deforestation impacts (−0.12%, on average). No evidence of deforestation leakage was observed. The findings from this study suggest that while the promotion of formal IL designation can lead to consistent reductions in deforestation, the magnitude of its effect is relatively small to be promoted on the sole basis of an effective strategy to mitigate tropical deforestation and climate change. Nevertheless, the potential positive socioeconomic impacts of formal IL designation on indigenous peoples cannot be undermined. © 2024 The Author

AB  - Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For countries’ emission-reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement to be effective, baseline emission/removals levels and reporting must be as transparent and accurate as possible. For Indonesia, which holds among the largest area of tropical peatlands and mangrove forest in the world, it is particularly important for these high-carbon ecosystems to produce high-accuracy greenhouse gas inventory and to improve national forest reference emissions level/forest reference level. Here, we highlight the opportunity for refining greenhouse gas emission factors (EF) of peatlands and mangroves and describe scientific challenges to support climate policy processes in Indonesia, where 55 to 59% of national emission reduction targets by 2030 depend on mitigation in Forestry and Other Land Use. Based on the stock-difference and flux change approaches, we examine higher-tier EF for drained and rewetted peatland, peatland fires, mangrove conversions, and mangrove on peatland to improve future greenhouse gas flux reporting in Indonesia. We suggest that these refinements will be essential to support Indonesia in achieving Forest and Other Land Use net sink by 2030 and net zero emissions targets by 2060 or earlier.

AB  - In 2020, the world's largest continuous stretch of wetlands, the Pantanal in South America, recorded its most catastrophic fire season of the last two decades, resulting in severe economic, ecological and health consequences. Regional environmental institutions and communities are taking measures to protect their unique ecosystem, as is the case of the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural (RPPN) Sesc Pantanal, a national protected area. The reserve was severely affected by the 2020 wildfires and is now en route to recover and intensify prevention strategies. Here, we employ a state-of-the-art satellite-derived burned area dataset and a global climate reanalysis product to map and assess the incidence and vulnerability of this reserve to its most concerning disturbance: wildfires. We validated the remote-sensed burned area product and found that the product successfully maps the years with higher fire activity. Then, we studied historical occurrences of burned areas within the reserve. The results show large burned areas are uncommon, and highlight the year 2020 as an outlier, when around 65 % of the reserve was burned. Climate trends over the last four decades show increasing temperatures and wind speed, and decreasing relative humidity and precipitation. Fire weather is thus steadily rising, bearing favourable conditions for fire activity over the most critical months of the year. This study provides useful information for fire management decisions within the largest privately held natural reserve in Brazil, and further allows the assessment of the applicability and limitations of large-scale and state-of-the-art products to inform decision-making within protected areas. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change, emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales. This is essential for effective carbon management, which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation. However, reliable sample-based estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations, which are lacking for the rainforests of the Atlantic Forest Domain (AFD). In this study, we fitted biomass equations for the three main AFD forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their above-ground biomass (AGB) in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Using non-destructive methods, we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest, semideciduous forest, and restinga forest in the state. The biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with tree-level data from 185 plots obtained in the National Forest Inventory conducted in Rio de Janeiro. Our locally developed allometric equations estimated the state’s biomass stocks at 70.8 ± 5.4 Mg ha−1 and carbon stocks at 35.4 ± 2.7 Mg ha−1. Notably, our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature, which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks. These findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest, especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market, which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Belitung Island, situated in the Southeast Asian tin belt, experiences substantial transformations in land use and land cover (LULC) driven by mining activities, impacting both local economic growth and the ecosystem. This study aims to elucidate the dynamic LULC changes on Belitung Island and evaluate deforestation trends. LULC data spanning from 1990 to 2020 were acquired from The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), employing supervised classification of satellite imageries. The dataset demonstrated an overall accuracy ranging from 0.79 to 0.92 and was reclassified into six types based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC's classes, encompassing forest, cropland, grassland, other land, settlements, and wetlands. Our research unveiled a notable reduction of over 25 % in forest cover within the past 30 years. Notably, 2020 exhibited instances of reforestation, which subsequently transformed into cropland (0.57 %), grassland (0.32 %), and other lands (0.39 %). Belitung Island grapples with challenges related to sustainable development, environmental conservation, and food security. Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) emerges as a potential strategy to address some of the socioeconomic and ecological issues. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Surakarta is a city in Central Java, Indonesia that has the potential to be affected by any type of disaster. This study aims to identify hazards that may cause disasters in the city; to measure the level of damage produced by the disasters; and to provide disaster mitigation strategies for the city over the 2023-2027 period of time. To achieve these aims, this study uses the risk matrix method to determine the level of risk imposed by each of the potential disasters and implements the house of risk (HoR) phase 2 to formulate disaster mitigation strategies. The study reveals that there are 7 potential disasters taking place in the city during the time period of 2023-2027. The use of HoR phase 2 results in 10 mitigation strategies, namely "Carrying out disaster outreach and education"; "Collaborating with other parties in disaster management", "Strengthening the legal framework for disaster management", "Mapping disaster-prone areas", "Providing early warning of disasters to communities", "Forming disaster-resilient villages", "Cleaning and developing water drainage channel", "Controlling illegal settlements", "Adding water catchment areas"; and "Conducting reforestation". © 2024 EDP Sciences.

AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting element for the productivity of mangroves, which in turn are important ecosystems in regulating nutrients cycle and climate change by sequestering carbon (C). Despite this, there is an intense process of degradation in these environments. In addition to providing socio-environmental services, mangrove replanting can also alter the dynamics of nutrients in soils. Therefore, this study aims to understand the changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions after a mangrove restoration. Soil samples from an unvegetated area (NV), a mature mangrove (R) and 7 and 9 year old replanted mangroves at SE-Brazil (APA Guapi-mirim, Rio de Janeiro state) were collected and analyzed to characterize the redox conditions (Eh), pH, and iron (Fe) fractionation, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and P fractionation (exchangeable P; P associated with reducible Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides; associated with Al silicates and hydroxides; associated with humic acids; associated with Ca and Mg; associated with humin). The results indicate an increase in TOC as the age of the mangrove restoration increases (from 8.6 to 17.9%). The pH values were significantly lower, reaching very acidic values, associated with an increase in Eh. Both parameters also showed strong seasonal variation, with a drop in Eh during the wet period (from 165% to −46%) and an increase in pH in the same period (from 6.0 to 6.7). Regarding P fractionation, the main P pool was organic P forms, which showed the highest concentrations in all studied sites. Unvegetated areas showed higher organic P forms (NV: 108.8 μg g−1) than vegetated areas (M7: 55.7 μg g−1, M9: 83.6 μg g−1, R: 87.3 μg g−1). Vegetated sites also showed lower levels of the PEx, PFeMn and Papatite fractions (total forest mean: 2.4 μg g−1, 5.8 μg g−1, 3.0 μg g−1, respectively). Besides no clear trend on P fractionation through seasons and forest age, pseudo-total P increased following the forest recovery (e.g. M7<M9<R), showing the re-establishment of temporary nutrient retention capacity with the replanting of the mangrove. Mangroves replanting affected P dynamics, promoting an accumulation of P in soils, also indicated the reestablishment of ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations influenced the ability of P retention and release for adjacent areas. Our findings indicate that mangrove restoration affected the key parameters (pH, Eh, TOC) which controlled soil processes (redox reactions, organic matter degradation), impacting the cycles of Fe, C, and P cycles. Therefore, crucial soil ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient regulation and C storage) were improved by replanting mangroves. However, seasonal trends on nutrient dynamics still need further studies to better understand soil processes, especially in replanting environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forests play a pivotal role in environmental conservation, necessitating effective management strategies to ensure sustainability. This research aims to evaluate the potential implementation of forest endowments (waqf) through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The study employs two methodologies: a comprehensive SWOT analysis to examine internal and external factors and the Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) and External Factor Evaluation (EFE) methods within the SWOT matrix framework. Data were gathered via questionnaires distributed to representatives of environmental care communities. The findings indicate that internal factors, particularly potential strengths, support the implementation of waqf forests. Internal and external factors contribute to these strengths, enhancing the potential for successful implementation. Weaknesses can be mitigated by leveraging existing strengths. External factors are categorized into opportunities, which can promote the development of waqf forest strategies, and threats, which necessitate strategic interventions. The analysis reveals that the strength factor scores higher overall than the weakness factor, suggesting a promising outlook for successful implementation. These research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of waqf forest implementation by thoroughly analyzing the relevant internal and external factors. The identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats provide valuable guidance for stakeholders aiming to optimize the use of waqf forests for environmental conservation and sustainable management. © 2024 The authors.

AB  - Purpose: Using treated swine wastewater (TWW) for crop irrigation, especially in semi-arid regions, can help mitigate water demand–supply imbalances and prevent environmental degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of treated swine wastewater (TWW) application on soil fertility attributes and to establish management zones (MZs) for its optimal use. Methods: Soil samples were collected using a regular grid of 110 points (10 × 10 m) across 1.25 ha, where annual applications of 500 m3 ha–1 year–1 of swine TWW were carried out for two years. The soil attributes evaluated included pH, soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potential acidity (H + Al), sum of bases (SB), and potential cation exchange capacity (CEC). Results: The application of TWW significantly reduced soil pH and P levels while increasing SOM, K, Ca, SB, and CEC. However, the spatial variability maps of the soil attributes indicated low uniformity in the swine TWW application, demonstrating improper management of the irrigation system. Additionally, heterogeneity was observed for K, Na, Mg, and H + Al between the MZs. Conclusion: The study identified two MZs, which served as a foundation for guiding the application of swine TWW and effectively managing soil fertility in the area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Agricultural Machinery 2024.

AB  - Agroforestry is often seen as a sustainable land-use system for agricultural production providing ecosystem services. Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the anthropogenic pressures of expansion areas for livestock and agricultural production in the Brazilian Cerrado, it is of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in this region. Thus, we investigated LULC changes in two sub-basins of the Tocantins-Araguaia River basin from 1997 to 2015 and consequently projected future changes for the timespan between 2030 and 2050. The Formoso sub-basin experienced significant expansion of agricultural and pasture areas, whereas the Sono sub-basin limited farmland expansion (more stable native vegetation) due to substantial protected areas, trends that were also observed for future projections (2030 and 2050). Pastureland in the Formoso sub-basin increased by 5.8%, while the Sono sub-basin saw significant gains in cultivated land, according to change detection analyses during the 1997–2015 period. High stability probabilities of no change (> 70%) for grassland areas in the Sono River sub-basin and pasturelands in the Formoso River sub-basin were computed. The CA–Markov model demonstrated a high consistency level with actual LULC classes for both sub-basins, as indicated by an overall Kappa coefficient above 0.8. Future projections for 2030 and 2050 show a substantial expansion of agriculture and pasture in both sub-basins, driven by specific factors such as soil organic carbon stocks, distance from rural settlements, and proximity to rivers. Short- and mid-term simulations indicate substantial expansion of agriculture and pasture in both basins, with potential adverse impacts on water erosion. Consequently, developing policies for soil management and sustainable land use planning is essential for agroecosystem sustainability, promoting a balanced approach to economic development while addressing climate change and anthropogenic challenges. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Fish farming is increasingly important globally and nationally, playing a crucial role in fish production for human consumption. Monitoring microbiological and chemical contaminants from water discharge is essential to mitigate the risk of contaminating water and fish for human consumption. This study analyzes the physicochemical and E. coli parameters of water and tambacu fish muscles (Colossoma macropomum × Piaractus mesopotamicus) in Western Maranhão, Brazil. It also includes a qualitative characterization of zooplankton in the ponds. Samples were collected from tambacu ponds in a dam system fed by natural watercourses from the Tocantins River tributaries, located at the connection of the Brazilian savanna and Amazon biomes. The physicochemical and E. coli parameters of water did not meet national standards. The zooplankton community included Rotifera, Cladocera, Copepoda, and Protozoa representatives, with no prior studies on zooplankton in the region, making these findings unprecedented. The biological quality of freshwater is crucial in fish farming, as poor quality can lead to decreased productivity and fish mortality, raising significant food safety concerns. The water quality studied is related to the potential influence of untreated wastewater as a source of contamination, leaving the studied region still far from safe water reuse practices. The findings on chemical and E. coli contamination of fish farming waters concern human health and emphasize the need for appropriate regulations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - No-till system (NTS) is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity. Therefore, employing NTS results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas. This study aims to evaluate the causal effect between NTS adoption and land use decisions in Brazil, with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas. The discussion on the effects of NTS use over agricultural practices gains relevance in Brazil, given the country's strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity. We conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching, which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly. Our statistical results show that the adoption of NTS had a positive effect on the natural (0.338; p-value < 0.05) and cultivated agricultural (0.214; p-value < 0.05) areas of the treated municipalities. The evidence from this case study indicates that NTS allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands, preserving natural areas, while corroborating Borlaug's approach and further reinforcing the use of NTS as a sustainable soil management practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates the spatial urban growth patterns of cities along the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia border, a region of significant economic importance characterized by cross-border trade. This activity has led to rapid but unplanned urban growth. The objective is to quantify the spatial expansion of Congolese cities (Kipushi, Kasumbalesa, Mokambo, and Sakania) bordering Zambia and to evaluate associated landscape changes. The methodology of this study includes the supervised classification of Landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2023. This classification was validated using field data. Subsequently, landscape metrics such as class area, patch number, Shannon diversity index, disturbance index, urban expansion intensity index, largest patch index, and mean Euclidean distance were calculated for each city and each date. The results reveal substantial landscape transformations in the border cities between 1990 and 2023. These changes are primarily driven by rapid urban expansion, particularly pronounced in Kasumbalesa. Between 1990 and 2023, forest cover declined from 70% to less than 15% in Kipushi, from 80% to 10% in Kasumbalesa, from 90% to 30% in Mokambo, and from 80% to 15% in Sakania. This forest cover loss is accompanied by an increase in landscape element diversity, as indicated by the Shannon diversity index, except in Kipushi, suggesting a transition towards more heterogeneous landscapes. In these border cities, landscape dynamics are also characterized by the expansion of agriculture and savannas, highlighted by an increase in the disturbance index. Analysis of spatial pattern changes shows that built-up areas, agriculture, and savannas exhibit trends of patch creation or aggregation, whereas forests are undergoing processes of dissection and patch attrition. Congolese cities bordering Zambia are undergoing substantial spatial changes propelled by intricate interactions between economic, demographic, and infrastructural factors. Our results underscore the need for sustainable development strategies to address urban sprawl through smart growth policies and mixed-use developments, mitigate deforestation via stricter land use regulations and reforestation projects, and enhance cross-border cooperation through joint environmental management and collaborative research initiatives. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered a hotspot for biodiversity conservation. However, in recent decades, the intensification of human activities, directly influencing changes in use and coverage, has caused severe environmental problems. Thus, this study proposed a dynamic environmental zoning model for the Pântano River watershed (PRW) based on the CA-Markov model and Multicriteria Analysis. The methodological procedures were based on predictive modeling of land use and land cover, analysis of environmental fragility, and estimation of soil losses and sediment delivery rate from the InVEST model for the years 1984, 2007, 2013, 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results showed that over the time analyzed and projected, in the category of Legal Restrictions Zone, there was a slight decrease in the extension of Permanent Preservation Areas, while the Natural Vegetation cover increased considerably, indicating possible changes in the environmental patterns of the region. The areas classified as Plains maintained minimal variations throughout the period studied. With regard to the Rural Productive Zone, there was a notable increase in areas with Low Restriction, suggesting an expansion of less restrictive agricultural and land use activities. On the other hand, the areas with Medium and High Restrictions showed decreasing trends, signaling possible improvements in environmental management and conservation of natural resources. Also noteworthy is the significant reduction in areas classified as High Restriction, associated with the high rate of soil loss. This trend is particularly relevant as it indicates practical efforts to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and promote sustainable soil management practices. Finally, the areas designated as Special Protection Zones, including Incongruities and Reservoirs, remained stable throughout the period analyzed, demonstrating the importance of preserving these areas to conservation of biodiversity and water resources. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study contribute to guiding public policies and environmental management practices in the PRW region. The observed trends indicate a positive evolution towards the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, underscoring the importance of continuous measures to ensure the health and resilience of local ecosystems. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Sustainable soil management is indispensable for achieving the UN Sustainable Development goals and soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation has gained importance in recent years, yet there are few examples of projects carried out to this purpose, and protocols that facilitate this task. Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso. The OMI showed differences between the three VE scores ranging from 4.7 to 6.7 and from 3.1 to 5.1 in the 0–0.1 m and 0.1–0.2 m depths, respectively. Relationships between the VE score and SOC, OMI, Sand, Silt and Clay plus Silt were only found for the 39 cases of VE “moderate” score in Pampas soils, whereas for the 39 cases of “good” scores no significant relations were encountered. These soils had high SOC and OMI, indicating that they are healthy soils, near saturation level, with low C sequestration potential. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The idle swamp land of the former mega rice project in Indonesia has the potential for development of paddy field as a response to the global food crisis. Mapping of pyrite (FeS2) in swamp land as the key driver of soil degradation and poor water quality has not been made to establish a strategy for sustainable paddy field practices. The objective of the study was to assess the spatial distribution of pyrite (FeS2) through detailed mapping, and to evaluate soil and water properties associated with the adverse effects of pyrite. Detailed conventional pyrite mapping with a grid system at 1:10,000 scale, covering a large area of 26,588 ha, had been made. A comprehensive analysis of soil chemical, physical and mineralogical properties, pyrite content, and water properties was conducted. The detailed pyrite mapping showed that spatial distribution of pyrite was delineated into six depth classes, in the order of decreasing extent: P3-moderately deep (>50–75 cm) > P4-deep (>75–100 cm) ≫ P5-very deep (>100–150 cm) > P2-shallow (>25–50 cm) > P6-exceptionally deep (>150 cm) > P1-very shallow (0–25 cm). These pyrite classes allow zonation management strategy of soils and water table into different depths to avoid pyrite oxidation and its harmful effect. Soils have limited easily weathered minerals (<16 %), implying low inherited soil nutrients. In the topsoils, chemical properties exhibited extreme acidity (pH 3.8–4.2), imbalanced cations with excess Mg, low in K and P and Zn, Cu, and Mn micronutrients. The dynamic changes of water properties in network canals showed a drop in pH from 6.0 at the inlet and primary canal to 2.9 and 3.5 in the canal network (secondary > tertiary > quaternary > pyrite collector), as well as the increased Al and SO4 ions suggests the decrease in quality throughout the canal network. We propose the management strategy for the sustainable establishment of paddy field in pyritic swamp areas including: (i) performing detailed mapping of pyrite classes to guide depth-based pyrite zonation to control water table, (ii) implementing controlled drainage water flow from inlet to various canal networks corresponds to pyrite depth zonation, (iii) applying lime with Ca-rich materials but not dolomite (containing Mg) to improve cation balance, reduce acidity, increase soil pH and suppress ion toxicity, (iv) utilizing adaptive/tolerant rice cultivars to acidity, and (v) application of NPK fertilizer to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. These strategies can be implemented to ensure the sustainability of paddy fields and avoid soil degradation in swamp land. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and Goal 13 (Climate Action), underscore the interconnectedness between air quality and climate change. Escalating levels of air pollution in both urban and rural regions of Indonesia necessitate a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to air quality degradation. This study employs a generalized linear modeling approach, specifically focusing on ordinal logistic regression, to explore the determinants influencing the Air Quality Index (AQI) across 34 provinces in Indonesia. Key predictors, including motor vehicle density, population density, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and forest cover, are analyzed to assess their impact on air quality levels. The findings indicate that the number of motor vehicles and the extent of forest cover are significant predictors of air quality. Elevated motor vehicle density is shown to deteriorate the AQI, while larger forest cover areas are associated with improvements in air quality. These results emphasize the importance of targeted environmental interventions, particularly those aimed at reducing vehicle emissions and preserving forest ecosystems. The study highlights the need for the development and enforcement of policies that promote sustainable urban mobility and forest conservation to mitigate air pollution. By providing a comprehensive statistical framework through ordinal logistic regression, this research offers actionable insights for policymakers. The findings can guide the formulation of effective environmental management strategies, supporting efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives. Moreover, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting rigorous statistical models to address complex environmental challenges, contributing to the broader discourse on sustainability and climate action. © 2024 by the author(s).

AB  - Climate change is characterized by shifting climate patterns that result in erratic weather phenomena. One of the major consequences of climate change is the reduction in biodiversity and the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily carbon. Agroforestry systems (AF) have emerged as a potential solution to mitigate these effects by conversing biodiversity and enhancing carbon stocks. This study aims to analyze the species composition and structure of tree stands and estimate the carbon stock in the AF of the community forest (HKm). The methods used employed included vegetation analysis, stand structure measurement using the Spatially Explicit Individual-based Forest Simulator (SExI-FS), and carbon stock estimation using allometric equations and destructive approaches for seedlings and understory levels. A total of 25 plots, each measuring 20×20 m, were used for data collection. The results show that the species composition in HKm Wana Lestari consists of 63 plant species from 40 families. The highest importance value index (IVI) was recorded for durian (Durio zibethinus Murray) at the pole growth level (90.34%), while coffee (Coffea robusta L.Linden) emerged as the dominant species within the agroforestry system. The diversity index (H') ranged from 0.40 to 2.29, indicating a medium category of diversity. The stand structure did not follow the expected "J" curve pattern. The total biomass and carbon stock across all growth levels were found to be 228.35 and 107.22 tons/ha, respectively. In conclusion, the agroforestry system in HKm Wana Lestari demonstrates notable species diversity and carbon storage potential, although its stand structure deviates from the ideal "J" curve, suggesting opportunities for further forest management improvements. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Indonesia is the global coral reef restoration leader by number of projects, yet these remain diverse and disparate. This study reviews the status of Indonesian coral reef restoration within a framework of international common best practice (CBP) that incorporates internationally-recognised Standards for Ecological Restoration (SER). This framework is used to formulate recommendations for a formal network of reef restoration practitioners with the purview to develop and implement a national restoration roadmap. Forty-five projects were surveyed to determine how projects have been planned and implemented. This was compared with recommendations from CBP. There is particular scope to increase quantitative data collection, reinforce community involvement, improve ecological data collection, and standardise monitoring protocols. While 84% of projects reported quantifiable goals, 64% did not quantify goals during planning and 61% did not incorporate climate-smart design features. Quantitative reef monitoring surveys were absent in 22% of projects. The majority of projects did not quantify important ecological metrics like coral community composition/diversity (96%), coral health/bleaching (89%), benthic community (62%), and coral survival (62%). Indonesia has the capacity, regulations, and networks to position itself as a reef restoration driver in the Coral Triangle region; this will require increased coordination, alignment, and quantification of restoration. A structured, collaborative, and iterative national network of various stakeholders would facilitate the development of a national restoration roadmap based on adaptive management strategies. This would aid in standardising project planning, monitoring, and reporting. Efforts should include an increased focus on climate change adaptation goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Salinization is a severe threat to agriculture and the environment in many areas, and the same in Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, Northwestern China. Microorganisms have an important influence on regulating the biochemical cycles of ecosystems; however, systematic research exploring microbial diversity and interactions with saline-soil ecosystems’ environmental variables remains scarce. Thus, 16 S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was performed in this paper to characterize microbial diversity under different levels of salinized soils: non-salinized (NS, 2.25 g/L), moderately salinized (MS, 6.14 g/L) and highly salinized (HS, 9.82 g/L). The alpha diversity results showed that the HS soil was significantly different from the NS and MS soils. An analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and a principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that NS and MS clustered closely while HS separated from the other two. Significant differences in microbial composition were observed at the taxonomic level. Proteobacteria (42.29–79.23 %) were the most abundant phyla in the studied soils. Gammaproteobacteria (52.49 and 66.61 %) had higher abundance in the MS and HS soils at the class level; Methylophaga and Pseudomonas were the predominant bacteria in the HS soil; and Azotobacter and Methylobacillus were abundant in the MS soil. Most genera belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were detected via a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis, which indicated that microbes with the ability to degrade organic matter and accomplish nutrient cycling can be well-adapted to salt conditions. Further analyses (redundancy analysis and Mantel test) showed that the microbial communities were mainly related to the soil salinity, electrical conductivity (EC1:5), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N). Overall, the findings of the study can provide insights for better understanding the dominant indigenous microbes and their roles in biochemical cycles in different saline soils in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, China. The researches related to microbial community under typical poplar species should further clarify the mechanism of plant-microbial interaction and benefit for microbial utilization in salt soil remediation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Indonesia, renowned as the most mangrove-rich nation, has committed to extensive mangrove restoration policies, but the effects of these policies have yet to be systematically evaluated. Our study conducts a comprehensive network analysis to investigate the synergies between mangrove restoration policy and global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievements by exploring their interactions. This investigation follows the ‘product space’ method in economics and creates the ‘Mangrove-SDG space’ to assess each metric pair's co-occurrence and comparative advantages with validated stability. Our analysis unveils a tripartite structure, encompassing socio-economic and environmental clusters, each significantly contributing to global sustainability and a distinctive mangrove cluster tied to land attributes. At the Goal level, mangrove loss showcases robust synergies with SDGs 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate Change), and mangrove metrics such as tropical storm frequency and mangrove change, indicating strong interdependences between mangrove forests and SDGs. The result indicates that improved performance of climate change and responsible consumption can greatly enhance mangrove forests' performance in alleviating mangrove loss and reducing tropical storms. Moreover, our analysis underscores the central roles played by ‘bridge’ Goals. Indicator-level space details how they warrant prioritization because of their cascade synergistic enhancements across widely interconnected indicators, triggering systematic positive improvements. Turning to Indonesia, we advocate a strategic shift from solely expanding mangrove extent to focusing on four critical policy priorities: effective nitrogen management, enhancing Ramsar site efficiency, optimizing logistic performance, and addressing urban population conditions. These priorities are pivotal to seeking complementarities between Indonesia's international sustainability commitment and fostering mangrove restoration success. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Efforts to enhance carbon stocks and boost carbon absorption potential are essential for climate change mitigation. Peatland ecosystems, known for their high organic content, are particularly vulnerable to environmental management. The study aimed to examine the alterations in land use and land cover that occurred between 1998 and 2022, spanning a 24-year duration. Additionally, it sought to assess the associated variations in carbon stocks within the designated Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area. The area under investigation encompasses a peatland ecosystem that has experienced substantial changes in land cover and land use. This study investigated the fluctuations in carbon stock caused by these alterations and provides valuable perspectives on the potential of agroforestry systems to promote a wider range of land uses. Additionally, it highlights their role in ecosystem restoration initiatives and the better management of forest peatland regions. METHODS: A spatial analysis was conducted on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images by using shapefile data stored within the Google Earth Engine platform. Data analysis was carried out using Classification and Regression Tree, a decision tree algorithm used in machine learning for guided classification. Furthermore, purposive sampling was utilized to gather socioeconomic data, followed by the implementation of a benefit-cost analysis. FINDINGS: The results revealed significant changes in the land cover within the Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area over a 24-year period, with forested areas and open areas decreasing by 23.15 hectares per year and 16.94 hectares per year respectively, and oil palm plantation areas expanding by 40.10 hectares per year. From 1998 to 2022, there has been a consistent annual decline in carbon stocks, resulting in a reduction of 1, 933.11 tons of carbon per year. The changes in land use and cover are closely linked to this decline. In an effort to increase plant species diversity in the area and support the gradual transition away from monoculture, a participatory agroforestry scheme was implemented by intercropping Coffea liberica and Shorea balangeran between oil palm rows in a 2-hectare oil palm plantation block within the agroforestry demonstration plot. According to measurements taken at breast height, the aboveground biomass of these species was measured, leading to projected estimates of carbon stocks in Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area reaching 19, 455 tonnes of carbon by the year 2030, with Coffea liberica contributing 4, 148 tonnes carbon and Shorea balangeran contributing 15, 307 tonnes carbon. CONCLUSION: The study area experienced a substantial reduction in forest cover, whereas the extent of oil palm areas expanded significantly. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures to strengthen the governance of specific-purpose forest areas through community empowerment and the establishment of demonstration plots to promote agroforestry development. The results of this study provide insights for long-term forest rehabilitation strategies aimed at fostering sustainable forest management that yields environmental and socio-economic benefits in the long run. © 2024 The author(s).

AB  - Coal mining is known for its contributions to climate change, but its impacts on the environment and human lives near mine sites are less widely recognised. This study integrates remote sensing, GIS, stakeholder interviews and extensive review of provincial data and documents to identify patterns of infringement, risk and impact driven by coal mining expansion across East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Specifically, we map and analyse patterns of mining concessions, land clearing, water cover, human settlement, and safety risks, and link them with mining governance and regulatory infractions related to coal mining permits. We show that excessive, improper permit granting and insufficient monitoring and oversight have led to deforestation, widespread overlaps of concessions with settlements, extensive boundary and regulatory violations, lacking reclamation, and numerous deaths. As the world’s largest thermal coal exporter, Indonesia’s elevated coal infringements, risks, and impacts translate to supply chain, sustainability, and human rights concerns for global coal markets. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Ecological intensification (EI) of agriculture aims to optimize soil conservation, crop diversity and nutrient management. Despite growing interest in EI, its impact on soil properties, compared with conventional farming practice (FP), remains poorly understood as a result of limited field evidence. This study, conducted over eight seasons in southern Brazil as part of the ‘Global Maize Project’ of the International Plant Nutrition Institute, evaluated EI compared with FP, and FP with silage (FPS) using a split-plot design. Four nitrogen application rates (0, 70, 140 and 210 kg ha−1) were applied to subplots with four replicates. Soil properties were measured to a depth of 1 m. The trial systems consisted of a maize–soybean rotation under no-till during summer and cover crops and fertilizer application during winter. In the FP system, black oats and wheat were cultivated, while FPS utilized white oats and ryegrass. In the EI system, peas (without N application) and wheat were cultivated. In the 4-years preceding the trial, the area was cultivated in a no-till system with maize–soybean during summer and black oat–wheat in winter. Our results reveal distinct differences in soil properties among the systems, with FPS demonstrating greater soil acidity (pH of 4.4 at 0–5 cm) caused by higher N application than FP and EI systems. The lower soil pH altered soil nutrient dynamics, with decreased available Ca, Mg and K and increased Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. Furthermore, nutrient availability varied, with EI having more inorganic N and DON at 0–40 cm compared with FP, but less in deeper soil (40–100 cm). Notably, EI system had more soil carbon (175 Mg ha−1) compared with FP (161 Mg ha−1), a relative annual increase of 1.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 over 8 years. These findings underscore the potential of EI to promote soil carbon, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and soil health improvement. © 2024 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Tropical dry forests are the most threatened of all the major tropical forest types and less than 25% of TDF currently remain worldwide. They are located mostly in South America. Parameters such as habitat loss, fragmentation and loss of connectivity have been identified as the main threats to biodiversity. This research aims to discover the forests changes, the evolution of connectivity and fragmentation of the South American tropical dry forest between 1992 and 2020. Land uses layers provided by the Copernicus program were employed, and land uses change, fragmentation and structural connectivity were analyzed in GIS systems. To calculate the functional connectivity, the Graphab software was used. The results showed a loss of forest surface, where fragmentation increased and a loss of functional connectivity between 25% and 49% occurs depended on the parameter analysed. On the other hand, some areas were recovered. Brazil is the country that recovered the most forest area and Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia those that lost the most area. Only 31% of the area was not altered between 1992 and 2020. Human activities such as deforestation, agriculture expansion, and urbanization have led these forests to become increasingly fragmented and worse connected impacting on both ecological and socio-economic aspects. Supranational measures must be taken to mitigate the negative impacts of fragmentation and the loss of connectivity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Understanding how tropical forests respond to abiotic environmental changes is critical for preserving biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and maintaining ecosystem services in the coming century. To evaluate the relative roles of the abiotic environment and human disturbance on Central African tree community composition, we employ tree inventory data, remotely sensed climatic data, and soil nutrient data collected from 30 1-ha plots distributed across a large-scale observational experiment in forests that had been differently impacted by logging and hunting in northern Republic of Congo. We show that the composition of Afrotropical plant communities at this scale responds to human disturbance more than to climate, with particular sensitivities to hunting and distance to the nearest village (a proxy for other human activities, including tree-cutting and gathering). These findings contrast neotropical predictions, highlighting the unique ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic history of Afrotropical forests. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The logging intensity often does not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the forest volume of commercial native species in the Brazilian Amazon. This study aims to evaluate the spatio-temporal heterogeneity distribution by assessing logging intensity and its effects on the volumetric stock and abundance of commercial species, with a focus on sustainable management practices. This study was conducted in the Saracá-Taquera National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Forest inventory data, elevation, and PlanetScope satellite images were integrated into a geographic information system. The information was aggregated into regular 1-hectare cells for the times before, during, and after logging (t0, t1, and t2). The unsupervised classification algorithm k-means with four clusters was used to analyze heterogeneity. Before logging, areas with higher commercial volumes were distant from water bodies, while areas with lower elevation had lower wood stocks. Logging intensity was generally low, concentrating on a few trees per hectare. Logging in the study area revealed a heterogeneous spatial distribution by intensifying in areas with the highest wood stocks. These results suggest that, in addition to the recommended logging intensity according to legislation, forest heterogeneity should be considered by the manager, promoting adaptive strategies to ensure the conservation of forest resources. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Brazil, a crucial player in global climate change mitigation, faces challenges in reducing its carbon emissions, of which nearly half are from land use changes. Despite potential reductions that can be achieved through halting deforestation and fostering forest restoration, setbacks in environmental governance have heightened emissions. This article assesses challenges and proposes solutions for conserving and restoring Brazilian biomes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement by 2030. Notably, net carbon emissions from land-use change and forestry increased twofold from 2017 to 2022 due to deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado. Native vegetation clearing peaked at 2.8 Mha in 2022, the largest area since 2008. The deficit of native vegetation within Legal Reserves and Permanent Protection Areas must be addressed through restoration. Achieving SDGs by 2030 demands urgent action against illegal deforestation, reinforced legislation for secondary forest protection, large-scale restoration programs, and economic incentives for forest conservation through payment for ecosystem services to rural landowners. © 2024 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Agricultural land in Indonesia is decreasing due to its conversion for various non-agricultural interests, which are economically more profitable. The remaining land available for agricultural activities is a suboptimal wetland. The reduction in cultivable areas has led to the evaluation of alternative crops in suboptimal land conditions. Chaya (Cnidoscolus aconitifolius) is a fast-growing perennial plant, its leaves are edible and rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. However, the chaya plant has not been intensively tested for its adaptation to shallow groundwater tables in tropical lowlands. This study aimed to assess chaya’s adaptability to shallow groundwater table conditions and the benefits of using organic mulch. This research consisted of two separate parts, one part was related to organic mulch benefits (planting media without watering, with organic mulch but not watered, and with organic mulch and watering), while the other one was related to shallow groundwater table tolerance. The study followed a randomized complete block design consisting of three replications. Results showed that chaya plants negatively responded to the shallow groundwater table conditions. Growth retardation due to shallow groundwater levels is reflected in the averages of leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, canopy diameter, and canopy area; fresh and dry weight of stem, petiole, and leaf blade; development of roots; SPAD value at 7 weeks after transplanting and it was based on visual appearance. However, despite the increase in substrate humidity due to the application of organic mulch, the effects were not significant on most of the measured morphological traits. In conclusion, chaya plants are not able to adapt to shallow groundwater levels and do not require organic mulch on the soil surface. © 2024 Fundacion Miguel Lillo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land desertification poses a significant challenge in the Brazilian semiarid region, encompassing a substantial portion of the country. Within this region, the detrimental effects of human activities, particularly unsuitable anthropic actions, have resulted in diminished vegetation cover and an accelerated rate of soil erosion. Notably, practices such as overgrazing and the conversion of native forests into pasturelands have played a pivotal role in exacerbating the process of land desertification. Ultimately, land desertification results in significant losses of soil organic matter and microbial diversity. To address this pressing issue and contribute to the existing literature, various land restoration practices, such as grazing exclusion, cover crops, and terracing, have been implemented in the Brazilian semiarid. These practices have shown promising results in terms of enhancing soil fertility and restoring microbial properties. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in improving soil microbial properties in the Brazilian semiarid region remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent advances in molecular techniques have improved our understanding of microbial communities in lands undergoing desertification and restoration. In this review, we focus on assessing the effectiveness of these restoration practices in revitalizing soil microbial properties, with a particular emphasis on the soil microbiome and its functions. Through a critical assessment of the impact of these practices on soil microbial properties, our research aims to provide valuable insights that can help mitigate the adverse effects of desertification and promote sustainable development in this ecologically sensitive region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ecological footprints have been assessed widely from a resource production-consumption perspective but much less from a land use per capita availability-demand standpoint. The later view is key to land use policy because it sheds light on the need of changing or adapting uses to get a balance between those of ecological (e.g., forests, riparian wetlands) and those of socioeconomic (e.g., cropland) value. Thus, the purpose of this study was to introduce the LUEF – Land Use Ecological Footprint, defined as the area of a specific use or occupation in a region over the population of that region in a pre-defined timeframe. The index was then applied to the Brazilian territory at the macro region resolution, and to the 2015 – 2019 period. The results identified deforestation, urban densification, cropland/pasture expansion and riparian forest restoration as main drivers of LUEF change in the studied period, as well as supporters of concomitant gross domestic product. The results also revealed negative consequences of LUEF changes for water security and organic carbon stocks in the top layer of soils (decline). Some regional metrics were proposed to revert these consequences, namely the control of urban LUEF above 100 m2/hab to keep water security at the National average level, and of cropland LUEF below 900 m2/hab to preserve organic carbon stock in the macro regions’ topsoils close to the National average (46.9 Mg/ha), reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sequel. The leveling of those LUEFs at the aforementioned values requires intensification of ongoing policy initiatives relevant to mitigate the land use ecological footprints. The study identified various examples, which included the Brazilian Forest Code, the National policies on urban and family agriculture, Payment for Ecosystem Services programs, among others. Overall, the study recognized Brazil as being in the right track to pursue sustainable land use. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Cost-effective adsorbents derived from regenerative sources provide a sustainable solution to the pressing environmental pollution challenges. Conventional studies often rely on biochar-based adsorbents obtained at high carbonization temperatures in an induced environment. The present study explored the efficacy of carbon derived from the stems (CBS) and leaves (CBL) of bamboo plants as efficient dye adsorbents at low carbonization temperatures. CBL carbonized at 350 °C exhibited a remarkable dye adsorption efficiency of 90%, significantly outperforming CBS, which achieved only 39% efficiency. To enable the adsorption of both dyes, heterophase metal oxides, specifically Fe-doped ZnO and ZnFe2O4 were incorporated. Zeta potential measurements revealed a transition from negative to positive values with metal oxide incorporation, suggesting alterations in the surface acidity and functional group composition. The adsorption performance of the composite (WC20) sample was evaluated using Congo Red (CR) and Crystal Violet (CV) dyes. Comprehensive studies on the adsorption kinetics, isotherm modeling, and thermodynamics have been conducted to identify WC20 as the most effective composite. The equilibrium adsorption data aligned well with the Langmuir isotherm model, demonstrating maximum adsorption capacities of 65.31 mg g−1 for CR and 38.05 mg g−1 for CV at room temperature of 298 K with constant pH. Thermodynamic analysis indicated a hybrid adsorption mechanism, wherein CR adsorption was predominantly driven by chemisorption, whereas CV adsorption was governed by physisorption. Mechanistic insights have revealed that electrostatic interactions and π-π stacking play crucial roles in dye removal. These findings underscore the potential applicability of WC20 as a cost-effective and efficient adsorbent for the remediation of both cationic (CV) and anionic (CR) dyes in wastewater, highlighting its viability for future environmental management and pollution mitigation strategies. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the current global context of climate change and the increasing demand for sustainability, optimizing agricultural production is very important in order to meet the demands for food and to mitigate environmental impact. To achieve sustainable agricultural production, particularly in regions with tropical soil and climate conditions, is necessary to adopt conservation-oriented techniques. This includes no-tillage system, the use of soil-cover crops, and the application of inoculants. The objective of this research was, at the end of the 22nd cropping season, to assess the influence of soil compaction in the production of green corn (Zea mays L.) in a long-term field experiment. This study was conducted under different soil tillage systems in a Red-Yellow Ultisol from the Coastal Tablelands of northeastern Brazil. Three soil tillage systems were applied: Conventional Tillage (CT), Minimum Tillage (MT), and No-tillage (NT). These were combined with four previous crops: cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), crotalaria (Crotalaria juncacea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and millet (Pennisetum glaucum), as well as two levels of nitrogen fertilizer application: (1) 100% of the recommended N dose, and (2) 50% of the recommended N dose plus Azospirillum brasilense inoculant. The experimental design consisted of strip plots with subplots divided and randomized within each strip, with three replications. Soil compaction was assessed using parameters of soil density (SD) and soil mechanical resistance to penetration (MRP) in conjunction with moisture content (MC). The principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that conservation-oriented systems exhibited greater soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, leading to increased productivity of commercial green corn cobs. The synergistic effect of diversifying previous crops and adopting conservation tillage systems, especially in soils under long-term tillage, resulted in heightened productivity of commercial green corn ears. © 2024 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Forest restoration, combined with the mitigation of climate change, has attracted significant interest from several stakeholders. This can aid in restoring degraded areas and enhancing carbon storage. Brazil’s global environmental commitments, particularly in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), require substantial financial investments to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Minas Gerais has extensive areas protected by the Legislation for the Protection of Native Vegetation (LPVN) that are not compliant and must be restored in the next 20 years. Geographic data was collected from the government SICAR database. Land use in MG was analyzed using geoprocessing techniques using data from the MapBiomas platform to estimate the area in conflict with LPVN regulations. Minas Gerais has an environmental liability of 3.7 million hectares (Mha) that need restoration in the next 20 years. The Legal Reserve (RL) (2.2 Mha) and Permanent Preservation Areas of watercourses (1.3 Mha) are the most non-compliant protected areas. The “Triângulo Mineiro” and “Norte de Minas” mesoregions have the largest areas in conflict with the LPVN. The Cerrado faces a more critical situation, with approximately 56% of the conflicting areas located there. This study outlines the extent of restoration needed with native vegetation to comply with LPVN requirements in MG. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) present complex biochemical processes of high variability and difficult prediction. This study presents an innovative approach using Machine Learning (ML) models to predict wastewater quality parameters. In particular, the models are applied to datasets from both a simulated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), using DHI WEST software (WEST WWTP), and a real-world WWTP database from Santa Catarina Brewery AMBEV, located in Lages/SC - Brazil (AMBEV WWTP). A distinctive aspect is the evaluation of predictive performance in continuous data scenarios and the impact of changes in WWTP operations on predictive model performance, including changes in plant layout. For both plants, three different scenarios were addressed, and the quality of predictions by random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models were evaluated. The prediction quality by the MLP model reached an R2 of 0.72 for TN prediction in the WEST WWTP output, and the RF model better adapted to the real data of the AMBEV WWTP, despite the significant discrepancy observed between the real and the predicted data. Techniques such as Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Permutation Importance (PI) were used to assess the importance of features, particularly in the simulated WEST tool scenario, showing a strong correlation of prediction results with influent parameters related to nitrogen content. The results of this study highlight the importance of collecting and storing high-quality data and the need for information on changes in WWTP operation for predictive model performance. These contributions advance the understanding of predictive modeling for wastewater quality and provide valuable insights for future practice in wastewater treatment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In tree species, inbreeding due to selfing or biparental mating may decrease offspring adaptation and growth due to inbreeding depression (ID). Degenerative effects of ID, mainly reduction in productivity and survival, are undesirable for ex-situ conservation, improvement, and environmental and commercial reforestation of tree species. The effects of ID resulting from self-fertilization and biparental inbreeding were assessed for the traits cylindrical volume and survival in juvenile individuals of Hymenaea stigonocarpa in a progeny test (0.83 ha) at 4 and 7 years of age. The progeny test was established for ex situ conservation in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and was based on seeds collected from a wild population. Nine microsatellite loci were used to genotype 48 adult (plot = 4.3 ha) and 612 juvenile samples to determine spatial genetic structure (for adults), inbreeding, mating system, and pollen dispersal pattern. Spatial genetic structure was observed up to 82 m. Reproduction occurred mainly by outcrossing, with low rates of selfing (7.5%) and biparental inbreeding (13.2%). Mating was not random due to the fat-tail pollen dispersal pattern, resulting in high pollen immigration (70.1%) and low mean pollen dispersal distance (105 m) within the sample area. Inbreeding was observed only in juveniles, indicating selection against inbred individuals between juvenile and adult stages. The volume trait showed higher ID for biparental inbreeding (41.5–44.0%) than for self-fertilization (29.1–42.6%). Volume also showed greater ID than survival. Our results show that even low rates of selfing and biparental inbreeding can decrease the productivity of H. stigonocarpa plantations. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tropical peatlands play a crucial role in the global ecosystem. These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carbón dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity. © 2024 The author(s).

AB  - The relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (richness–biomass relationship) is a major facet of ecosystem functions and has stimulated debates over the past decades. However, we still lack basic knowledge on whether this relationship has consistent patterns across natural and human-impacted vegetation cover types. More importantly, the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on species richness and aboveground biomass remain controversial. Using data from 197 0.5-ha plots established within a forest-savanna transition ecosystem, we determined three ecological vegetation covers via non-metric multidimensional scaling, obtained gridded climate data and calculated disturbance index from species succession guilds. We examined the consistency of the richness–biomass relationship across the vegetation covers using general linear models and further analysed the effects of disturbance and climatic conditions on this relationship using non-mixed and mixed linear models. We identified three vegetation cover types corresponding to Old-growth forests, Cocoa agroforests and Woodland savannas, suggesting a succession gradient from late-, mid-, and early-successions, respectively. Aboveground biomass consistently increased with species richness across the three vegetation cover types (i.e. positive relationship). Species richness interacts with climate humidity to increase aboveground biomass while interaction of species richness and disturbance rather decreases aboveground biomass consistently across the vegetation cover types. Our results provide insights into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, having implications for ecosystem restoration and understanding ecological consequences of disturbance and climate change in the forest-savanna ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities are vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves due to the decline in permeable green spaces and the emergence of heat islands. To tackle these environmental challenges, many cities adopted ambitious tree-planting initiatives. However, tree tolerance to climate extremes is overlooked even though physiological and growth limitations jeopardize ecosystem services provision. We assessed the responses of Tipuana tipu to the 2013/2014 summer drought in São Paulo, Brazil. We sampled trees in a park and streets and assessed how tree-ring δ13C and growth responses to drought differ. The Regression Tree shows that microhabitats exert the strongest control on tree-ring δ13C seconded by drought. δ13C is on average 1.0‰ higher in streets where growth rate is 60% higher than in the park. Similarly, δ13C increased by up to 0.9‰ during the drought when growth increased by up to 45% in both sites. This positive association between δ13C and growth rate (R2 = 0.78) indicates that growth is limited by assimilation rate. Assimilation is up to 15% higher in streets and increased by up to 10% during the drought because of higher incident sunlight and air temperature. Thus, T. tipu is a drought-tolerant species with potential to contribute to (sub)tropical cities, thriving in a warming climate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eucalyptus species are cultivated for various purposes around the world, mainly because they adapt well and grow quickly. These productive matrices of planted forests are common in Brazil, added to which, areas of native vegetation are requirements of environmental legislation. Although eucalyptus plantations are widely distributed in Brazil, little is known about the soil seed bank (SSB) in the eucalyptus productive matrix (EPM). We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6 months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness, composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence, species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants. These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support actions in ecological restoration projects. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Fire management has proven successful in reducing deforestation, preserving biodiversity and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. After years of zero burning policies in fire-Adapted ecosystems, and resulting increases in fire hazards and risks, countries are moving towards integrated fire management (IFM) including prescribed burning (PB). With a primary focus on biodiversity, Brazilian governmental organizations endorsed this paradigm shift in 2014, with the introduction of IFM in a number of protected areas (PA) of the Cerrado. Reducing high intensity mid/late dry season (M/LDS) fires through PB in the early dry season (EDS) has proven successful in other savanna ecosystems, with demonstrated mitigation potential as EDS fires are associated with lower GHG emissions. In the present study, Earth observation data were used to analyze the seasonality of active fires, burned areas and fuel loads. A dynamic performance benchmark (control-Treatment paired sample test) was applied to assess the effectiveness of existing IFM activities in promoting emission abatement over the pre-covid period 2014 2019. Compared against the responses of PAs without IFM-PB, the PAs with IFM-PB showed significant increases in EDS fires (+137% hotspots) and EDS burned areas (from a share of 11.2% to 29.5% of the total yearly burned area). Fuel fragmentation through EDS-PB, tracked through calibrated fuel load maps, also led to a 62% reduction in burned areas in the IFM period 2014 2019. Combined M/LDS burned areas decreased from 85.1% of the total yearly burned area to a share of 67.7%. When applying the observed shift in fire seasonality and the effect of burned area reduction to all the PA of the Cerrado for the same period, we estimate an emission abatement potential of 1085 764 tCO2e/y. Given the fact that IFM followed a biodiversity-centred approach in the Cerrado, an emission abatement-centered approach could result in even higher abatement potentials. © 2024 Institute of Physics.

AB  - Traditional agroforestry plays a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of local communities, enabling individuals and groups to maximize their potential and make well-informed decisions. The productivity of a successful agroforestry system relies on its adaptability and responsiveness to changing circumstances. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the well-being of the Dulamayo community by examining the performance of their traditional agroforestry system. The assessment of the traditional agroforestry system in Dulamayo was conducted through qualitative description and multiple linear regression calculations. The findings of the study indicate the existence of two types of traditional agroforestry systems in Dulamayo. The first type focuses on fruit production, while the second type involves the production of sap from sugar palm trees in addition to fruits. These systems serve various purposes for food, firewood, medicinal plants, timber for carpentry, complementing traditional and ritual events, and producing items for sale. The estimated productivity value of these systems is US$ 244,482.27 per year. The regression performance model for traditional agroforestry indicates that the independent variable of feelgood source most significantly influences the performance of traditional agroforestry. Farmers' knowledge and awareness regarding the management of traditional agroforestry, particularly for fulfilling their family's food needs, are often quantified in terms of money. They are not aware of the crucial importance of the value of tree types in agroforestry, such as being a source of firewood for cooking, a food source, and traditional herbal medicines. This is within the regression model as an independent variable influencing the performance of traditional agroforestry in Dulamayo. © 2024 Horizon Research Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use change and occupation have led to modifications in the environment causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the planet. Some environments with high economic relevance, such as the ferruginous campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland known as Canga in Brazil), are even more susceptible to severe impacts due to their extreme habitat conditions and low resilience. The determination of reference ecosystems based on the intrinsic characteristics of the ecosystem is essential for conservation as well as to the implementation of ecological restoration. We proposed the reference ecosystem of the three main types of habitats of the ferruginous campo rupestre based on their floristic composition. We described the floristic composition of each habitat and evaluated the physicochemical properties of the soils and the relationship between plants and soils. All three habitats showed high diversity of plant species and many endemic species, such as Chamaecrista choriophylla, Cuphea pseudovaccinium, Lychnophora pinaster, and Vellozia subalata. The distribution of vegetation was strongly related with the edaphic characteristics, with a set of species more adapted to high concentration of base saturation, fine sand, organic carbon, and iron, while another set of species succeeded in more acidic soils with higher S and silt concentration. We provide support for the contention that the ferruginous campo rupestre is a mosaic of different habitats shaped by intrinsic local conditions. Failure to recognize the floristic composition of each particular habitat can lead to inappropriate restoration, increased habitat homogenization and increased loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study also advances the knowledge base for building the reference ecosystem for the different types of ferruginous campo rupestre habitats, as well as a key database for highlighting those species contribute most to community assembly in this diverse and threatened tropical mountain ecosystem. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The northern coast of Java has been more severely affected by sea level rise (SLR) than other islands in the Indonesian archipelago. This warrants a coastal area risk assessment to ascertain the multiple hazards that could impact on this densely populated island. Using environmental and physical variables – including geomorphology, rate of shoreline change, sea level rise, wave height, coastal slope, bathymetry, tidal range, and mangrove density – the main objective of this study is to determine a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) and mangrove vulnerability index (MVI) in the northern Javanese coastline. Assessment was carried out for three regencies – Banten, Demak, and Banyuwangi regency – with the goal of helping to identify areas where mangrove restoration efforts can be prioritized. Using line and 1 × 1 km2 grid representation of the entire coastline, the research found that in terms of CVI, Demak coast is most vulnerable (with 82% of grids and 89% of coastline falling into the highly vulnerable categories), Banten coast ranked as moderately vulnerable (43% of grids and 35% of coastline fall into the moderately vulnerable categories), while 91% of grids and 93% of coastline in Banyuwangi fall into the least vulnerable category. Assessment of mangrove vulnerability revealed that Banten and Banyuwangi regency were low vulnerability as respectively, 100% and 94% of grids fell into this category, while Demak coast was highly vulnerable (with 46% of grids falling into highly vulnerable categories). This vulnerability mapping provides useful information to assist planners and managers to deploy resources for mangrove restoration and the long-term sustainable management of these coastal ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main driver of the energy balance partitioning and influences hydrological and carbon cycles at global, regional and local scales. Furthermore, it is the main requirement for developing strategies to improve water use in agriculture. It is known that there is a close relationship between ET and rainfall, especially in tropical environments. Thus, the main goal of this article was to evaluate how ET and its controls (surface conductance - Gs; decoupling coefficient - Ω; Priestley-Taylor parameter - α) respond to the seasonal variability of meteorological forcing in tropical grazed pastures under the climatic conditions of Northeast Brazil. ET was measured using an Eddy covariance (EC) system and analyzed based on data from two agricultural years (2015–2016 and 2016–2017) with negative (-59 mm) and positive (356 mm) rainfall anomaly, respectively. ET exhibited pronounced seasonality, closely aligned with the seasonality of rainfall. Lower daily averages were observed during the dry season in both agricultural years (1.01 ± 0.60 and 0.89 ± 0.44 mm, respectively). On the other hand, higher daily averages were observed during the rainy season (2.44 ± 0.75 and 4.83 ± 0.96 mm, respectively). The Gs patterns and the significant correlation between Gs, Ω, and α (p < 0.01) indicate that surface control prevails over atmospheric control on an annual scale. This finding is confirmed by the annual mean values of Ω (0.27, 2015–2016) and α (0.38, 2016–2017). This relationship is likely induced by a vegetative stomatal control mechanism, which protects the vegetation against excessive water loss during periods of high temperatures and low humidity levels. These findings are crucial for understanding how droughts modulate components of the energy balance and water fluxes in pastures, especially given the intensification of these events. This has implications for the implementation of climate change mitigation policies and soil management. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Increasing aridity associated with climate change may lead to the crossing of critical ecosystem thresholds in drylands, compromising ecosystem services for millions of people. In this context, finding tools to detect at early stages the effects of increasing aridity on ecosystems is extremely urgent to avoid irreversible damage. Here, we assess shifts in plant community functional structure along a spatial aridity gradient in tropical dryland (Brazilian Caatinga), to select the most appropriate plant functional groups as ecological indicators likely useful to predict temporal ecosystem trajectories in response to aridity. We identified seven plant functional groups based on 13 functional traits associated with plant establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal, whose relative abundances changed, linearly and non-linearly, with increasing aridity, showing either increasing or decreasing trends. Of particular importance is the increase in abundance of plants with high chemical defense and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway, with increasing aridity. We propose the use of these functional groups as early warning indicators to detect aridity impacts on these dryland ecosystems and shifts in ecosystem functioning. This information can also be used in the elaboration of mitigation and ecological restoration measures to prevent and revert current and future climate change impacts on tropical dry forests. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Urban forest soils play a pivotal role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of cities, contributing to various natural processes, including plant–microbe interactions, microbial activity, and the decomposition of organic matter. Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of São Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, δ13C and δ15N, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; δ15N - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; δ13C - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. δ13C and δ15N contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient. These shed light results how integrating NbS principles into strategic urban planning and city-level climate policies can bolster the effectiveness of urban green areas. The integration not only promotes carbon sequestration and efficient nutrient cycling in the soil but also fosters sustainable practices, contributing to a more resilient urban landscape. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study investigates the sustainability of potential small hydropower sites within the Citarum Watershed in West Java, Indonesia. The Citarum River, with a catchment area of 6,090 km2, plays a crucial role in regional water supply and hydroelectric power generation. However, environmental challenges such as deforestation, land use changes, and sedimentation pose significant risks. We employed the CA-Markov model integrated with IDRISI TerrSet software and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to predict future land use changes and assess water supply, soil erosion, and sedimentation impacts for 2030 and 2040. The analysis revealed diverse trends in water yield across different catchment areas, with some regions showing increased water availability and others facing declines. High erosion and sedimentation rates were identified as critical issues affecting hydropower efficiency. The study highlights the need for comprehensive watershed management strategies, including reforestation, sustainable land management practices, and sediment management, to enhance the sustainability of small hydropower projects. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating environmental considerations into hydropower development to ensure the ecological integrity of the Citarum Watershed. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The behavior of ruminants can influence their productive efficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of young zebu and composite bulls kept in pasture production systems, either in a crop-livestock-forest integration or without afforestation. The work was carried out in São Carlos, Brazil (21°57′42″ S, 47°50′28″ W), in a high-altitude tropical climate, from March to July, 2022. Forty young bulls were evaluated, being 20 Nelore (Bos indicus) (342.5 ± 36.6 kg BW; 16.9 ± 1.8 months) and 20 Canchim (5/8 Bos taurus × 3/8 Bos indicus) (338.4 ± 39.8 kg BW; 19.1 ± 1.9 months), equally distributed in full-sun (FS) and integrated crop–livestock–forestry (ICLF) production systems. Behavior was monitored uninterruptedly by an acoustic sensor and accelerometer attached to a collar, and complemented by direct visual assessment, in two one-day campaigns per month. Serum cortisol concentration was assessed monthly. Statistical analyses were conducted using a general linear model at a 5% significance level (SAS, version 9.4). The ICLF system had a milder microclimate and favored thermal comfort. Natural shading influenced grazing, resting, and rumination time. The Canchim bulls were more active when moving and grazing (p < 0.05), even at the hottest times of the day. In turn, the Nelore bulls spent more time resting at all times (p < 0.001), which was shown to be an adaptive strategy in response to environmental stimuli. The Canchim bulls had a longer rumination time than the Nelore bulls (p < 0.001), due to their longer grazing time. The frequency of water and mineral mixture intake did not differ between genotypes, regardless of the production system (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the serum cortisol concentrations of the Nelore and Canchim bulls kept in FS or ICLF (p = 0.082). Thus, young bulls of the different genotypes showed different behaviors, regardless of whether they were kept on pasture without afforestation or in an integrated crop–livestock–forestry system. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In agroforestry systems, such as integrated crop-livestock-forest (iCLF), the agricultural, livestock and arboreal components are explored in the same field in rotation, succession or intercropping. Our objective was to investigate if the diameter growth of eucalyptus in agroforestry systems differs from those cultivated as a planted forest, as well as to assess whether there is a difference in its growth in face of the air temperature and precipitation. The study was held at Ponta Porã, Brazil, a region of humid subtropical climate with hot summers and soil classified as Oxisol, which is fertile, deep and clayey. Dendrometer bands measured the diameter growth of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urograndis) cultivated as a forest and in iCLF, with eucalyptus rows distance of 12.5 × 12.5 m, 12.5 m one side × 25 m another side and 25 × 25 m. The study took place from four years and nine months after transplanting till six years and seven months (22 months monitoring). On iCLF, the inter-row was explored with grain crops (soybean or corn) and pasture. Climate data of air temperature and precipitation were used to investigate their influence or not on diameter growth. Eucalyptus diameter growth is higher when cultivated in agroforestry systems and this growth is as higher as larger is the distance between eucalyptus rows. Precipitation proved to strongly and positively influence the diameter growth, especially when cultivated in agroforestry systems. On the other hand, under the conditions of this study, air temperature showed little or no correlation with eucalyptus diameter growth.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the quality and reuse potential of treated effluents by constructed wetlands (CW) systems utilized for decentralized wastewater treatment in urban and rural scenarios in southern Brazil. The assessment, based on Brazilian discharge standards and wastewater reuse guidelines, revealed a close link between treatment efficiency and technological configurations, considering diverse inlet wastewater sources. Most CW treated effluents complied with regulatory standards for disposal, prompting the exploration of reuse scenarios in urban and agricultural settings. However, the study underscores the imperative for rigorous disinfection due to the limited microbiological removal capacity of CW. Overall, the research emphasizes the adaptability and resilience of CW in treating diverse wastewater compositions, highlighting their pivotal role in advancing circular economy principles within sanitation services. Importantly, the findings suggest significant potential for treated wastewater reuse in both urban and agricultural settings. Urban applications, including toilet flushing, floor washing, and garden irrigation, prove feasible for CW systems situated in residential and commercial buildings. Meanwhile, rural CW systems demonstrate suitability for reclaimed water directed toward crop fertigation, tailored to the specific needs and irrigation methods of various crops. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change poses challenges to infrastructure resilience in Southeast Asia’s flood-prone regions. This study identifies and evaluates strategies for enhancing infrastructure resilience through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyzed the case studies and conducted quantitative assessments of flood mitigation efforts. Data were collected (2021-2024) through site visits, interviews with key stakeholders, and analysis of historical flood and infrastructure performance data. Data analysis involved statistical methods for assessing their effectiveness and comparative analyses across them. Singapore reduced flood-prone areas by 30% using integrated WWTP technologies with drainage systems, while Malaysia developed resilient infrastructure networks with WWTPs designed to withstand extreme weather, preventing 85% of contamination cases. Thailand combined green and blue infrastructure with WWTPs, decreasing flood vulnerability by 25%. Indonesia invested in decentralized WWTPs in urban areas, increasing infrastructure resilience by 40%. Nature-based solutions, such as ecological restoration, reduce flooding impacts by 20%. The implications for policymakers and practitioners include the need to integrate advanced technologies and nature-based solutions to bolster infrastructure resilience and mitigate flooding risks. This study offers insights into developing effective climate change adaptation strategies in flood-vulnerable regions, emphasizing the critical role of WWTPs in enhancing infrastructure resilience. © 2024 American Chemical Society

AB  - Tropical climate-smart agriculture could be a cost-effective and scalable nature-based solution toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the coming decades. Nevertheless, the lack of integrated on-farm CO2, CH4, and N2O flux measurements remains a barrier to including these systems in certification programs and the carbon (C) market. This systematic literature review critically examines field-measured GHG emission studies within climate-smart agri-systems in Brazil, aiming to: (i) integrate GHG-measured data, (ii) explore geographical representativeness and connections between organizations and authors, (iii) analyze distributions of studied GHG molecules, climate-smart system types, and productive components, (iv) conduct a meta-analysis on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture, and (v) identify methodological and scope gaps, providing insights for future research directions. The systems considered include no-till, well-managed pasture, integrated crop-livestock, and integration with trees (i.e., crop-forestry, livestock-forestry, crop-livestock-forestry, and multistrata agroforestry). Out of 1200 papers mentioning GHGs and climate-smart systems, 74 contained reliable on-farm flux measurements. Most authors were Brazilians affiliated with Embrapa and public Universities. Studies concentrated on the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, with scarce data for other biomes. Over half of the trials assessed individual GHG molecules and only one climate-smart system. Urochloa spp. and Avena spp. were the most studied forage genera, while soybeans and corn dominated annual crops. Eucalyptus spp. and beef cattle were common trees and animals. No-till, integrated crop-livestock, and agricultural integrations involving trees showed soil C–CH4 influx from 0.8 to 1.0 kg ha−1 y−1. Transitioning from pasture monoculture to integrated systems decreased N–N2O emissions by up to 1.63 kg ha−1 y−1. Converting extensive grazed land to intensified-integrated systems reduced animal CH4 intensity, with cuts of up to 122 g CH4 per kg of average daily weight gain. Future research must urgently address methodological issues, such as de-standardization (e.g., 8–10 flux units found per GHG molecule) and the absence of crucial ancillary variables. In conclusion, adopting diversified climate-smart agri-systems shows potential to mitigate GHG emissions, but caution is advised when extrapolating our numerical findings due to limited data across Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions. We urge scientists to prioritize frequent on-farm measurements of all three GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) along with agroecosystem C sequestration across multiple climate-smart systems, enabling reliable and comparable net GHG flux calculations to identify the most sustainable option. Advancing and standardizing GHG measurements in Brazil offer an opportunity to enhance GHGs inventory accuracy, calibrate models, and promote policies and investments that expand refined tropical climate-smart agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding climate change and land use impacts is crucial for mitigating environmental degradation. This study assesses the environmental vulnerability of the Doce River Basin for 2050, considering future climate change and land use and land cover (LULC) scenarios. Factors including slope, elevation, relief dissection, precipitation, temperature, pedology, geology, urban distance, road distance, and LULC were evaluated using multicriteria analysis. Regional climate models Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios were employed. The Land Change Modeler tool simulated 2050 LULC changes and hypothetical reforestation of legal reserve (RL) areas. Combining two climate and two LULC scenarios resulted in four future vulnerability scenarios. Projections indicate an over 300 mm reduction in average annual precipitation and an up to 2 °C temperature increase from 2020 to 2050. Scenario 4 (RCP 8.5 and LULC for 2050 with reforested RLs) showed the greatest basin area in the lowest vulnerability classes, while scenario 3 (RCP 4.5 and LULC for 2050) exhibited more high-vulnerability areas. Despite the projected relative improvement in environmental vulnerability by 2050 due to reduced rainfall, the complexity of associated relationships must be considered. These results contribute to mitigating environmental damage and adapting to future climatic conditions in the Doce River Basin. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This study aimed to review the impact of land use change and mangrove degradation on coastal areas and analyze the problems and strategies of mangrove management in Indonesia. Journal data sources were obtained from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was used in the study. The results indicate that economic activities such as mining, industry, and ponds are the main cause of mangrove damage, which in turn leads to increased disasters, CO2 emissions, and decreased community income. To address this issue, mangrove management strategies that take into account social, economic, and environmental factors are necessary. Successful mangrove restoration requires increased inclusion, community capacity, budgeting, and stakeholder involvement. Government policies regulating sustainable spatial planning, law enforcement, and institutional frameworks are crucial components of mangrove management. The study's results are expected to serve as the foundation for developing sustainable coastal management strategies that enhance the safety of coastal communities from disasters and improve their welfare. © 2024 Brawijaya University.

AB  - Adjustments in Brazilian livestock are necessary to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, since the largest source of methane comes from ruminants' enteric fermentation, and of carbon from deforestation. Low-carbon agriculture technologies (LCAT) contribute to mitigating these emissions and this study evaluates the role of these technologies on ruminant forage production in Caatinga. A Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats analysis was used to elucidate the main features, followed by an Analytic Hierarchical Process, ranking the LCAT, and a risk analysis. Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (ICLFS) is the most recommended technology, followed by Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and Recovery of Degraded Areas with Pastures (RDA-P). The results can aid in the choice of the LCAT to be implemented by the smallholder in Caatinga, demonstrating the need to strengthen rural technical assistance, so that there is a real benefit to the producer and the environment. © 2024 Universidad Nacional de Trujillo.

AB  - One of the major setbacks in environmental restoration is how to promote the arrival of propagules in degraded areas, and this issue is intensified at sites without vegetation, where natural dispersal is limited. To overcome this issue, one of the methods employed is the use of artificial perches, intended for attracting seed-dispersing birds, providing perching sites, and thus, facilitating the formation of vegetation nuclei from the seeds that are excreted, regurgitated, or accidentally dropped. The aim of this study was to quantify and identify the birds that used the artificial perches in a degraded area on the margins of the Forqueta River, RS, Brazil, in order to evaluate their effectiveness as an ecological restoration method. Over one year, 11 bird species were observed to use the perches. Despite the presence of birds, there was no significant seed germination at the base of the perches. Absence of frugivorous species and adverse conditions of the soil might have contributed to this result. Previous studies showed diverging results on the effectiveness of artificial perches, indicating the need for considering several factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of invasive species. The present study highlights the complexity of ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded areas and the importance of adaptive approaches to reach effective results. © 2024, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - The interaction between high fire frequency and long flooding seasons maintains open vegetation in floodplains, while low fire frequency and no flooding can lead to forest development. In the Kadiwéu Indigenous Territory (IT), in the ecotone between the Cerrado and the Pantanal biomes in Brazil, the diversified spatio-temporal patterns of fire activity affect the diversity of floral functional traits and plant phenological strategies. Given this scenario, we sampled tree and non-tree species abundance data in 156 plots subject to different flood levels and fire frequencies in the Kadiwéu IT. Based on flooding regimes and fire frequency data series from 2001 to 2021, we classify the sample sites as floodable or flood-free areas under high (annual or biennial burn), moderate (three-yearly burn), or low (burning at four-year intervals or more) fire frequency. We analyzed the effects of flooding and fire frequency on plant species richness, abundance, and beta diversity (β). In general, tree density did not affect non-tree species richness. The species richness on the patches with different fire frequency category was generally similar, especially regarding the tree species. However, the combined effect of fire and flooding shifted the species composition. Variability in fire frequency across the landscapes support β-diversity maintenance in ecotonal vegetation between tropical wetlands and savannas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between floodable and flood-free areas at the same fire frequency category is low due to differences in abundance and species replacement. As part of adaptive fire management, we suggest maintaining a heterogeneous mosaic of fire frequencies in the landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes alter the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, impacting the potential and flow of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration projects aiming to enhance native vegetation have proven effective in mitigating the impacts of LULC changes on ecosystem services. A key element in implementing these projects has been identifying priority areas for restoration, considering that resources allocated to such projects are often limited. This study proposes a novel methodological framework to identify priority areas for restoration and guide LULC planning to increase the provision of water ecosystem services (WESs) in a watershed in southeastern Brazil. To do so, we combined biophysical models and multicriteria analysis to identify priority areas for ecological restoration, propose environmental zoning for the study area, and quantify the effects of LULC changes and of a planned LULC scenario (implemented environmental zoning) on WES indicators. Previous LULC changes, from 1985 to 2019, have resulted in a nearly 20% increase in annual surface runoff, a 50% increase in sediment export, a 22% increase in total nitrogen (TN) export, and a 53% increase in total phosphorus (TP) export. Simultaneously, they reduced the provision of WESs (baseflow −27%, TN retention −10%, and TP retention −16%), except for sediment retention, which increased by 35% during the analyzed period. The planned LULC scenario successfully increased the provision of WESs while reducing surface runoff and nutrient and sediment exports. The methodology employed in this study proved to be effective in guiding LULC planning for improving WES. The obtained results provide a scientific foundation for guiding the implementation of WES conservation policies in the studied watershed. This method is perceived to be applicable to other watersheds. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Biochar amendment has emerged as a potential solution for preventing, remediating, and mitigating agricultural compound pollution. This groundbreaking technique not only improves crucial soil properties like porosity, water retention capacity, cation exchange capacity, and pH, but also intricately impacts the interaction and retention mechanisms of polluting molecules. In this study, we investigate the dynamic of the herbicide Imazapic when subjected to applying pyrolyzed biochars, specifically at temperatures of 300 and 500 °C, within the context of a low-fertility soil characterized as dystrophic Yellow Ultisol (YUd) in a sugarcane cultivation area in Igarassu-PE, Brazil. The biochars were produced from sugarcane bagasse by pyrolysis process in a muffle furnace. In laboratory conditions, with saturated soil columns under steady-state, analyses of the mechanisms involved in interaction and transport and determining hydrodispersive parameters for Imazapic were performed by the two-site nonequilibrium transport model using the CXTFIT 2.0 program. Samples of YUd soil amended with biochar pyrolyzed at 300 °C presented a negligible interaction with Imazapic. However, adding biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C (BC500) to the soil samples enhanced the adsorption coefficient and improved the interaction with Imazapic. This research points out that biochar produced from agricultural waste biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse specifically pyrolyzed at 500 °C, offers a potential means to adsorb herbicides, reducing their leaching to deeper layers of the amended soils and the risk of groundwater contamination and potential environmental negative impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for quantifying the carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Tropical secondary forests are significant carbon sinks that sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide. While recent studies have attempted to estimate the AGB recovery rates in tropical forests, considerable uncertainty remains in the estimation of AGB recovery of secondary forests and the spatial variability of the effects that different environmental conditions and degrees of human use may have on AGB recovery. These knowledge gaps hinder further understanding of climate change mitigation potential of secondary forests. Remote sensing products provide spatially and temporally explicit information for understanding and monitoring secondary forest dynamics. To explore the local effects of different factors on AGB of secondary forests in Brazil, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that account for spatial heterogeneity in geospatial data to estimate the AGB of secondary forests in Brazil. Secondary forest areas (29142 polygons) were extracted from Brazil's forest age maps between 1984 and 2019. The AGB of these areas was derived from the Climate Change Initiative Biomass maps. The effects of selected predictors such as forest age, climatic water deficit, the cation exchange capacity of soil and surrounding tree cover were analyzed. The two most influential factors, forest age and surrounding tree cover were utilized to estimate the AGB and the recovery rates per year. Our results show the high spatial variation of different predictors’ effects on the AGB of secondary forests. Also, the GWR model (with an adjusted R2 of 0.74) showed considerable improvements regarding “goodness of fit” of models compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (with an adjusted R2 of 0.53). Our estimated average AGB recovery rate across all Brazil's biomes is 7.5 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (using forest age) for the first 20 years. We presented the map of the spatial variation of AGB recovery rates in Brazil. The estimated AGB recovery rates range using forest age is 28.9 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Our estimated mean AGB recovery rates of different biomes are 17.7 % on average higher than IPCC default rates. Our results provide baseline information for reducing uncertainties related to carbon sink estimation of secondary forests in Brazil, hence assisting in developing sustainable forest management and ecosystem restoration strategies. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Water scarcity has become a critical global concern exacerbated by population growth, globalization, and industrial expansion, resulting in the production of wastewater containing a wide array of contaminants. Tackling this challenge necessitates the adoption of innovative materials and technologies for effective wastewater treatment. This review article provides a comprehensive exploration of the preparation, applications, mechanisms, and economic environmental analysis of zeolite-based composites in wastewater treatment. Zeolite, renowned for its versatility and porous nature, is of paramount importance due to its exceptional properties, including high surface area, ion exchange capability, and adsorption capacity. Various synthetic methods for zeolite-based composites are discussed. The utilization of zeolites in wastewater treatment, particularly in adsorption and photocatalysis, is thoroughly investigated. The significance of zeolite in adsorption and its role in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants are examined, along with its applications in treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dye wastewater, oil-field wastewater, and radioactive waste. Mechanisms underlying zeolite-based adsorption and photocatalysis, including physical and chemical adsorption, ion exchange, and surface modification, are elucidated. Additionally, the role of micropores in the adsorption process is explored. Furthermore, the review delves into regeneration and desorption studies of zeolite-based composites, crucial for sustainable wastewater treatment practices. Economic and environmental analyses are conducted to assess the feasibility and sustainability of employing zeolite-based composites in wastewater treatment applications. Future recommendations are provided to guide further research and development in the field of zeolite-based composites, aiming to enhance wastewater treatment efficiency and environmental sustainability. By exploring the latest advancements and insights into zeolite-based nanocomposites, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment strategies. The integration of zeolite-based materials in wastewater treatment processes shows promise for mitigating water pollution and addressing water scarcity challenges, ultimately contributing to environmental preservation and public health protection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper evaluates the socioeconomic, land use change, and greenhouse gases emissions impacts of degraded pastures recovery (DPR) in Brazil, assessing the contribution to the Brazilian Paris Agreement commitments. We used a Computable General Equilibrium model, TERM-BR15, in a scenario simulation for the period 2015–2035. The simulation includes DPR shocks of productivity, investments, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) fixation. We used two carbon accounting methods for the impacts on emissions, the original method of Brazil's emissions inventory, which does not consider SOC, and the alternative method, which includes SOC fixation. Results show a 0.56% growth in Gross Domestic Product and 0.73% in real household consumption relative to the 2035 baseline. There would be a social return of R$80.5 billion (in 2023 prices), representing R$8.27 for every real invested. Less developed and more dependent on cattle ranching regions would benefit the most. Cattle ranching would expand production using less area, resulting in a land-saving effect of 1.15 million hectares in 2035. GHG emissions would increase by 7.83% in the original accounting method, resulting from herd and economic growth. In the alternative method, 0.23% mitigation would occur, showing that SOC fixation can more than offset the economic activity growth. Independently of the GHG accounting method Brazil would achieve the 2025 mitigation target of 37% relative to 2005 but would not meet the 50% mitigation target of 2030. SOC fixation could contribute up to 5.7% of the 2030 mitigation target. Our results show that DPR is a sustainable production system that increases economic growth, avoids deforestation, and could mitigate GHG emissions. We provide information on regional impacts suitable for better decision-making for pasture restoration incentives in Brazil. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change causes sea levels to rise, threatening the lives of people living on coastal islands. However, none has studied how communities can adapt to the changing environment and build climate resilience. To address this issue, the work unlocks adaptation strategies for climate-induced sea level rise in coastal islands. The Thousand Islands (Indonesia) was used as a case study due to their low-lying areas and reliance on agriculture. This work identifies best practices and local challenges due to climate change that could be applicable to other coastal regions. Data collection was undertaken through semistructured interviews with stakeholders. It is evident that adaptation strategies in coastal regions need to be participatory due to the importance of local knowledge and community empowerment. Community’s adaptation initiatives include mangrove restoration and giant seawall construction. There was a 15% increase in species richness and a 10% increase in ecosystem resilience in areas where adaptive measures were applied. The barriers of climate adaptation cover the lack of resources and institutional constraints. It is crucial for the government to collaborate with stakeholders to implement climate adaptation strategies based on local needs. Overall, this work highlights the need for regional collaboration to tackle climate impacts on the rising sea level in coastal areas. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A. auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis along the urban–rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A. auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations, including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A. auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A. auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their role in the restoration of degraded lands. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The conversion of native vegetation to agricultural areas leads to a natural process of carbon loss but these systems can stabilize in terms of carbon dynamics depending on the management and conversion time, presenting potential to both store and stabilize this carbon in the soil, resulting in lower soil respiration rates. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effect of converting native Cerrado forest areas to agricultural systems with a forest planted with Eucalyptus camaldulensis and silvopastoral systems on the dynamics of CO2 emission and carbon stock at different soil depths. The experimental sites are located in the Midwest of Brazil, in the coordinates 20°22′31″ S and 51°24′12″ W. Were evaluated soil CO2 emission (FCO2), soil organic carbon, the degree of humification of soil organic matter (HLIFS), soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil chemical and physical attributes. The soil of the area is classified as an Oxisol (Haplic Acrustox). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30, and 0.30–0.40 m. The lowest FCO2 values were found in the silvopastoral system (1.05 μmol m−2 s−1), followed by the native forest (1.65 μmol m−2 s−1) and the eucalyptus system (1.96 μmol m−2 s−1), indicating a 36% reduction in FCO2 compared to the conversion of the native forest to the silvopastoral system and an increase of 19% when converting the native forest to the eucalyptus system. The soil chemical attributes (N, K+, Ca2+, H++Al3+, CEC, and organic carbon) showed a decrease along the profile. The shallowest depths (0.00–0.10 and 0.10–0.20 m) presented no differences between systems but the subsequent depths (0.20–0.30 and 0.30–0.40 m) had a difference (95% confidence interval), relative to N, Ca2+, H++Al3, CEC, and organic carbon stock (OCS), and the soil under silvopastoral system showed a higher concentration of these attributes than the native forest. The multivariate analysis showed that the eucalyptus and silvopastoral systems did not differ from the forest in the shallowest soil layer but differed from each other. This behavior changed from the second assessed depth (0.10–0.20 m), in which the silvopastoral system stands out, differing both from the eucalyptus system and from the native forest, and this behavior is maintained at the following depths (0.20–0.30 and 0.30–0.40 m). OCS, H++Al3, CEC, and nitrogen are strongly related to land use change for silvopastoral system. Regarding the behavior/relationship of attributes as a function of depth, the silvopastoral system contributed to soil carbon accumulation and stability over consecutive years. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil-plant simulation models have been ever more used as predictive tools to evaluate productivity and environmental impacts of agriculture practices. The aims of this work were to evaluate the STICS model's capacity of simulate the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) under different management systems. And, to predict, by applying the calibrated and validated STICS model, the N2O emissions, under different management systems, in the edaphoclimatic conditions of the Brazilian Cerrado. The study was conducted in a long-term experiment at Embrapa Cerrados, located in Planaltina/DF, Brazil. The experiment started in 1995. The following land use systems were evaluated: CT - conventional tillage with disc harrow, and biannual grass/legume rotation; NT1 - No-tillage, with biannual crop rotation – soybean/sorghum; NT2 - No-tillage, with biannual crop rotation – maize/pigeon pea.Closed static chambers and gas sample analysis by gas chromatography were used to measure N2O fluxes. The model was calibrated with the data measured in the CT and NT1 treatments. The attributes used in the calibration were: growth, development and yield of crops and N2O fluxes. To test the model, data from the NT2 treatment was used. Data for all treatments were collected at the same time. After calibration and validation, the STICS model was used to predict the effects of soil management systems, conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) on greenhouse gas emissions and on grain and biomass crops production. The simulation was made for the period from 2021 to 2070. The STICS model performed well at simulation of the following parameters: N2O emissions, soil water dynamics, soil temperature; and leaf area, aerial biomass and grain yield of soybean and maize. The performance of the model was good for the conventional soil management system as well as in the no-tillage system. Based on the predicted increase in temperature for the period 2021–2070, we can conclude from the data generated through the STICS model that there is strong evidence that grain yield and total aerial biomass of plants will decrease. The data show that there is a rising tendency in N2O emissions over the simulated period. This is expected to occur for the two soil management systems studied (NT and CT). We believe this increase in emissions along the years is related to temperature increase and to the reduction of crop cycle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

AB  - To reconcile environmental issues with socioeconomic development, the mitigation hierarchy emerges as a pivotal strategy that sequentially addresses environmental impacts through a structured approach of avoidance, minimization, remediation, and offsetting. No net loss (NNL) is achieved when biodiversity gains from all four mitigation stages are larger than the project's environmental impacts. Here, we assessed biodiversity changes linked to the implementation of the S11D Eliezer Batista iron mining Complex in the Carajás National Forest, Pará state, Brazil, expecting losses due to mining activities and gains through forest restoration offsets. We evaluated biodiversity stocks based on Biotic Value as the product of habitat importance and actual conditions. Habitat importance, a unique value for each class of land cover recognized within the study site, is based on the evaluation of habitat naturalness, rarity and endangerment, and substitutability. Actual conditions are computed from field-surveyed key ecological attributes of vegetation structure, community composition and diversity, and ecological processes, and forest restoration activities are able to restitute, within 4–6 years only, approximately 73 % of old-growth forest conditions. The Biotic Value ranges from 0 for mine lands to 1 for patchy savanna formations stocking above ironstone outcrops (locally known as cangas) and amounts to 0.43 units/ha for secondary forests. Between 2008 and 2021, we detected comprehensive land-use changes in the study area: Cangas, farmlands and old-growth forests decreased, while secondary forests and minelands increased considerably. Despite environmental degradation, the emergence of secondary forests contributed to a positive biodiversity balance within the areas managed by the mining company (+379 units), while biodiversity losses dominated outside the company's boundaries (−171 units). Although like-for-like compensation of canga impacts remains challenging, we thus conclude that forest restoration efforts initiated by the mining company effectively reversed the trajectory of environmental degradation prevailing in the landscape and provided considerable biodiversity gains for the region. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Fires occurring over the peatlands in Indonesian Borneo accompanied by droughts have posed devastating impacts on human health, livelihoods, economy and the natural environment, and their prevention requires comprehensive understanding of climate-associated risk. Although it is widely known that the droughts are associated with El Niño events, the onset process of El Niño and thus the drought precursors and their possible changes under the future climate are not clearly understood. Here, we use a causal network approach to quantify the strength of teleconnections to droughts at a seasonal timescale shown in observations and climate models. We portray two drivers of June-July-August (JJA) droughts identified through literature review and causal analysis, namely Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) in JJA (El Niño Southern Oscillation [abbreviated as ENSO]) and SST anomaly over the eastern North Pacific to the east of the Hawaiian Islands (abbreviated as Pacific SST) in March-April-May (MAM) period. We argue that the droughts are strongly linked to ENSO variability, with drier years corresponding to El Niño conditions. The droughts can be predicted with a lead time of 3 months based on their associations with Pacific SST, with higher SST preceding drier conditions. We find that under the SSP585 scenario, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensembles show significant increase in both the maximum number of consecutive dry days in the Indonesian Borneo region in JJA (p = 0.006) and its linear association with Pacific SST in MAM (p = 0.001) from year 2061 to 2100 compared with the historical baseline. Some models are showing unrealistic amounts of JJA rainfall and underestimate drought risks in Indonesian Borneo and their teleconnections, owing to the underestimation of ENSO amplitude and overestimation of local convections. Our study strengthens the possibility of early warning triggers of fires and stresses the need for taking enhanced climate risk into consideration when formulating long-term policies to eliminate fires. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Male and female dioecious trees often differ in their sensitivity to environmental stress, resulting in unbalanced sex ratios that can affect forest regeneration. Dioecious species are thus especially vulnerable to climate change, which can intensify their sexual bias. We investigated the sex ratio in endangered pehuén (Araucaria araucana) forests to determine whether there is an imbalance in ratio at different spatial scales, and if so, whether this is climate-dependent. To assess deviations in sex ratios on local and regional scales, we quantified the proportion of males along 37 transects within 11 patches in two populations. To assess the sex–climate relationship, we used WorldClim data; for the biogeographic scale, we added published sex ratio information from other populations. We found a bias towards males, both locally and regionally. On a local scale, this bias was related to heterogeneous temperature conditions, especially in patches with particularly wet or hot summers. On a biogeographic scale, this bias increased in warmer and humid conditions. The male bias we found implies a direct reduction in the effective size of these already threatened forests. Considering climate change projections for Patagonia, predicting an increase in temperatures and their anomalies, our results suggest that males would be less affected than females; this points to an intensification of the male bias, and thus to increased vulnerability of these already endangered pehuén forests. This study provides evidence of climate-dependent sex bias in threatened dioecious forests, and discusses its importance in the context of climate change. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change exerts impacts on biodiversity and coastal ecosystems. Given the socio-economic and environmental significance of coastal zones, preventative and mitigative measures are imperative to address the damages resulting from erosive processes and coastal flooding. The state of Rio de Janeiro, with its 1160 km of coastline, holds ecological, socio-economic, and logistical importance in Brazil, necessitating the safeguarding of these assets. We employed the InVEST modeling program to assess coastal vulnerability, incorporating data on populations, logistical infrastructure (ports and aerodromes), and priority areas for fauna protection. Our findings revealed that the state of Rio de Janeiro faces coastal risks ranging from intermediate to high at 66 %, and a substantial portion of legally protected areas does not encompass habitats near the coast. We illustrated the pivotal role of habitats in coastal protection, emphasizing that their removal would significantly augment coastal vulnerability. The amalgamation of these factors allowed us to propose adaptation strategies based on nature-based solutions to address environmental and socio-economic challenges. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current adaptation strategies are emphasized based on expanding the community's preparedness. A few discuss increasing resilience by lowering the house's vulnerability. Therefore, we aimed to develop suitable adaptation strategies for houses in a landslide-prone settlement area. We conducted a household survey accompanied by descriptive and cross-tabulation analysis to understand the risk and vulnerability of the houses. We then constructed the adaptation strategies based on the vulnerability assessment of the element at risk. We also estimated the cost of implementing the adaptation strategy as an important finding in this study. The element at risk of landslide-prone settlement of Giripurno Village consists of two groups: houses buried by landslides and houses buried the other sites. Most houses buried by landslides belong to the least secure typology characterized by a low distance to the slope and high landslide deposits. Many houses buried the other sites belong to the most dangerous typology, indicated by their location in an unsafe zone and the absence of a retaining wall. The suitable adaptation strategies are shifting the house to avoid the danger zone, elevating the house to prevent landslide deposits to bury them and give a secure place to evacuate, retrofitting the house by closing the opening and coating the wall with wire mesh, and building a retaining wall. Adaptation strategy cost estimation becomes the key finding. The cost of landslide adaptation strategies through house alteration is lower than implementing agroforestry management. Thus, this adaptation measure can be considered a critical long-term adaptation against landslides. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seed orchards are important seed resources for producing improved tree crops for future plantations, forest restoration, and forestry practices (i.e., gene conservation) and for transmitting current gene diversity to future generations. Seed orchards are a major sub-division in forest science. The establishment and management of a seed orchard involves many steps, from the selection of superior trees to the harvesting of a seed crop. Studying the trends and future directions of seed orchards using different analysis methods is critically important, especially to establish resistant forests via the production of climate-smart, biotic/abiotic-stress-resistant seedling materials. Published papers related to seed orchards should be analyzed to determine the current trends in this field and to contribute to its future directions. Bibliometric analysis has been used for different purposes in various scientific fields. However, it has not been performed for publications in seed orchards. This study was carried out to analyze the current trends of research on seed orchards and to determine the future directions of these orchards based on published papers. For these purposes, 1018 published papers were obtained from the Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, and citation index databases of “Web of Science” using the keyword “seed orchard”. The papers were published between 1980 and 2022 and were subjected to bibliometric analysis based on the most prolific contributors, references, countries, and keywords. CiteSpace software 6.1 R6 was applied to visualize information about seed orchard research. The average number of citations per publication was 13.05, and the 4 H-Index of the publication set was 48. The most prolific contributors with the strongest citation bursts, the highest centrality, and the greatest numbers of published papers were from Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Finland, and Czech Republic, while Canada (186 published articles), the USA (140), and Sweden (115), together with China, Brazil, and Germany, were active countries, especially based on citations from recent years. The “keywords” of the papers were the core of the research. “Mating pattern”, “Swedish forestry”, “fertility variation”, “Hymenoscyphus fraxineus”, “threatened Pacific sandalwood”, “outbreeding depression”, “climate change”, “management”, and “growth”, together with others such as “genetic improvement” and “effective size”, were active study areas and keywords, based on results of the analysis. They also guided the literature search and inventory and classification of early studies and served as predictors for future studies. The results of this study are discussed based on the trends and future directions of the research and development of seed orchards. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The forest carbon market in Brazil presents a complex scenario filled with challenges and opportunities. This study employed SWOT analysis to evaluate the dynamics of this market, based on the perceptions of 77 specialists from various professional fields. The analysis revealed that extensive forest cover and biodiversity preservation are significant strengths that position Brazil as a potential leader in the global carbon credit market. However, weaknesses such as illegal deforestation and fragile public policies undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Opportunities include the growing international demand for carbon credits and the recognition of the importance of local communities in forest conservation. Nevertheless, external threats like land conflicts and political instability pose considerable risks. The study concludes that it is crucial to strengthen public policies and regulatory frameworks, promote technological innovation, and ensure the active inclusion of local and indigenous communities to guarantee the sustainability and growth of Brazil’s forest carbon market. The research suggests that despite significant challenges, Brazil can overcome these obstacles with the implementation of effective strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This research aimed to select conilon coffee tree clones (Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner) for agroforestry and/or intercropping systems. The experiment was carried out at Bananal do Norte Experimental Farm (20º45' S and 41º17' W), Espírito Santo, Brazil. The clones were evaluated in an agroforestry system with “urograndis” hybrid eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus grandis W.Hill × E. urophylla S.T.Blake) plus prata-type banana herbs (Musa spp.) and an intercropping with ‘Folha Murcha’ sweet orange trees (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck). An augmented block experiment design, with two plants per plot, four controls, in six blocks in the agroforestry system and four in the intercropping, was adopted. Thirteen morphophysiological characteristics were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using the restricted maximum likelihood method and best linear unbiased prediction and the significance of genetic effects by the likelihood ratio test. To select superior clones the Mulamba-Rank index was performed. Twenty clones were selected for the agroforestry and 20 for the intercropped system. The clones 16, 17, 35, 43, 48, 61, 64, 68 and T3 were the most promising for both systems. There is genetic variability to be explored among the clones, being possible the development of varieties, in the future, for agroforestry and intercropping systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Soil fertility depletion is a major constraint to agricultural production in the Congo Basin and is aggravated by climate change. Therefore, agroforestry systems (AFS) are used to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. Indeed, Pentaclethra macrophylla and Acacia auriculiformis are among the most agroforestry species used in this basin. However, smallholders are limited in their choice of agroforestry species and the spacing. Hence, this study comparatively evaluated the effects of P. macrophylla (native) and A. auriculiformis (exotic) legume tree species on soil macronutrients and food crops’ yield during four cropping seasons. To do this, a multifactor trial design was implemented in Lobilo catchment, Congo Basin, with two tree species, four tree planting densities (T1: 2500 trees × ha−1, T2: 625 trees × ha−1, T3: 278 trees × ha−1; and T0: crop monoculture), and three intercrops (cassava, maize, and peanut). The results revealed that both agroforestry species did not significantly differ regarding their impact on soil macronutrients. The total nitrogen and the pH in soil have increased with the cropping seasons. With regard to the food crops, cassava and maize yield were greater under P. macrophylla than under A. auriculiformis. However, the 2500 trees × ha−1 density negatively affected food crops’ yield and did not allow food crop production after the second cropping season. To maximize the positive effects of these AFS, it is essential to plant or co-plant these two agroforestry species at 625 trees × ha−1 density. Future research could investigate other native species and include water and light interactions. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Context: On pioneer fronts, the new spatial-temporal evolution of agriculture needs to be understood to help farmers find their way to conciliate food production and forest conservation. Analyzing farm trajectories is consequently critical for designing such futures and to assess their commitments with agroecology principles. Objective: Based on the analysis of the literature on farm trajectories and pathways we proposed a renewed analytical framework to analyze farm trajectories in pioneer fronts and support the identification of desirable strategies for the future. Methods: A systematic review adapted from the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was used. From an initial record of 246 papers, 81 were selected as eligible for the review. The articles were classified in six categories according to three criteria: i) the retrospective or prospective analysis of farm trajectories, ii) the consideration or not of the territorial scale (drawing lessons at territorial scale), iii) the use or not of modeling tools. We also explored whether off-farm factors (such as existing infrastructure at territorial scale or access to credit) and intra-farm factors (such as the organization of family work and the role of women within this organization) were considered since these factors affect farms trajectories in pioneer fronts. Results and conclusions: Results indicate that the concept of trajectory is mainly associated with retrospective analyses while the concept of pathway is mostly associated with prospective studies generally using simulation tools for the design of future scenarios. The link between trajectories and agroecological principles also has been little explored in the literature. Both retrospective and prospective studies fail to pay sufficient attention to the roles of women and family organization. Lastly, most of the methodologies studied do not fully consider the effects of off-farm territorial factors and public policies on these trajectories. We propose an analytical framework that would address these limitations. Significance: This framework is currently used in Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and will help defining sustainable farm trajectories limiting deforestation. Such a framework is needed to support farm development on pioneer fronts and broadly in territories that must deal with highly critical environmental agendas. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Forests in Brazil play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and the environment, but this has been threatened by deforestation, forest fires, and the effects of climate change. Among these, forest fire has happened frequently in areas where there have been changes in land use for activities of agriculture and livestock farming, that motivate the destruction of forests particularly in biomes like the Amazon and Cerrado. In those biomes, the forest fires initiated to clear land for pasture are the most worrying because promote ecological and socioeconomic consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and impacts the regional flora and biogeochemical cycles. As a strategy to understand and identify areas at risk of forest fires, this study aimed to develop a risk zoning framework for fire hotspots in the biomes of Brazilians. This framework combines multiple variables, incorporating factors like physical terrain, land use, and climatic data, to assess the potential fire risk. The areas with greater fire risk are located in the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, in which the physical and climate variables influence directly in incidence and propagation of fire. In the Amazon biome there is a fire risk, some possibly intentional, but can be regulated by elevated precipitation in the region. The identification of areas at high fire risk allows the implementation of proactive strategies for fire prevention for safeguarding Brazil’s biomes and ecosystems, which are integral to the environment and biodiversity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Microbial biomass (MB) is an important indicator of soil quality, being responsive to changes resulting from soil management and use. Although there are studies that evaluate changes in soil microbiological attributes in coffee growing systems, the effects of these systems on MB and its relationship with other soil attributes have rarely been investigated, especially in tropical climate conditions at altitude. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different coffee growing systems on biomass and microbial activity and how these responses relate to other soil and litter attributes. Our study was carried out in soils under three Coffea arabica cultivation systems (CCM—monoculture, CCB—consortium with banana, AFS—agroforestry system with Grevillea robusta) and under native forest (NF). Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0–10 cm and subjected to analysis to determine the microbial biomass carbon content (MB-C) by the fumigation-extraction method, accumulated respiration through released CO2, soil organic carbon (SOC) and labile carbon by wet oxidation. There was a 45% reduction in SOC in coffee growing systems and a 75% reduction in MB-C in CCM compared to NF. The AFS is closer to native forest conditions due to its positive influence on the SOC content and the efficiency of converting this carbon into microbial carbon. The presence of the forestry component is positive and should be encouraged to mitigate the impacts of coffee growing on the soil. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the endogenous variable, lowcarbon development, and valuate its influencing factors, given its pivotal role in environmental protection amid climate change concerns and economic growth. Low carbon development is a new platform to maintain economic growth through reducing carbon emissions and reducing the use of natural resources, because it was predicted that reducing emissions will increase economic growth while preventing forest loss, improving air quality and living standards, and reducing mortality rates. METHODS: Utilizing a quantitative method, this study integrates a novel viewpoint by combining low-carbon development with related emission factors. The study utilizes secondary data, specifically time series data spanning 31 years from 1991 to 2021, which were analyzed using regression study methods. The factors being examined include capital formation, deforestation, land transportation, agricultural land, and industrialization. FINDINGS: Findings reveal that low-carbon development in North Sumatra is influenced significantly by capital formation, deforestation, agricultural land, and industrialization, with land transportation showing no substantial impact. Capital formation has a favorable impact on low-carbon development. But, deforestation, land transportation, agricultural land and industrialization have a negative impact on low-carbon development. Together, these determinants account for 77.55 percent of the variance. Capital formation contributes 19.8 percent, deforestation 15.6 percent, agricultural land 19.0 percent, and industrialization 18.9 percent to low-carbon development. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis established in this study is accepted. To foster low-carbon development in North Sumatra, specific attention is required from local governments. Capital formation is vital. Measures include controlling interest rates, supporting businesses, fostering an investment-friendly climate, ensuring security, and integrating environmental sustainability considerations into project implementation to curb carbon emissions. Prevention of deforestation involves tightening land clearance licenses and enhancing institutional quality through environmental protection and property rights legislation. The government must strive for promoting eco-friendly agricultural practices with mitigated through outreach programs involving experts who educate farmers on minimizing emissions, reducing carbon emissions from pesticide with using biochar sourced from empty palm fruit bunches and also rice straw which is very easy to obtain at a low cost and is environmentally friendly, and emphasizing environmental preservation policies in the industrial sector like industrial transformation efforts with an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions such as restructuring various aspects of industrial activities, including investment, final demand, intensity and production methods. The implementation of tax emissions and strategic interventions increases the likelihood of realizing low-carbon development in North Sumatra, aligning with sustainable development goals. © (2024) GJESM Publication.

AB  - Global warming, fueled by rising CO2 levels, threatens life on earth. Mangrove ecosystems, with their high CO2 absorption capacity, are crucial in climate mitigation efforts. This study aims to identify the attributes of mangrove biomass, quantify carbon stock, and assess the capacity of above-ground biomass (including trees, saplings, and seedlings) and soil to sequester carbon. Carbon stock measurements were conducted in the Baluno Mangrove Forest conservation area which is under the management of the Yayasan Peduli Pengembangan Masyarakat Desa (YPPMD). The sampling strategy employed was stratified proportionate random sampling. The research area is partitioned into multiple s trata of mangrove forest vegetation density. The study area consists of 25 plots, each measuring 20x20 (400 m2 soil samples are collected using a soil core to a certain depth, typically up to 30 cm or more. The samples are then analyzed in a laboratory to determine the organic carbon content. Therefore, the total area covered by the plots is 10,000 m2, which is equivalent to 1 hectare. The Baluno Mangroves have a total biomass of 1,558.15 tons/ha. The species with the highest biomass was Sonneratia sp., with a value of 30.81 tons. Conversely, the species having the lowest biomass was Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, with a value of 0.0625 tons. The Baluno Mangrove area has an average carbon stock of 989.04 tons per hectare, with the potential to absorb 3,629.79 tons of CO2 per hectare. In conclusion, Baluno Mangroves store 58,719.57 metric tons of carbon, with Sonneratia sp. as the largest contributor, emphasizing the vital role of Indonesia's mangroves in global carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Mangroves, which are vital for maintaining the stability of coastal ecosystems, are facing increasing threats from global changes. This highlights the urgent need for effective adaptive capacity programs. This study focuses on the evaluation of such programs within Taman Nasional Bali Barat, Indonesia, specifically looking at their effectiveness in promoting sustainable mangrove conservation. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the community's involvement and perspectives, a survey was conducted, including a wide range of local stakeholders, not just those already involved in conservation efforts. The findings revealed that programs that prioritize flexibility, learning, and agency are crucial, but are currently underperforming. Interestingly, there was a significant variation in the willingness to participate among different groups. Fishermen and students displayed negative tendencies, while limited interest communities (a population segment historically less engaged in conservation), those with previous experiences with conservation programs, those seeking advice on marine activities, and those influenced by policies showed positive and significant responses. For example, tourist operators also exhibited a significantly positive engagement. Based on the analysis, this study provides targeted policy recommendations to enhance stakeholder engagement, improve program flexibility, and emphasize educational efforts. These recommendations aim to strengthen the adaptive capacity for sustainable mangrove management in the face of ongoing global changes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The landslide that occurred on January 24, 2019, became the largest landslide in history in the Jenelata sub-watershed. This study aims to determine mitigation priorities by analyzing the characteristics of landscape escape around landslide-prone areas in the Jenelata Sub-watershed, Jeneberang Watershed. After learning the characteristics of landscape-lifescape, a spatial-AHP analysis was carried out to assess which programs are suitable for implementation in the Jenelata Sub Watershed, Jeneberang Watershed. On the basis on the results of the spatial-AHP analysis, the agroforestry system is a mitigation direction that can be carried out near all villages in the Jenelata Sub Watershed, with an area of 9788 hectares or 42% of the total area of the Jenelata Sub Watershed. In addition, agroforestry can promote soil and water conservation, with 382 hectares (2%), and protection, with 886 hectares or 4% of the total area of the Jenelata Sub Watershed. In addition, a merger can be made between each mitigation directive of 2444 hectares, or 11% of the total area of the Jenelata Sub Watershed, which can be adjusted to land needs, and the remaining 9424 hectares (41%) are unsuitable for mitigation activities. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded. Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025-1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105-288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671-373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling. This new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, which is likely to vary spatially across the Amazon basin. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The present systematic literature review (SLR) synthesized the literature on mangrove litterfall production and decomposition from studies published between 1985 and 2023 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Key questions about biophysical, chemical, and anthropogenic/societal factors influencing nutrient cycling via litterfall production and decomposition in mangrove forests were addressed. The SLR included 332 peer-reviewed original and review articles from the ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The United States of America had the highest relative count (RC, 31.32%), followed by Japan (8.79%) and Indonesia (8.24%), and the lowest RCs were found in Bangladesh, Kenya, Philippines, and Thailand. We showed the increasing trend on these topics and discussed the milestones to enhance our understanding of litterfall production and decomposition processes and inform future research endeavors in the context of climate change. A positive trajectory for understanding litterfall production and decomposition for effective decision-making and management strategies towards mangrove conservation and sustainable use is also discussed. Ten-year research prospects were also identified, including studies on impacts of pollution, habitat degradation, climate change, and other destructive human activities. The trend in studies about mangrove litterfall production and decomposition suggests the growing recognition of mangroves’ ecological and societal importance. Future advancements can be made to better understand the biophysical, chemical, and anthropogenic factors influencing litterfall production and decomposition through the identified future research directions. Finally, the findings of the present review are relevant to supporting effective conservation and management strategies for mangroves in a changing climate. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - The importance and vulnerability of municipalities in the eastern Amazon led to the evaluation of the distribution of seasonal precipitation and extreme events over protected and deforested sites along the Carajás Railroad (EFC) based on three datasets: Brazilian Daily Weather Gridded Data (BR-DWGD), European Reanalysis (ERA5-Land), and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS). The main purpose is the understanding of the relationship between local land use change and the occurrence of extreme climate events. Results suggested that large-scale deforestation has a regional impact occasionally outweighing local effect. Significant trends reveal a general pattern of drought that has been more intense in the north of the study area, regardless of land cover, whether preserved or deforested. Moreover, the dry season is getting drier, but the wet season is not getting wetter over the entire area, as Carajás National Forest and Curionópolis (southern sector) deliver positive and accentuated trends in the rainy season. Extreme events are becoming more frequent. The number of consecutive dry days has increased in the north revealing an extension of dry periods, whereas, the maximum one-day precipitation has soared in the south indicating the intensification of rainfall. CHIRPS provides stronger correlations with the standard dataset (BR-DWGD), as both furnish primary data based on rain gauges observations. It also outperforms ERA5-Land in annual and seasonal analyses, which does not invalidate the latter as a great alternative to use in data-poor locations. Ultimately, further research and technology implementation were recommended to improve reforestation efforts given the reported results. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The intensification of agricultural systems (e.g., vegetable production) to supply the food demand of the world's population has increased over the last decades. In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (ρ), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in ρ and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change, but can be very costly. This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agriculture is an essential economic activity in Brazil. However, it is also the main source of water quality degradation. Monitoring catchments with agricultural land use is a way to generate information on a scale to identify causes and sources of water quality degradation. This work used monitoring data derived from hydrology and the quality of surface and underground water in an intensive agricultural catchment in the Atlantic Forest biome. The Fortaleza River catchment is located in the western part of Santa Catarina state in southern Brazil and has 62 km2 of drainage area. Hydrological and water quality monitoring was conducted for 7 years at two fluviometric stations, three lysimeters, one meteorological station, and one piezometer. Data on precipitation, temperature, water flow, surface runoff, drainage, and water quality were used. Statistical analyses were also developed. Precipitation between 2013 and 2019 presented a homogeneous distribution in monthly and annual data, with January and July the months with the highest and lowest values, respectively. Statistical difference in the average and Q95 flows was found in upstream and downstream fluviometric sections. In terms of quality, statistical differences were identified for ammonium, nitrate, and potassium concentrations, which had higher concentrations in lysimeter runoff, indicating direct influence of agricultural activity on water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that (i) surface water presented a positive relationship in Component 1 for the magnesium-calcium, sulphate-chloride, and acetate-bromide groups and a negative relationship for phosphate-nitrate; (ii) in lysimeters, the positive relationship occurred for Component 2 for the phosphate-chloride and sulphate-nitrate groups and was negative for ammonium-lithium and calcium-potassium-magnesium; and (iii) in piezometer, positive relationships were found for chloride-sodium and phosphate-nitrite pairs, while negative relationships were found for calcium-magnesium. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The conservation of forest remnants in southern Brazil is closely related to historical land use, for example in systems such as caívas that occur within remnants of the Araucaria Forest and include livestock production and the extraction of yerba mate. Over the last decade, technologies adapted for these systems have been developed that promote a significant increase in animal productivity, without harming forest regeneration or the maintenance of the tree layer. However, the fertilization of pastures proposed in the technology has also promoted greater growth of native trees, with a consequent increase in shade levels. This, in turn, has affected the maintenance of pasture and yerba mate in the understory. Thus, this study sought to develop a methodology to adjust shade levels based on forest management that adheres to the limits permitted by current legislation. The objective was to evaluate the effect of tree management to maintain 50% shade levels on environmental indicators in a caíva that has been implementing pasture improvement technology since 2013. Native tree management occurred in 2020 and 2022 and the results were compared with data from the floristic survey of the area carried out in 2013. The results indicate that although the adoption of forest management to adjust shade levels reduced the density of individuals, it did not affect forest diversity, nor the basal area of the caíva tree layer. As such, it is possible to maintain pasture and yerba mate production in the area. Strategies like this are fundamental so that the forest landscape can continue to offer a source of production while also supporting environmental conservation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest Biome (AFB) creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes, such as Haemagogus and Sabethes species, which transmit the Yellow Fever virus (YFV) to both human and non-human primates (NHP) (particularly Alouatta sp. and Callithrix sp.). From 2016 to 2020, 748 fatal cases of YF in humans and 1,763 in NHPs were reported in this biome, following several years free from the disease. This underscores the imminent risk posed by the YFV. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of YF cases in both NHPs and humans across the entire AFB during the outbreak period, using a generalized linear mixed regression model (GLMM) at the municipal level. Our analysis examined factors associated with the spread of YFV, including environmental characteristics, climate conditions, human vaccination coverage, and the presence of two additional YFV-affected NHP species. The occurrence of epizootics has been directly associated with natural forest formations and the presence of species within the Callithrix genus. Additionally, epizootics have been shown to be directly associated with human prevalence. Furthermore, human prevalence showed an inverse correlation with urban areas, temporary croplands, and savannah and grassland areas. Further analyses using Moran’s Index to incorporate the neighborhoods of municipalities with cases in each studied host revealed additional variables, such as altitude, which showed a positive correlation. Additionally, the occurrence of the disease in both hosts exhibited a spatio-temporal distribution pattern. To effectively mitigate the spread of the virus, it is necessary to proactively expand vaccination coverage, refine NHP surveillance strategies, and enhance entomological surveillance in both natural and modified environments.

AB  - The susceptibility to climate change concerns the coffee market worldwide due to possible severe productivity losses. Brazil is the world's largest Arabica coffee producer and has crops in regions considered persistent climate change hotspots. Our study analyzed risks, vulnerabilities, and susceptibilities to pests and diseases in these regions under current and future climates and outlined adaptive measures to reduce future vulnerabilities. Ten risk indicators based on Arabica coffee requirements were proposed: water supply (Iw), base (TIB) and maximum temperature stresses (TImax), which delimit the temperature range where Arabica coffee grows and productivity is penalized outside both ranges, frost stress (TIfrost), diseases such as rust (DIrust), brown eye spot (DIbrown), and Phoma leaf spot (DIphoma), pests such as coffee berry borer (PIberry), coffee leaf miner (PIminer), and yield loss due to water stress (Iyg). Daily near-surface air temperature (minimum, mean, and maximum), relative humidity, precipitation, and global solar radiation were used from 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP), which are derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585). All risk indicators were calculated for the current climate (1995–2014) and projected for the near (2041–2060), intermediate (2061–2080), and far future (2081–2100) in three SSPs and then classified into five risk classes (very low, low, moderate, high and very high). Our results indicated that due to increases in TImax and Iyg indicators, with high to very high risk in area and magnitude, Arabica coffee plantations will be negatively affected and economically unfeasible for about 35 % to 75 % of the studied area throughout the 21st century. Furthermore, the rust and the leaf miner will remain a concern in future climates due to increased temperatures and reduced relative humidity. The future of Arabica coffee crops in Brazil will depend on adopting effective adaptive measures and prudent agricultural strategies to address anticipated risks, including shifting crops to higher altitude areas, introducing more climate-resilient coffee cultivars/varieties, using agroforestry or intercropping systems, planting in closer spacing or higher density planting, and employing dripper or partial root-zone irrigation techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies related to monitoring changes in frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation extremes are key to creating efficient climate change measures and forest conservation policies. This study describes new insights into rainfall precipitation extremes over the Amazon basin (AB) during the last four decades (1981–2021) from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPSv2). Here we analysed the trends of daily extreme precipitation indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) at the seasonal scale, using the trend-empirical orthogonal function (TEOF). Our results indicate that the frequency of precipitation extremes increased over Peruvian Amazonia and northeastern Brazilian Amazonia, and reduced in the centre of AB, mainly during the first seasons of the year: December–January–February (DJF) and March–April–May (MAM). The cooling trend over the eastern and central tropical Pacific and the warming trend over the tropical and western subtropical Pacific could associate with the increase in frequency of precipitation extremes in DJF. Furthermore, during June–July–August (JJA) and September–October–November (SON), rainfall intensity indices showed a decrease in Colombia and the Bolivian Amazon; in contrast, northern and southern Peru delivered an increased pattern. The trend pattern in the JJA and SON seasons could be associated with a warming trend over most of the North Atlantic and a cooling in the 40°–60° S band. Our results demonstrate that the precipitation extremes over the AB have spatially varying trends. These heterogeneous trends over the space might be take into account for robust adaptation policies over the countries that are parts of the AB, such as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Perú, Surinam and Venezuela. © 2024 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB  - Erosion is a worldwide threat to biodiversity conservation and agricultural yield, and it is linked to deforestation. In this study, we aim to assess soil loss in landscapes of Cachoeira River watershed, in southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil. We estimate the role of forests in dimin-ishing soil erosion using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). We compare real and simulated scenarios in which the forest was replaced by agricultural use, also comparing estimates of erosivity factor (R factor) derived from remote sensing and climatological station data. Real and simulated annual soil losses varied from 0 to 15.95 t/year and from 0 to 33.53 t/year along the watershed, respectively. How-ever, only 0.04 and 1.67% of this area is highly and severely exposed to erosion, using data from climatological stations and remote sensing, respectively. Soil loss in the simulated deforested scenario was approximately two times higher than the real annual soil loss, indicating the importance of forest cover to mitigate soil erosion. Moreover, soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. Conclusively, the practice of agroforestry can be used as an alternative to avoid erosion. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Mangroves in Southeast Asia provide numerous supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that are crucial to the environment and local livelihoods since they support biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits. © 2024

AB  - The processes of occupation and exploitation in the Amazon have been increasing, and as a consequence, forest areas are being replaced by agroecosystems. As a consequence of this change, changes have been occurring in the soil attributes, and consequently, in the stability of aggregates in these environments. Thus, this work had two objectives: the first was to evaluate the impacts generated by the conversion of forests into agroecosystems on the soil attributes that are related to aggregates, in the southwestern region of the Amazon; the second objective was to evaluate the roles of pedophysical and pedochemical parameters on the stability of soil aggregates. The study was carried out on rural properties located in the southern part of Amazonas State, Brazil. Eight areas under different agroecosystems were selected: in the municipality of Canutama: (i) annatto, (ii) guarana, and (iii) cupuassu; in the municipality of Humaitá: (iv) cassava, (v) agroforestry, and (vi) sugarcane; and in the municipality of Manicoré: (vii) pasture and (viii) native forest. Unformed soil samples were collected from the 0.00–0.10 m layer and analyzed for aggregate stability, bulk density, soil organic carbon, and soil organic carbon stock. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. The largest soil aggregations occurred in the annatto, guarana, sugarcane, and pasture agroecosystems. We associate the greater aggregation capacity of soils with factors that are inherent to the cultivated species and soil properties. The first factor corresponds to the adaptability of the Amazonian and grass species and their ability to produce biomass. The second factor is related to the physical and chemical properties of Amazonian soils, largely influenced by the sand fraction, soil organic carbon, soil acidity, and availability of exchangeable Ca and Mg. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The implementation of degraded land rehabilitation programs and community-based forest management certification is widely recognised to enhance the status of wono land cover and aid in climate change mitigation. The expansion of the restoration efforts can be monitored using satellite images to track the progress of operations by observing changes in land cover area. Community forest certification also can enhance the success of land restoration endeavours. Therefore, this study aimed to show the change in forest land cover and the amount of carbon stored from 1972 to 2021. Landsat imagery was used to depict land cover conditions in 1972, 1982, 1993, 2000, 2008, 2014, and 2021, before and after the implementation of restoration and community forest certification programs. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index approach was employed for satellite images captured in 1972 and 1982, while the Forest Canopy Density method was employed for images in 1993, 2000, 2008, 2014, and 2021, to illustrate the progressive increase in wono land cover. Meanwhile, carbon storage was analysed from 1972 to 2021 using national carbon storage conversion. The results indicated that restoration activity and the establishment of community forest certification increased wono area and carbon storage, which totalled 55.90 ha and 5,499.04 t C between 1972 and 2021. Augmenting carbon storage within wono land cover constituted an effective strategy for mitigating climate change. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Taman Wisata Alam Mangrove (TWAM) is a mangrove conservation area located in North Jakarta, Indonesia, and its existence is very important due to its various ecological benefits that ensure the sustainability of the coastal area. Recently, mangroves have been recognized for their significant carbon sequestration capabilities, thereby contributing significantly to climate change mitigation efforts. This study aims to map mangrove cover, estimate biomass and carbon stock in TWAM mangrove. TWAM mangroves were mapped using consumer-grade drones and freely available satellite imagery. In addition, a high-accuracy positioning is carried out to improve and assess the accuracy of the mangrove cover map. An allometric equation is used to estimate the aboveground biomass which can then be converted into carbon stock. The study results showed that the height of the mangrove canopy in TWAM was 8.77 ± 4.05 m, while mangrove cover showed an increase over the last 10 years with an average rate of about 2.9 ha/year. The mangrove ecosystem at the study site has been estimated to have aboveground biomass and carbon stock of 129.70 tons/ha and 64.85 tons/ha, respectively. The study results show that mangrove cover and its potential carbon stock are increasing, indicating the importance of designated conservation areas in mangrove rehabilitation efforts. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia, essential for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are under severe threat from deforestation. This article emphasizes their significance and their role in Indonesia's climate change mitigation strategies. Their carbon sequestration capacity is substantial, potentially preventing significant CO2 emissions. Indonesia is committed to climate change mitigation, with its Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution focusing on the Forest and Other Land Use (folu) sector, where mangroves are pivotal. However, optimizing this potential and involving local communities present challenges due to weak enforcement, policy conflicts, and limited community engagement. Based on a case study in South Sumatra, this study highlights the importance of involving local governments and communities in mangrove conservation efforts as a climate change mitigation measure. By applying a jurisdictional approach, especially through social-forestry schemes (e.g. Village Forests and mangrove-based ecotourism), local governments can play a crucial role in preserving mangrove ecosystems, integrating them into climate policies, and supporting community empowerment while achieving climate change mitigation goals. © Edwin Martin et al., 2024.

AB  - Indonesia has the largest tropical peatlands in the Asia-Pacific region and the world’s second largest tropical peatlands. Growing concerns on peatland conservation and restoration emphasise the importance of these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Although Indonesia’s peatlands are well-studied compared with other tropical countries, there are still uncertainties regarding its peat volume and carbon stock estimations, and how important it is locally and globally. To solve these uncertainties, this study estimated peat volume and carbon stock in Indonesia using the national peatlands data published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Republic of Indonesia and analysed greenhouse gas emissions among the major industrial sectors in the country and global emissions by peatland degradation. Our study posited that anthropogenic disturbance degraded Indonesian peatlands and that the country could become the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Therefore, successful conservation and restoration of Indonesia’s peatlands could significantly contribute to global climate change mitigation and adaptation. ©Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Forests are currently faced with the challenge of increasingly widespread forest degradation, threatening human life at the global level due to climate change and unexpected plans. In this context, the role of local knowledge is considered strategic in sustainable forest management. In line with the dynamics of global change, local knowledge often needs to be adapted, complemented, or preserved to continue contributing to forestry development. Similarly, in the case of forests in Indonesia, climate change can influence local knowledge of forest management. Consequently, there is a need for studies on how communities adapt their traditional practices to climate change and the impact of such adaptations on the sustainability of forest resources. Through a qualitative method with case studies, this research was conducted to identify and understand local community knowledge and its role in forest management. The research was conducted in Wonokerto Village, Rembang Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Data was collected from January-October 2023 using observation and interview techniques involving 21 informants from Forest Village Community Institutions (LMDH) representatives, forest farmers, facilitators, forest police, Perhutani, and local community leaders. The interactive model analyses data through data collection, reduction, verification, and presentation. Research shows local knowledge of forest communities emerging from various values and norms, cultural rituals, forest management practices, and local institutions. As a result, this local knowledge positively contributes to forest sustainability, where a balanced relationship between society and the forest is well maintained.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - There are high expectations about the role of active reforestation in mitigating climate change, by means of carbon sequestration and storage, fueling the carbon credit market. Carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or, at best, the expected size and wood density of planted trees. However, the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear, since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old, thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic, multifactor restoration outcome. We used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation in 30 Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites sharing the same climate, soil type, and restoration technique. We evaluated the entire age range of 1–19 years, and three age intervals, 1–3 years, 4–8 years, and over 9 years. AGB, basal area, and tree density increased considering all ages (1–19 years). Our results showed, however, that the AGB, tree density, and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years. Adjusted model r2 values decreased with time, suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural, uncontrolled, and, to some extent, unknown factors. Although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of long-term carbon stocks based on tree planting, high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Tectona grandis L. (teak) is one of the cherished heritage tropical hardwood species that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a large deciduous tree native to India, Myanmar and Thailand. The natural populations of teak remain an important source from the economic, ecological and environmental perspectives. Teak timber is well known for its quality in terms of durability and market value. It is naturally resistant to various biotic stress components due to the presence of tectoquinone, lapachol and deoxy lapachol; however, it takes a minimum of 20–25 years for the production of marketable wood to fetch high returns. This long haul provides sufficient time for pests and diseases to feast upon teak at various growth stages starting from nursery to timber mills which leads to a downturn in timber production. To meet the rising demand from wood industries, it is essential to manage the health of the teak plantation outside forests. The reports of new pests and diseases on teak escalated since 2010, especially from countries like Brazil and Mexico where we witness recent rise in commercial teak forests, and this vulnerability emphasizes the deployment of protection measures right from the supply of quality planting material. The update on the biotic factors comprising insect pests, fungal and bacterial infections, which are currently limiting teak wood production, will supplement the efforts involved in quality planting material production. Identification of plus trees with genetic resistance, molecular characterization and monitoring of pests and diseases on teak harnessing the recent developments in plant protection, along with the research on development of the package of practices for teak nurseries and plantation management, will only sustain teak production in near future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft.

AB  - Local Agroforestry Practices (LAPs) in the Papua Region, Indonesia, which are still under-researched, play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation through sustainable crop rotation systems, intensification, and technological adaptability. This research aims to develop an improved intensification model that integrates these LAPs with sustainable agroforestry practices, biodiversity conservation, food security measures, and adaptive responses to climate change and extreme conditions. The study utilized the Focus Group Discussion (FGD) method, demonstration plot, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) type selection of LAPs, and economic and allometric equations. The findings revealed a meticulous species selection process that considered biodiversity, resulting in 24 species classified as Least Concern (LC), 2 species classified as Near Threatened (NT), 1 species classified as Vulnerable (VU), and 2 species classified as Endangered (EN). The LAPs implementation achieved a Food Security (FS) score of 45,23% and 38.47% for Only Used (OU). Importantly, the total revenue generated by the LAPs design in Moswaren, Aimas, and Manokwari Village is nearly the same, with an average of Rp 16,327,231.00, Rp 16,640,731.00 and Rp 15,848,675.00 per year, respectively. This represents a significant economic impact, with the increase being 2.93-5.04 times greater than typical LAPs; this significant contribution to biodiversity conservation is a testament to their value. The aggregate carbon content across the three sites varied between 223.80 and 279.05 tC/ha. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) can deliver many benefits to human wellbeing, including some crucial to climate adaptation. We quantitatively assess the global potential of NBS strategies of protection, restoration, and agroforestry by modeling global climate change mitigation and local ecosystem services (water availability, sediment retention, runoff, pollination, nitrogen retention, green water storage, and coastal protection). The strategies with the most potential to help people do not necessarily deliver the most climate change mitigation: per area of conservation action, agroforestry provides substantial benefits (>20% increase in at least one local ecosystem service) to three times more people on average than reforestation while providing less than one tenth the carbon sequestration per unit area. Each strategy delivers a different suite of ecosystem service benefits; for instance, avoided forest conversion provides a strong increase in nitrogen retention (100% increase to 72 million people if fully implemented globally) while agroforestry increases pollination services (100% increase to 3.0 billion people if fully implemented globally). One common disservice shared by all the NBS strategies modeled here is that increased woody biomass increases transpiration, reducing annual runoff and in some watersheds negatively impacting local water availability. In addition, the places with the greatest potential for climate change mitigation are not necessarily the ones with the most people. For instance, reforestation in Latin America has the greatest climate change mitigation potential, but the greatest ecosystem service benefits are in Africa. Focusing on nations with high climate mitigation potential as well as high local ecosystem service potential, such as Nigeria in the case of reforestation, India for agroforestry, and the Republic of Congo for avoided forest conversion, can help identify win-win sites for implementation. We find that concentrating implementation of these three conservation strategies in critical places, covering 5.8 million km2, could benefit 2.0 billion people with increased local ecosystem services provision. These critical places cover only 35% of the possible area of implementation but would provide 80% of the benefits that are possible globally for the selected set of ecosystem services under the NBS scenarios examined here. We conclude that targeting these critical places for protection, restoration, and agroforestry interventions will be key to achieving adaptation and human wellbeing goals while also increasing nature-based carbon mitigation.

AB  - The high irrigation water demand of coconut trees in semiarid regions makes rational use crucial for crop sustainability. Additionally, it produces residues that could improve the soil water holding capacity. This research aimed to evaluate the application of coconut shell biochar to an irrigated dwarf green coconut palm orchard. The study was carried out from January 2019 to December 2021 at Campo Experimental do Curu, Paraipaba, Brazil, belonging to Embrapa Agroindústria Tropical. The experiment consisted of a completely randomized design with five treatments and four replications and included the application of 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 g of biochar per kg of soil, equivalent to 0.0 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.0 kg or 4.0 kg of biochar per plant, respectively. The following biometric variables were evaluated: number of leaves per plant (NL), plant height (PH), number of leaflets per leaf (LFT), canopy diameter (CD) and fruit production: number of bunches per plant (NB), number of fruits per plant (NF), volume of coconut water per fruit (CWF) and total soluble solids (TSS) (°Brix), as well as the daily soil moisture average. The results showed beneficial effects on the number of leaves per plant, fruits per plant, soil moisture and irrigation water productivity in terms of liters per fruit, liters per coconut water and fruits per cubic meter (m3) applied with ideal biochar doses estimated to be 1.40 kg, 1.72 kg, 1.79 kg, 1.56 kg, 1.48 and 1.68 kg of biochar per plant, respectively. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in coastal areas from an ecological perspective, being able to store large amounts of carbon through sequestration and inhibiting climate change processes by absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere. In recent years, there have been changes in the land cover of converted and degraded mangrove forests which have resulted in the release of carbon and an imbalance in soil structure, which in turn cause a flux of CO2 into the atmosphere. This research was conducted at the Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study focused on six different land covers, namely natural forests, restoration, mixed agriculture, paddy fields, oil palm plantation, and ponds. This study aimed to measure the total carbon stock of mangrove forests that have been converted to other land covers and estimate the level of CO2 flux in the area. A total of three transects and six plots for each land cover were used in this study; for tree biomass, a non-destructive method was used by recording every DBH > 5 cm, and for soil carbon, drilling was carried out, which was divided into five depths in each plot. CO2 flux was measured using an Eosense Eosgp CO2 sensor with the static closed chamber method. The highest carbon stock was found at 308.09 Mg ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 3.22 Mg ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture. The highest soil carbon was found at 423.59 MgC ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 50.44 MgC ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture dry land. The highest average CO2 flux value of 1362.24 mgCO2 m2 h−1 was found in mangrove restoration and the lowest in ponds was 123.03 mgCO2 m2 h−1. Overall, the research results inform how much carbon stock is lost when converted to other land covers so that it can be used as a reference for policy makers to provide future management of mangrove forests and develop mitigation measurements to reduce carbon emissions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Euterpe edulis is an endangered palm species that provides the most important non-timber forest product exploited in its natural habitat, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot1,4. From 1991 to 2017, pasturelands, agriculture, and monoculture of tree plantations were responsible for 97% of Atlantic Forest deforested areas in Brazil and Santa Catarina was one of the Brazilian states with the greatest loss of forest area14. In the last decade, E. edulis fruits reached their highest commercial value, producing the southeastern equivalent of Amazonian ‘‘açai’’ (Euterpe oleracea)5,7,8. As a shade-tolerant species, E. edulis adapts very well to agroforestry systems8,10. To evaluate potential areas for cultivation of E. edulis through agroforestry systems, we developed and applied a spatial model for mapping suitable areas. To accomplish this, we analyzed multisource biophysical data and E. edulis distribution data from the Forest Inventory of Santa Catarina. We identified two areas with potential occurrence of the species, one in the domains of coastal Dense Ombrophilous Forest where the species is more common and another in the domains of inland Deciduous Seasonal Forest where its occurrence was suspected, but not proven, until 2021. Today, Deciduous Seasonal Forest is the most fragmented and impacted by agriculture. Our model, together with confirmed areas of occurrence, indicates that deciduous seasonal forest region should be prioritized for production and recovery of E. edulis through agroforestry systems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Smallholder farmers and their agroecosystems in active volcanic landscapes need to deal with and recover from eruptions. Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social–ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species’ survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer’s adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and assesses the progress on the effects of Indonesia’s REDD+ program. Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project’s implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups’ interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Smart agriculture systems are models that offer significant potential to improve farming practices by providing advanced tools for land analysis, plant monitoring, weed management, and produce estimation. Many small-scale farmers, particularly in major agricultural regions such as East Java, Indonesia, continue to rely on inefficient traditional methods. Therefore, this research aimed to introduce the Smart Agriculture Ontology System, an innovative framework that incorporates computer vision, deep learning, and semantic web technologies to manage agricultural knowledge effectively. The system integrated traditional observational data with sensor data into a unified knowledge graph, accessible via a query language designed for retrieving and manipulating data stored in the graph. In a case analysis at Puspalebo Orchard, Sidoarjo, East Java, this system provided real-Time recommendations for seed selection, soil management, irrigation, pest control, and post-harvest handling. The results from this research showed that the system improved productivity and efficiency by delivering accurate, data-driven recommendations, making it a valuable tool for modern farming. Moreover, the methodology was designed to be generalizable and applicable to various agricultural contexts, allowing it to be a versatile method for different crops and farming conditions. The potential incorporation of external data sources, such as weather information, demonstrated the adaptability of the system for future agricultural management.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42 ± 16.42; Ni - 5.31 ± 4.3; Mn - 1.64 ± 2.63; Cu - 1.13 ± 1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28 ± 14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34 ± 0.40; Cu - 1 ± 2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66 ± 18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44 ± 9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - A large share of the global forest restoration potential is situated in artificial ‘unstable’ mesic African savannas, which could be restored to higher carbon and biodiversity states if protected from human-induced burning. However, uncertainty on recovery rates in protected unstable savannas impedes science-informed forest restoration initiatives. Here, we quantify the forest restoration success of anthropogenic fire exclusion within an 88-ha mesic artificial savanna patch in the Kongo Central province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). We found that aboveground carbon recovery after 17 years was on average 11.40 ± 0.85 Mg C ha−1. Using a statistical model, we found that aboveground carbon stocks take 112 ± 3 years to recover to 90% of aboveground carbon stocks in old-growth forests. Assuming that this recovery trajectory would be representative for all unstable savannas, we estimate that they could have a total carbon uptake potential of 12.13 ± 2.25 Gt C by 2100 across DR Congo, Congo and Angola. Species richness recovered to 33.17% after 17 years, and we predicted a 90% recovery at 54 ± 2 years. In contrast, we predicted that species composition would recover to 90% of old-growth forest composition only after 124 ± 3 years. We conclude that the relatively simple and cost-efficient measure of fire exclusion in artificial savannas is an effective nature-based solution to climate change and biodiversity loss. However, more long-term and in situ monitoring efforts are needed to quantify variation in long-term carbon and diversity recovery pathways. Particular uncertainties are spatial variability in socio-economics and growing conditions as well as the effects of projected climate change. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This research focuses on developing a multipurpose riparian zone designed to effectively reduce erosion and control nutrient flow into Lake Tondano. The goal is to enhance both conservation and pollution control strategies for sustainable ecosystem management. Conducted at Lake Tondano in Minahasa, Indonesia, the research followed three main stages: data collection, analysis, and design. The data collection included a vegetation survey of riparian species, land use mapping, and measuring nitrogen and phosphorus levels in lake sediments. A total of 91 plant species from 60 genera and 42 families were documented. Based on their Importance Value Index (IVI), non-invasive status, and nutrient absorption capabilities, 15 species were selected for restoration in areas with high nutrient concentrations, with sediment levels recorded at 0.09% nitrogen and 0.06% phosphorus in impacted zones. These plant species were carefully identified and rigorously tested, originating from intact riparian zones. They will be strategically employed in areas facing significant challenges from nutrient overloading. Using QGIS analysis, a riparian zone measuring 100 × 30 m was designed at coordinates 1.1745604 latitude and 124.8972748 longitude, targeting areas most impacted by nutrient pollution, which poses a risk of eutrophication and negatively affects aquatic ecosystems. The multipurpose riparian zone incorporates distinct wet, transition, and dry zones, employing a zigzag planting pattern to optimize pollutant filtration and nutrient uptake. This design effectively addresses critical issues of erosion and nutrient excessive enrichment, promoting ecological health and biodiversity in the region. The novel contributions of this study include identifying specific plant species capable of thriving in nutrient-rich sediments and quantifying their nutrient absorption capacities, thereby providing a scientifically grounded model for similar conservation efforts in vulnerable ecosystems and enhancing overall resilience. However, long-term impacts on water quality require further research to assess nutrient mitigation efficacy. © 2024, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE). All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater organisms in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana) provide direct and indirect benefits to people and the economy of the region. However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region. © 2023, Crown.

AB  - Legume tree One of the crops that may function as a viable source of animal feed and be utilized for land reclamation on former mining sites. Ex-tin mining land, which is widely spread in Indonesia, has the potential to transform to productive agricultural land, as long as the land is given sufficient inputs through land rehabilitation. The legume tree has drought resistance, hence limiting its potential for development on many types of land, including post-tin mining areas in the Bangka Tengah District of Bangka Island. The objective of this research is to assess the adaptation of two legume tree species in post-tin mining environments. The research was completed throughout the period from 2017 to 2020. Experiments using Randomized block design (RBD) with two different species of treatments, were repeated a total of five times. Two species tested were (1) Leucaena leucocephala cv Taramba, and (2) Indigofera zollingeriana. Data growth and yield components are harvested every three months and yield is subjected to analysis using the Duncan test at a significance level of 5 %. The research result indicated that all of the tested two species of legume tree were well-adapted to post-tin mining in Bangka Tengah District, Bangka Island. The fresh yield of L.leucocephala cv Taramba was higher (9.1 %) than I.zollingeriana but the quality was similar, so the two species can be developed on post-tin mining areas as forage material for an animal in Central Bangka District, Bangka Island. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Indonesia has the largest tropical peatland in the world, about 13,43 million hectares, and 33,5% of it spread over the island of Kalimantan. The peatlands are rich of organic material and play an important role in the global carbon emissions cycle. The carbon tax regulation in Indonesia was enacted to achieve the carbon emission targets outlined in the Paris Agreement regarding the global response to the threat of climate change. The stakeholders must strive toward a green economy in an effort to reduce the carbon emissions. One of the palm oil plantation industries needs to align its activities to reduce carbon emissions by controlling the groundwater level (GWL) variables. A decrease in GWL can increase the risk of drought, which may lead to forest and land fires. This study aims to model GWL using anisotropic semivariogram geostatistical modelling to control GWL. Anisotropic semivariogram modelling considers the the distance and direction between observation locations, allowing the estimation of the impact of groundwater level (GWL) reduction from one palm oil plantation location to another. Often, the GWL data contains outliers, so outlier detection is performed using Moran's I statistical test, followed by a Yeo-Johnson transformation. After that, the estimation of the semivariogram model parameters is carried out using Ordinary Least Squares-Trust Region (OLS-TR). Based on the selected semivariogram model, the GWL values at unobserved locations can be predicted through Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation methods. The results indicate that the Yeo-Johnson transformation can reduce the variability of the experimental semivariogram and produce an anisotropic Gaussian semivariogram model. The prediction map of GWL distribution shows the presence of spatial anisotropic effects in the Northeast-Southwest direction. © 2024 Computers and Industrial Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to verify the link between climate change, changes in land use, and the increasing frequency of forest fires in the state of Acre. Recognizing the importance of an accurate assessment of fire risk, we also proposed a new fire risk index for the capital Rio Branco, using meteorological data. Validated reanalysis data from 1961 to 2020 extracted for Rio Branco and different land uses were used. Data on fire foci, deforestation, and agricultural crops were also obtained. The new model was based on the Fire Risk Atlantic Forest (FIAF) Index, developed for the Atlantic Forest biome, and was subjected to multiple regression analysis. To validate the new model, projections were calculated using different scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The new model, entitled Rio Branco Fire Risk (FIRERBR), revealed an increase in fire risk, especially associated with agriculture, in future scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) from 2023 onward. Rainfall and relative air humidity also showed a reduction in projections, indicating a higher degree of fire danger for the region. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020–2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030–2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Intensification of livestock systems becomes essential to meet the food demand of the growing world population, but it is important to consider the environmental impact of these systems. To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (−53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (−26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (−72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Coastal eutrophication and urban flooding are increasingly important components of global change. Although increased seawater renewal by barrier openings and channelizing are common mitigation measures in coastal lagoons worldwide, their effects on these ecosystems are not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the relationships between human interventions in the watershed, artificial connections to the sea, and the sediment burial rates in an urban coastal lagoon (Maricá lagoon, Southeastern Brazil). Sediment accretion along with nutrient and carbon burial rates were determined in two sediment cores representing the past ∼120 years (210Pb dating) and associated with anthropogenic changes as indicated by historical records and geoinformation analyses. Lagoon infilling and eutrophication, expressed by the average sediment accretion, TP, TN, and OC burial rates, respectively, increased ∼9–18, 13–15, 11–14 and 11–12-fold from the earliest (<1950) to the most recent (2000–2017) period. These multi-proxy records confirm mechanistic links between deforestation, urbanization, and untreated sewage discharges. In addition, our findings reveal artificial connections to the sea may contribute to lagoonal eutrophication and infilling, particularly when not integrated with sewage treatment and forest conservation or reforestation in the watershed. Therefore, increased seawater renewal by physical interventions commonly considered as mitigation measures may in contrast cause severe degradation in coastal lagoons, causing harmful consequences that should be not neglected when implementing management practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global climate change impacts all aspects of human life, including agriculture. Coffee is a major export commodity for Lampung Province. El Niño and La Niña can reduce coffee production by 80 %. Agroforestry coffee planting pattern is one of the steps to minimize the impact of climate change. This research, conducted from November 2022 to March 2023 in West Lampung Regency, focused on the Way Tenong, Air Hitam, and Batu Brak sub-districts. A survey method was employed, and a sample of 233 coffee farmers was selected through random sampling. The samples in this research were divided into three groups, namely monocropping coffee systems (MCS), simple agroforestry systems (SAFS), and complex agroforestry systems (CAFS). The level of livelihood vulnerability of farm households was analysed using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index. Overall, farm households on monoculture coffee farms had higher livelihood vulnerability compared to farm households on SAFS and CAFS. Factors significantly affecting the vulnerability of coffee farming households to climate change include farmers’ knowledge of climate change, drought, rainfall patterns, pest and disease outbreaks, as well as the adoption of SAFS and CAFS. Implementing agroforestry systems in coffee farming can help reduce this vulnerability. © 2024 Lesotekhnicheski Universitet (University of Forestry). All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation agriculture, a sustainable farming practice combining no or minimum soil disturbance, crop diversification, and soil cover, can benefit humans and the biophysical environment. However, less than half of Sub-Saharan African countries implement conservation agriculture, and the majority of smallholder farmers are using unsustainable practices. Research and field trials on conservation agriculture adaptation to soil and agroecological conditions are vital for increasing adoption of conservation agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the change in soil chemical properties and soil biology from implementation of conservation agriculture, (ii) assess cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) yield and variability under conservation agriculture compared to the conventional farming practice, and (iii) evaluate differences in soil chemical properties, soil biology, and crop yields under conservation agriculture in savannah and forest ecosystems compared to conventional agriculture in smallholder farming in the province of Maniema in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Soils under conservation agriculture had 6.5 times more (p < 0.001) earthworms, 23% and 10% greater (p < 0.05) concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium, respectively, and 100% greater (p < 0.001) cowpea yield than soils under conventional agriculture. Measured across all sites, conservation agriculture and conventional cowpea yields had coefficients of variation of 25% and 16%, respectively. This study showed for the first time that conservation agriculture implementation contributes to soil health and food security associated with smallholder farming in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Regenerative agriculture practices, including crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage, and no-tillage, have gained recognition for mitigating soil erosion and enhancing soil quality. This study focuses on organic vegetable production in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where soils are sandy and nutrient-poor. The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical–chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance. This research highlights the potential of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops to improve soil fertility, enhance carbon sequestration, and support sustainable agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the development of agroforestry tourism areas in Batu City, Indonesia. An area becomes resilient and robust through community participation in adapting, especially in the forestry village environment. This study will reveal community participation in managing land conservation areas and educational tourism in Oro-Oro Ombo Village, Batu City. The study is a qualitative research type of centralized interview to find community participation when managing a land conservation area. In February 2022, there were 25 informants in the form of 20 members of forest farmer groups, 6 village institutions, and 4 related official institutions who were interviewed using the in-depth interview method. The interview results were collected and processed using the help of a qualitative application, i.e., Altas.ti version 9. The d issemination of interview text was propagated using an enumerator with a voice recorder help tool. The results showed that the results of data processing of the word 'Management' are the words with the most frequency, i.e., 7.43% of all research data sources community. Participation in the management of land conservation areas and educational tourism, followed by the words 'area' and 'conservation', was 6.86% of all research data sources. If concluded with four stages of participation, i.e., planning, implementing, utilizing results and evaluating the community, they were very concerned about the sustainability of conservation land management, so that they have full participation in advancing this land as a potential economic land. This example can be used as a government policy to find the best method to foster community awareness to produce excellent participation in advancing a forestry area. The advanced Forest Farmers Group will become a new face in empowering the community in the future. © 2024, University of Guilan. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several studies investigated the occurrence of fires in Africa with numerical modeling or applied statistics; however, only a few studies focused on the influence of El Niño on the fire risk using a coupled model. The study aimed to assess the influence of El Niño on wildfire dynamics in Africa using the SPEEDY-HYCOM model. El Niño events in the Eastern Tropical Pacific were classified via sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly based on a predefined climatology between 1961 and 2020 for the entire time series of SST, obtaining linear anomalies. The time series of the SST anomalies was created for the region between 5° N and 5° S and 110° W and 170° W. The events were defined in three consecutive 3-month periods as weak, moderate, and strong El Niño conditions. The Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) was applied to detect fire hazards. The MFDI simulated by the SPEEDY-HYCOM model for three El Niño categories across different lagged months revealed relevant distinctions among the categories. In the case of ‘Weak’, the maximum variability of fire risk observed at time lags (0, -3, -6, and -9 months) was primarily in Congo, Gabon, and Madagascar. The ‘Moderate’ pattern had similar characteristics to ‘Weak’ except for the lag-6 months and its occurrence in the equatorial zone of Africa. ‘Strong’ showed a remarkable impact in East Africa, resulting in high fire risk, regardless of time lags. Precipitation and evaporation simulations (SPEEDY-HYCOM) indicated that El Niño categories in Africa need particular attention in the central, southern, and southeastern regions emphasizing the significance of lag-0 and lag-6 (evaporation) as well as lag-0, lag-6, and lag-9 (precipitation). The SPEEDY-HYCOM coupled model in conjunction with the MFDI was efficient in assessing climate variabilities in Africa during El Niño events. This model allows the analysis and prediction of wildfire risks based on El Niño events, providing crucial information for wildfire management and prevention. Its simulations uncover significant variations in risks among different El Niño categories and lagged months, contributing to the understanding and mitigation of this environmental challenge. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration spotlights the urgent need for global efforts to restore ecosystems and mitigate climate change. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha−1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha−1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forest restoration has gained traction as a solution to mitigate climate change, contribute to biodiversity conservation, and support forest livelihoods. Yet there is limited evidence on the spatial locations where restoration is most likely to occur. In landscapes that primarily contain private properties, assessing the likelihood of restoration can be informed by understanding the enabling and limiting factors that have influenced property-level restoration in the past. In this paper, we tested the relationships between restoration, property size, and forest cover, for 8451 properties between 1985 and 2019 in Southern Bahia, Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We found that spatial property-level variables were strongly associated with restoration. First, we found that property size was positively correlated with the amount of restoration per property. Medium-sized properties (between 40 and 127 ha) accounted for the most restoration in aggregate. Second, we found that properties with less forest cover were associated with higher amounts of restoration. In addition, for properties larger than 20 ha, those with intermediate amounts of forest cover had high amounts of restoration. Third, we found that restoration was a spatial process that occurred in hotspots rather than randomly across the study landscape, indicating that restoration often occurred near to other restored properties. Understanding these relationships may assist restoration planners in making more informed estimates of the conditions that might enable future restoration. Given that restoration is a complex process that may require different approaches in different socio-environmental contexts, decision-makers may consider identifying and prioritizing properties of different sizes and with different amounts of forest cover depending on their specific priorities, landscape-level conditions, and restoration context. Our spatial analysis techniques assist in improving broader understanding of possible ways in which land use policy could prioritize for restoration at the property level and could later be applied to other socio-environmental tropical forest systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 2022, the Global Mangrove Alliance (GMA) released the latest map of the world's mangroves. Southeast Asia is home to the most extensive mangrove forests, with Indonesia contributing one-fifth of the world's total mangrove area. Given this, government policies and in-depth studies are needed. The purpose of this study is to contribute to and complement the studies conducted by previous researchers. This study uses the bibliometric analysis methodology with VOSviewer and the biblioshiny package in RStudio. This study investigates the development of international publications and research on mangroves in Indonesia. The methodology and framework were adapted from the bibliometric analysis procedures developed by Donthu in 2021. The published results and findings on mangroves increased by 475%. There is a scientific collaboration between world scientists and Indonesian scientists, for example, the collaboration of Kauffman J.B. Alongi D.M., Murdiyarso D., and Basyuni. The book World Atlas of Mangroves, written by M. Spalding et al., and the book Mangrove Guidebook for Southeast Asia, written by Giesen et al., have received many citations and have become essential references for many world mangrove researchers. Many Scopus journals that have a high h-Index and ranking (Q) have published publications on mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia, for example, Biodiversity (Q2), AACL Bioflux (Q2), and Ocean and Coastal Management (Q1). Many keywords related to various aspects of the mangrove ecosystem were found: conservation, biodiversity, blue carbon, ecotourism, climate change, remote monitoring, avicennia marina, rhizophora, and seagrass. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2023.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Human-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers’ awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans. Methods: We used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Results: We found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses. Conclusion: The study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives. Implications for Conservation: The study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers’ perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Tropical peatlands lie at a nexus of competing sustainable development demands of enhancing food security, mitigating climate change, improving resilience and supporting rural livelihoods. Meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires balancing these various demands. Progress in meeting SDGs has been slow in low to middle income countries because of difficulties in identifying and quantifying the trade offs associated with natural resource exploitation, including on extensive areas of tropical peatlands. Here, by using secondary data from the literature, Indonesian and international agencies, we examine how land-use allocation in Indonesia has developed over the last three decades by investigating trends of key food and woody crops (oil palm and rubber) and evaluate the role that peatland provinces have played in food security and climate forcing. Overall, food crop production has been marginal in peatland provinces compared to monoculture woody crops, with the latter associated with increased carbon emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) over the last thirty years. Our analysis shows that synergies between responses to looming food security and climate change crises can also promote less damaging forms of tropical peatland management. For instance, the conversion of degraded shallow peatlands to agroecological practices (e.g., paludiculture) can be promoted. However, we stress that peatland conservation and restoration must remain the top priority. Impediments due to lack of a common definition for peatland and planning/management units, the use of multiple sectoral maps by different government agencies and uncoordinated sectoral policy targets can, however, hinder the implementation of less damaging peatland management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Sipongi System is essential in dealing with forest and land fires because this system provides real-time data that empowers stakeholders and communities to proactively overcome fire dangers. Its advantages are seen in its ability to provide detailed information regarding weather conditions, wind patterns, water levels in peatlands, air quality, and responsible work units. This data facilitates efficient decision-making and resource allocation for fire prevention and control. As an embodiment of Collaborative Governance, the Sipongi System actively involves various stakeholders, including government institutions, local communities, environmental organizations and the private sector. This cooperative approach fosters collective responsibility and accountability, improving fire management efforts. The Sipongi approach is critical in reducing forest and land fires in Indonesia by providing real-time data and a collaborative governance model. This results in faster response times, more effective fire prevention and better resource allocation. Although initially designed for Indonesia, the adaptable nature of the system makes it a blueprint for addressing similar challenges in other countries and regions, tailored to specific needs and environmental conditions. Qualitative research methods underlie this study, including interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of credible sources. Government officials, community leaders, environmental experts and organizational representatives were interviewed to comprehensively examine the mechanisms of the Sipongi System and its impact on forest and land fire management in Indonesia. Future research should explore the application of Sipongi Systems and collaborative governance in various contexts by conducting comparative studies across countries and ecosystems. Additionally, assessing the long-term impact and sustainability of the Sipongi System is critical to evaluating its effectiveness over time. © 2024 by author(s).

AB  - Air pollution remains a major global challenge in addressing environmental and health issues requiring continuous and immediate action. Nevertheless, the extensive adverse effects from atmospheric pollution are mainly experienced by communities and people in lower- and middle-income countries, such as the medium- and large-sized cities in Latin America including the coastal city of Guaruja in Brazil. Urban forests, as integral parts of the city landscape, play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution and should therefore be considered in environmental policies. This study aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal concentrations of air pollutants using the biological monitoring method with Tillandsia usneoides L. to highlight the capacity of urban forests to act as nature-based solutions (NbS) in improving air quality and providing other ecosystem services. Based on the quantification of chemical indicators of vehicle emissions, scientifically recognized as traffic-related elements (TREs) such as cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the biomonitoring samples, the results showed spatiotemporal variations in their concentrations. This finding demonstrates that urban fragments in the low-income settlement of the city exhibited higher values for TREs during the wet season. Cu values were the highest during the wet season in all study areas, underscoring the intensity of the light vehicle fleet. Forest fragments attenuated air pollution, highlighting their importance as features of environmental planning. The identification of atmospheric pollution hotspots in the territory guided the strategic implementation of NbS through tree planting, thus promoting a healthier environment with greater mitigation potential. This study is the first in Brazil to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and urban forests in highly dense and low-income settlements providing quantitative indicators toward the benefits of NbS. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - CONTEXT: Serious games have gained popularity as an innovative participatory approach to explore the complexity of social-ecological systems, managing the trade-offs between economic and ecological targets. Serious games can be abstract and generic, or more complex and specific. They can be used to raise awareness, increase shared understanding of options and risks, and/or commitment to common goals. OBJECTIVE: We here aim to clarify design principles applied in the FORCES game (Farmer Options and its Risk in Complex Ecological-Social systems) as single-player game to be easily adaptable to diverse (upper) watershed contexts. Three steps involved are game design (balance generic and site-specific information), game use in (and possibly adaptation to) specified context(s) and evaluation of contextualized impacts. METHODS: The FORCES game design was based on three contrasting watershed case studies in East Java, Indonesia, rather than on single, specific case study. Game development consisted of preparation (defining the context, generic core issues and game objectives), development process (ideating, setting the actors, resources, elements, and mechanisms), and assessment (prototyping, exploration of solution space, game trial and player feedback). Fifty-five smallholders played the FORCES in three landscapes to test the game's performance and impact on participants' insights. Therefore, we recorded every game session and performed pre- and post-game interviews for each participant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The developed FORCES game focuses on decisions of individual farmers involving plot-level plant (annual crops, trees) choices with financial cost-benefits consequences and links to ecological impacts on the litter layer, water balance, and erosion. The FORCES game was successfully applied in three distinct landscapes, demonstrating its adaptability. The game's generic water balance supported the transferability to different contexts, while fine-tuning of plot management options to reflect local variation was simple due to the solid underlying game mechanics. According to players, the game reflects local dynamics in the landscapes and provides a realistic experience, triggering participants to make decisions close to their real-life choices and learn from the consequences. While the game has limited representation of social interactions due to its single-player design, FORCES allowed relational values to be recognized in players' responses. SIGNIFICANCE: Balancing the combination of generic setting with easily adaptable site-specific elements in the game design plays an essential role to increase game adaptability and reusability to different locations. FORCES adds to the growing array of games that can be used to support farmers' participation in higher-level decision-making processes to secure environmental services in productive landscapes. © 2023

AB  - In Indonesia, smallholders have historically practiced agroforestry, which warrants examination in terms of food and livelihood security within sustainable community forest frameworks. Based on a literature review, we analyzed these two forms of security related to smallholder agroforestry practices. Findings indicate diverse agroforestry systems, with 88% focusing on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and 12% on timber. While 42% prioritize direct food supply, 58% emphasize income generation through product sales. However, agroforestry that does not produce food for direct consumption by smallholders generates revenue for purchasing food necessities. Agroforestry supports both food needs (46–61%) and income (51–54%) for smallholders, surpassing traditional agriculture (13%). Semi-commercial agroforestry (57%) is a predominant livelihood prospect. The remaining 27% are purely subsistence, and 15% are purely commercial. However, the commercialization of agroforestry that focuses only on high-value commodities results in a negative impact on biodiversity. There is a concomitant decrease in environmental services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Biodiversity remains crucial for climate resilience, health care, and food security in rural communities. Semi-commercial agroforestry is a midpoint for achieving multifunctional agriculture (biodiversity, soil and water conservation, food security, and income) in the climate change era. The research directly related to food security and ecosystem services quantification remains limited, necessitating further investigation. Policy support and incentives are essential for smallholders practicing complex agroforestry for climate adaptation and mitigation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Fire is a common disturbance in the Brazilian savanna (the cerrado), wherein high-frequency fires drive the vegetation structure, composition, function, and dynamics of savanna ecosystems. Under climate change pressure, further understanding of fire–vegetation relationships and interactions can provide new approaches for establishing integrated fire management strategies and can promote post-fire savanna vegetation recovery. To understand how 15 years of annually manipulated burning has affected vertical and horizontal structures of the vegetation, species composition and diversity metrics (species richness, Shannon’s diversity, and Pielou’s evenness), and aboveground carbon stocks, we surveyed all woody plant species with a diameter greater than three centimeters, in 15 plots of a typical Brazilian savanna (cerrado stricto sensu) at an experimental research station in central Brazil (the cerrado biome). The 15 plots (five plots per treatment) had been differently affected by fire events over a decade, and comprised three treatments: (i) annual fire, (ii) legacy fire (>15 years since the last fire event), and (iii) control (not burned in the past 30 years). A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis indicated that fire had a significant effect on the species composition among the treatments; some species benefited from fire, such as Erythroxylum suberosum, whereas other species propagated better without fire, such as Roupala montana and Dalbergia miscolobium. Over a decade of annual fire events have led to decreases in Shannon’s diversity, species richness, and stem density, which were significantly lower in the annual fire treatment than in the control and legacy fire treatments. Stem density by diameter and height size classes (except for the 1–2 m class and above 8 m class) was higher in the control than that in the annual fire treatment, but the number of dead trees did not differ between the control and the annual fire treatment. Our results also showed that fire was a factor in changes in the evaluated parameters, such as in the annual fire treatment, where fire reduced the amount of biomass, and therefore the carbon stocks. This study suggests that, if burned yearly, typical Brazilian savannas can become less biodiverse in terms of woody plant species which negatively affects their fire resilience. Therefore, fire management practices should focus on determining the frequency of fire disturbances from which these ecosystems may benefit the most. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is a severe environmental problem worldwide, affecting many sectors, particularly agriculture. Monitoring climate fluctuation in agricultural areas is a substantial way to maintain food security, especially in Indonesia. The rise of surface temperature contributes to the drought phenomenon that triggers various agricultural problems, such as crop disease, production loss, land conversion, soil nutrient depletion, and biodiversity loss. With this sense, implementing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) schemes is necessary to secure food production, climate resiliency, and environmental sustainability. Land surface temperature (LST) derivation by using satellite-borne technology is an invaluable solution for monitoring climate dynamics in vast agricultural lands. This study were used temperature bands from the TIRS sensor of Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate LST in the Middle Citarum watershed. This research aimed to estimate LST series during 2013-2023 dry seasons, which acts as an initial warning system for mitigating drought occurrence in Middle Citarum. This study revealed that the average of LST values during 2013-2023 spanned from 22.54°C to 33.14°C, which somewhat unsuits to optimal rice production. The highest temperature during these periods was 38.98°C, occurred in 2015. This condition was also associated with the 2015 drought event, which was an unparalleled warming worldwide. Based on the LST derivation in the study area, since 2018 to 2023, maximum land surface temperature has steadily been above 30°C. This suggests that drought probability has risen, and the figure should warn of potential failure in crop production during the season. With the development of LST time series, these data sets could contribute to an effective strategy as part of CSA adoption to understand and mitigate drought. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts is pointed out as one of the main factors altering biogeochemical cycles in the Amazon basin. An eco-nutritional approach using X-ray fluorescence micro-analysis (µXRF) is proposed to verify the long- and short-term effects of droughts on the growth and xylem nutrient concentrations of Cedrela fissilis Vell. Methods: Fourteen radii were selected from a tree-ring width chronology and X-rayed by Itrax Multiscanner. Profiles of ring width, wood density, and concentrations of aluminum (Al), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and strontium (Sr) together with Al/Ca, Ca/Mn, K/Ca, Sr/Ca and Mn/S ratios were constructed and correlated with precipitation, temperature, the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-PET) and standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Results: During dry years, C. fissilis showed narrower, less dense rings, lower Al, P, S and Ca, and higher K and Fe concentrations (the opposite was found in wet years). Ring width decreased (together with Al, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Sr, Al/Ca, K/Ca and Sr/Ca) and wood density increased (together with Ca/Mn and Mn/S), which was associated with an increase in evapotranspiration and temperature over time, mainly since 1990. Cedrela fissilis showed a tendency to increase its capacity for resistance, and a recovery and resilience in growth over time associated with responses in Al, Ca, P and S. However, it showed a risk in the capacity for recovery of the pre-drought density values, associated with unsatisfactory responses in Al, Ca, K, Fe and P. Conclusions: This study is the first attempt to analyze tree-ring nutritional evidences of C. fissilis trees to climate sensitivity and resilience to drought, based on long-term data from seasonal moist tropical forests of the Amazon. Our data suggested that C. fissilis is undergoing alterations in the concentration, use and redistribution of nutrients associated with increasing wood density and decreasing growth over time, due to the increase of drought frequency in the southern Amazon. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) and coal waste slurry, byproducts of global mining and coal processing activities, represent significant environmental pollution concerns due to their acidic nature and high total suspended solids (TSS) content. The exploration of microbial treatment methods, specifically the utilization of microorganisms and their metabolic byproducts as bioflocculants, is underway to mitigate the adverse effects of these byproducts. This investigation assessed the effectiveness of 54 mixotrophic bacterial strains in treating coal waste slurry and AMD from coal mines located in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The bacterium Citrobacter freundii (strain SKC-4), cultured in SKC1 medium (comprising 225 mL of seawater from the Java Sea and 15 g/L molasses), demonstrated superior performance, reducing the TSS value from 4998.20 ppm to 16 ppm within an hour. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed an increase in the intensity of the C[dbnd]O and C[sbnd]N groups from protein amides and CH2 from carbohydrates, suggesting an interaction between bacteria and clay minerals in the coal waste slurry. The bacteria also played a crucial role in adjusting the pH of AMD, elevating it from 3.82 to 6.07 after one hour of conditioning with a bacterial culture to AMD ratio of 1:9. The interaction between bacteria and their metabolic products was further substantiated by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis, which detected the presence of an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of the potential of mixotrophic bacteria as bioflocculants in the biotreatment of coal waste slurry and AMD from coal mining operations. © 2023

AB  - Coastal urban areas in Indonesia commonly encounter complex environmental problems, including bad air pollution and high risk of flooding due to sea level rise and land subsidence. The existence of urban mangrove forests potentially contributes to mitigating the environmental problems. Preserving mangrove forests in coastal urban areas requires continuous support from all stakeholders, which can be strengthened by good understanding on the comprehensive benefits provided by these ecosystems. This study aims to quantify key ecosystem services from urban mangrove forest, with a case study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta. Four types of key ecosystem services were quantified, i.e., carbon storage, air pollutant absorption, microclimate regulation, and nature recreation. A vegetation survey was conducted in 30 sample plots to collect data for carbon storage, which covers above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and carbon on deadwood. The absorption of six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) was analysed using the i-Tree Eco model. Field measurements of air temperature and humidity, as well as interviews with 99 visitors, were performed to analyse microclimate regulation. This study found a high quantity of carbon storage within mangrove trees and deadwood in the study area (111.6 tonnes C/ha) as well as high amounts of air pollutants absorbed by mangrove trees (11.3 tonnes/year). Mangrove trees in the study area effectively regulated microclimate conditions, indicated by a significant difference in average daily air temperature and humidity between inside and outside the mangrove forest. Meanwhile, the number of visitors benefiting from its recreation services has fluctuated during the last five years, with an average of 138,550 people per year. We discuss the implications of the findings of this study for urban mangrove forest management, including how to integrate ecosystem services quantification into mangrove preservation and rehabilitation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Trees sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, storing it in branches, stems, and roots, where the belowground carbon fraction, approximately ¼ of the total amount, exhibits significant interspecies root biomass variability. Estimating the amount of carbon stored in tree roots of different species is key to understanding an important aspect of climate change and exploring how natural forests, urban tree planting policies, and reforestation projects might help to address it. In this context, one of the most prominent Non-Destructive Testing methods capable of estimating the diameter and length of roots at different depths is ground penetrating radar (GPR). It has been widely used for geological, archaeological, and geotechnical studies due to its accuracy in locating buried material in different contexts, although standards for the correct management of datasets related to belowground root systems are still been developed. This paper reports a GPR signal processing flow to estimate the root diameter of three species of tropical forest trees, and to demonstrate the method’s viability, a dataset was collected in a study area with a 900 MHz shielded antenna. A multi-stage data processing flow is then presented, including raw data, file format conversion, zero-time adjustment, background removal, signal gain, Stolt FK migration, and time-to-depth conversion with hyperbolic adjustment velocity. The resulting data were converted from true amplitude data to a trace envelope. High amplitudes on the envelope section, with lateral continuity in parallel sections, were interpreted as roots. However, the interpretation of outcomes encounters notable complexities, primarily attributable to the intricate nature of subsurface root architectures, the soil matrix characterized by significant clay content, and the co-occurrence of buried materials proximate to the arboreal subjects. Consequently, amplitudes discerned within ground penetrating radar (GPR) 2D sections necessitate cautious interpretation, as they are not immediately indicative of subsurface roots. To overcome this difficulty, this study used direct measurements of the roots in the field, to confirm the GPR data. Despite these complexities, the study demonstrates GPR’s efficacy, particularly in the uppermost soil layer-a pivotal carbon reservoir with a 96% correlation (R2) between GPR-derived coarse-root diameter estimates and field measurements.

AB  - Urban green areas are essential for the quality of life of people living in large cities. In Brazil, 84.7% of the population lives in cities; however, studies assessing urban tree cover distribution and population's accessibility to such spaces are scarce. We aim at assessing urban green areas' distribution and accessibility in Rio de Janeiro City, according to places where people live in and to dominant economic classes in each neighborhood. In order to do so, 123 public areas larger than 5,000 m were selected to the study, as well as the city's tree cover network. It was mainly done to analyze both tree vegetation distribution and afforestation rate per capita in each neighborhood in the city, and the profile of the population that has the greatest accessibility to herein selected green areas. In addition, the main aim of the present study is to analyze the likely contributions from tree cover to mitigate mean temperature increase in the city's neighborhoods. Based on the results, the white population, and the one with the highest income per capita, live in neighborhoods with milder temperatures, greater tree cover and closer to the selected areas. They potentially benefit more from ecosystem services than Black people and the low-income population. Finally, it is highlighted the need to find ways to achieve greater equity in the distribution of tree canopy coverage and accessibility to green areas. © 2024 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

AB  - Purpose. High dependence on land resources is often the main cause of large-scale land conversion and deforestation in Indonesia. However, as a country vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia continues to increase its efforts to improve forest management and reduce deforestation. This is also in line with Indonesia’s commitment to reduce emission levels to achieve Net-Zero Emissions by 2060, where the forestry sector will be the base of this achievement. This study aims to measure Indonesia’s progress during 1970–2018, especially in reducing deforestation. With this study, we can see trends in forest management in developing countries, especially Indonesia. In addition, based on available data, we can see which factors are most closely related to Indonesia’s deforestation rate. Methodology / approach. This study uses a time-series data analysis with Error Correction Method (ECM). This ECM is used to detect the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), which describes the relationship between environmental degradation and economic variables. In this study, EKC is used to assess further relationship pattern between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and deforestation. The relation pattern between this GDP and deforestation is tested using quadratic and cubic models. Results. Under the quadratic model, a classic inverted U-shape EKC is detected in this study. It means that with economic growth and technological improvement, deforestation can be reduced. In other words, Indonesia has improved its forest management. However, as the N-shape relation was also detected in further cubic model simulation, it is also an indication that, at some point, Indonesia is also prone to increase its deforestation again. Another finding from the model is that the palm oil plantation area strongly relates to the deforested area. At the same time, the simulation detects a negative relationship between the horticulture cropland and the deforested area. The result may capture an insight into the forest transition period in Indonesia. In this transition, the government has started to slow down the speed at which forests are exploited in various ways. Originality / scientific novelty. Although the forestry sector is an important economic sector for Indonesia, there is still limited research on this topic, especially at the national level. This study uses more updated statistical information to better describe the Indonesian forestry condition. Moreover, the analysis is aligned with the Indonesian land policy by introducing additional variables from palm oil and crop areas. Moreover, the previous EKC assessments in Indonesia usually only use the quadratic model, which has some limitations in detecting other turning points and seeing the existence of N-shaped or inverted N-shaped EKC. This study also tries to add a bit on cubic model assessment to detect this N-shaped EKC in Indonesia. Practical value / implications. This study gives broader information based on the available data and statistics on the country’s deforestation situation and how the economic situation affects it. Policymakers can use the materials from this study to develop an effective forest management system throughout Indonesia. © 2023, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas—Pará, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years). © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Understanding the interaction between chemical and biological soil variables and their impact on the agronomic performance of agricultural crops is critical for enhancing management practices and promoting sustainability in agriculture. Thus, this study aimed to identify canonical correlations between chemical and biological soil variables and the yield components of maize under a subtropical climate in Brazil. Six experiments were conducted, with planting carried out in two different seasons across three locations. Four experiments occurred in rainfed areas, while two utilized pivot irrigation during the 2020/2021 growing season. Three hybrids were sown with three replications in each experiment. All 54 experimental units were evaluated for chemical and biological soil variables, as well as maize yield components. A canonical correlation analysis was conducted between the groups of variables, along with a test for comparing means for the yield components. The planting in two different seasons was exclusively employed to increase the variability of the interaction among the evaluated variables and was not considered in the analyses and interpretations. The results underscore the profound influence of soil and climatic conditions on the interaction between variables, as observed through the canonical correlation. In the irrigated location, a significant correlation between chemical and biological soil variables was observed, accompanied by the highest means in yield components. This emphasizes the need for balanced fertilization to stimulate soil biological activity and enhance grain production. Conversely, in nonirrigated locations, a significant correlation between biological soil variables and yield components was found. Strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of water deficit, such as the addition of plant materials and crop rotation, emerge as viable alternatives. These practices promote the activity of soil microbiota, expanding benefits such as nutrient cycling, with consequential impacts on grain productivity. © (2024), (Southern Cross Publishing).

AB  - The Semiarid region in the Northeast of Brazil is characterized by Caatinga tropical forests, adapted to 8-to-9 months of annual water stress. Human activities have resulted in environmental degradation due to tree removal and soil exposure to erosion factors; however, planting native trees, such as Mimosa tenuiflora and Cnidoscolus quercifolius, may accelerate environmental recovery. Tree recovery was evaluated in a degraded areas under a 14-year period of grazing exclusion (2005 to 2019) and planting of M. tenuiflora (2005 and 2009) and C. quercifolius (2007 and 2009) and under natural regeneration. Data on survival, height, and diameter of planted seedlings, and the number, species, height, and diameter of naturally regenerating trees were collected. The absence of grazing allowed for the establishment of 50.5% and 44.6% of the 204 M. tenuiflora and 204 C. quercifolius planted seedlings, which presented mean heights of 395 and 355 cm and mean basal diameters of 92 and 76 mm. Naturally regenerated M. tenuiflora and C. quercifolius totaled 190 and 7 plants, with heights of 95 and 139 cm, and basal diameters of 10 and 26 mm. A naturally established specimen of Cenostigma pyramidale with a height of 175 cm and basal diameter of 36 mm was found. This denotes the positive effect of seedling planting on tree cove compared to a nearby continuously grazed area; however, full recovery, especially regarding diversity of the tree community, requires more than 14-year grazing exclusion, tree planting, and natural regeneration. © 2024, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

AB  - Indonesia needs a daily monitoring system due to its frequent fires and, more importantly, to assist stakeholders in the field in taking action to mitigate disasters. Our method simplified the number of hotspots for field-based purposes and was verified by comparing the point-based (point-HS) VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) 375m-derived temperature anomalies (hotspots) and clustered-based hotspots (cluster-HS, our suggested method). Using Euclidean clustering, we calculated the distance between hotspot points and applied specific criteria to reduce the number of hotspots while aligning them closely with fire incidents. We evaluated accuracy at different fire sizes, burned areas, peatlands, and distances from the reported burn center. We found that the accuracy increases at 1.5 km from the center of the fire for both point- and cluster-HS at 52% and 53%, respectively. For areas larger than 14 ha, both types of hotspots yielded superior results of 83%. Cluster-HS performs better on peatlands than non-peatlands (62% vs. 57%). Without diminishing the precision of the hotspot observation, this study indicates that our method is reliable for assisting field stakeholders in the field in taking actions. Therefore, this product could be implemented into Indonesia’s daily hotspot monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has been a critical issue affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reforestation strives to remedy this situation, yet it is futile as long as deforestation of primary forests continues. Since deforestation is partly motivated by the demand for valuable tropical wood, reforestation should focus not only on planting native tree species, but specifically on a high diversity of native tree species with high-quality wood. However, the eco-physiological information required for growing such species is limited, and their resilience to drought events is unknown. Here, we focused on four native tropical wood tree species identified as suitable for Brazil’s Atlantic Forest reforestation. Growth, carbon assimilation, water-use and xylem hydraulics were studied in seedlings of the two legume species Dalbergia nigra and Plathymenia foliolosa and the two non-legume species Cariniana legalis and Zeyheria tuberculosa. Seedlings were monitored weekly for 9 consecutive weeks, three to five weeks of which under induced drought. Growth and carbon assimilation were 25–65 per cent higher in the legume vs. non-legume species. In turn, non-legume species mostly avoided the drought by stomatal closure, producing a 50 per cent higher water-use efficiency (WUE) compared with the legume species. The average water potential at 50 per cent stomatal conductivity (Ψgs50) for legume species was −2.6 MPa, whereas for non-legume species it was −0.85 MPa. Still, each species showed a unique set of responses, indicating different growth strategies under mesic and xeric conditions. Our results indicate a divergence among legume and non-legume species, driven by a trade-off between plant productivity (carbon assimilation and growth) and plant safety (stomatal regulation and WUE). All in all, the four species of juvenile potted plants demonstrated a high capacity for recovery from drought, which supports their potential role in future reforestation under climate change. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The suitability of countries to deploy five greenhouse gas removal technologies was investigated using hierarchical clustering machine learning. These technologies include forestation, enhanced weathering, direct air carbon capture and storage, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and biochar. The use of this unsupervised machine learning model greatly minimises the likelihood of human bias in the assessment of GGR technology deployment potentials and instead takes a more holistic view based on the applied data. The modelling utilised inputs of bio-geophysical and techno-economic factors of 182 countries, with the model outputs highlighting the potential performance of these GGR methods. Countries such as USA, Canada, Brazil, China, Russia, Australia as well as those within the EU and Sub-Saharan Africa were identified as key areas suitable to deploy these GGR technologies. The level of certainty of the obtained deployment suitability categorisation ranged from 65 to 98 %. While the results show the need for regional collaboration between nations, they also highlight the necessity for nations to prioritise and integrate GGR technologies in their revised nationally determined contributions. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting (‘active restoration’): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using δ13C and δ15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha−1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha−1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had δ13C and δ15N values of 2.1 and 1.7‰, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10–30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 μg m−2 h−1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Actors across multiple levels, such as the private sector, national and subnational government institutions, and local communities, are expected to have the capacity to adapt to climate impacts and risks. This study analyzes how collaborative governance has been developed and carried out by multiple actors in everyday life to adapt to peatland fires in a situation where climate change variability drives fire occurrences. The case study research was undertaken on the east coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, where the challenge of annual peatland fires has increased in the last 15 years. The qualitative data were collected through participatory observations, faceto-face interviews with 35 key informants, and document analysis conducted in 2020. The research finding shows that structural arrangements, knowledge and learning, and resource sharing are essential dimensions in generating collaborative governance to adapt to peatland fires. Multiple actors in the community case study applied collaborative activities during the three adaptation stages: (1) anticipatory measures, (2) preparedness, and (3) responses through constructing canal blocks, conducting fire patrols, and fighting fires. Those collaborative activities are performed in everyday life and have reduced the potential occurrence of fires and the vulnerability of villagers to peatland fires. The study also highlights the effects of domination when powerful actors are unwilling to collaborate meaningfully with local actors, who sometimes share different interests and hierarchical positions. © 2023, Resilience Alliance.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international “4 per 1000″ Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 ± 15 Mg ha−1, significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 ± 13 Mg ha−1) and agroforestry system (25 ± 5 Mg ha−1), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha−1 below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In developing countries, rural farmers contribute significantly to food production, but their households are still vulnerable to poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. Food security is a concept that refers to the ability of a country or region to ensure the availability, accessibility, and utilization of sufficient and nutritious food for its entire population, both in normal situations and under crisis conditions such as natural disasters or political instability. Food security is critical as it is directly related to national security, public health, and sustainable development. To improve food security, governments and international agencies often focus on policies such as increased food production, diversification of food sources, sustainable management of natural resources, and food assistance programs for vulnerable populations. The practice of agroforestry in home gardens offers a variety of readily available, cost-effective, and nutritious food options, which plays a significant role in enhancing the food security of agricultural families. Agroforestry, an integrated land management system combining food crops, trees, and sometimes livestock, offers a potential solution to improve food security. By growing various crops, farmers are not solely dependent on a single source of food, which reduces the risk of crop failure. Agroforestry systems increase resilience to climate change by reducing the impact of natural disasters, such as floods and droughts. Trees can act as wind barriers, reduce soil erosion, and aid in water conservation. This qualitative research with a systematic exploratory approach and grounded analysis examines how agroforestry contributes to farmers' food security by conducting in-depth interviews with farmers in North Luwu, Indonesia. The study identified home garden categories of agroforestry and then evaluated the role of agroforestry food production in terms of securing the food needs of households. The study discovered that restructure food bolsters across various income brackets by promoting healthier eating habits. Additionally, food production enhances the sustainability of food supplies for households and the health and prosperity of agriculturalists. The primary obstacles to producing food at the household level were identified as secure access to appropriate land and the possession of adequate farming expertise. © (2024), (African Scholarly Science Communications Trust (ASSCAT)).

AB  - Araucaria angustifolia – ‘araucaria’– is a critically endangered conifer tree of great ecological, economic, and cultural importance occurring in subtropical forests and grasslands in southern Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling we estimated its distribution in the present and future scenarios (2050), assessed sources of uncertainties, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas, and indicated suitable sites for restoration efforts to maintain viable populations. For this, we generated and compared 11,484 models with different combinations of variables and parameters. The final model included variables related to climate, soil, and topography. The potential distribution of araucaria was estimated to be 489.8 × 10 3km2, with a predicted reduction in 2050 from 45% to 56% (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively). The reduction within remaining habitats is estimated to range from 32% to 44%. Combined, current habitat availability and climate change accounted for a reduction from 70% to 75% of the potential distribution. Only 5% of the current potential distribution is within protected areas, which may be reduced to 1%. In addition, 40% of suitable sites in remaining habitats are not protected, which may reduce to 24–28% in 2050. Restoration efforts may contribute to an increase of 42–45% of the remaining population. We show that estimates of araucaria distribution in the future are variable and dependent on climate projections and scenarios, however, the potential distribution in natural grasslands may remain stable. Coordinated actions involving the protection and restoration of habitats associated with population growth are urgent to improve the persistence of araucaria in the future. © 2023

AB  - In fruit tree breeding, selection indices are used to identify the genotypes that combine desirable commercial and non-commercial characteristics. As Theobroma grandiflorum is generally cultivated in agroforestry systems (AFS), there is a need to develop cultivars that are adapted to such environments. In this study, the objective was to select the most promising genotypes for their future use in AFS based on the additive index, a pioneering method for this crop. The trial was carried out for 12 years in an agroforestry system in the municipality of Tomé-Açu, Pará State, Brazil. The 16 evaluated clones were completely randomised with a variable number of repetitions. The average number of fruits produced as well as the morpho-agronomic characteristics of the fruits were analysed. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the components of variance and predict the genotypic values. The genetic correlation between the variables was estimated, and the selection of genotypes was based on the additive index, with a positive orientation of all variables except the thickness of the fruit shells and the weight of the fruits. Clones 42, 44, 46, 47, 57, 61, and 64 performed well for all the analysed variables, resulting in a selection gain of 7.3% and low incidence rates of witches’ broom disease. These genotypes can be made available to producers in the form of clones for use in AFS and can further be included in future hybridisations in T. grandiflorum breeding. © 2023, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - The scarcity of phenological studies based on different populations of tropical forest trees limits seed management and collection for reforestation efforts. Precipitation is the primary factor driving tropical plant phenology in seasonal environments, although other environmental variables and plant traits may be associated. We examined the seasonality, synchrony, and intensities of the vegetative and reproductive phenophases of four populations of Handroanthus spongiosus, an endangered species, under similar climate regimes in a seasonally dry tropical forest, in northeastern Brazil. We expected to observe some divergence in the phenologies of the populations related to distinct functional traits selected for by differences in rainfall and soil properties. Mature trees (n = 87) were monitored during a three-year period. Seasonality was examined using circular statistics, and the influences of environmental variables on phenophases were investigated using generalized additive models. Variations in intensities and activity indices were identified among the different populations. Vegetative phenophases were seasonal, driven by precipitation and photoperiod, with leaf longevity of up to 7 months; budding peaked in February-March, while leaf fall peaked in April and October. The reproductive phenophases were found to be seasonal, during the rainy season (November to April), influenced by temperature and photoperiod. The slight divergences noted among the phenological behaviors of the populations were related to distinct functional traits (e.g., tree height, stem diameter) selected for by differences in certain environmental variables (rainfall volumes and soil properties). Given ongoing global climate changes, increases in leaf fall and reductions of flowering intensity, as verified here, will likely be observed. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the temporal variability of CO2 emission (FCO2) from O2 influx into the soil (FO2) in a reforested area with native vegetation in the Brazilian Cerrado, as well as to understand the dynamics of soil respiration in this ecosystem. The database is composed of soil respiration data, agroclimatic variables, improved vegetation index (EVI), and soil attributes used to train machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The predictive performance was evaluated based on the mean absolute error (MEA), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), agreement index (d), confidence coefficient (c), and coefficient of determination (R 2). The best estimation results for validation were FCO2 with multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) (R 2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.967 µmol m−2 s−1) and radial basis function neural network (RBF) (R 2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.884 µmol m−2 s−1) and FO2 with MLP (R 2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.093 mg m−2 s−1) and RBF (R 2 = 0.74, 0.079 mg m−2 s−1). Soil temperature and macroporosity are important predictors of FCO2 and FO2. The best combination of variables for training the ANFIS was selected based on trial and error. The results were as follows: FCO2 (R 2 = 16) and FO2 (R 2 = 29). In all models, FCO2 outperformed FO2. A primary factor analysis was performed, and FCO2 and FO2 correlated best with the weather and soil attributes, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Approximately 5% of the total emissions (0.11 Gt CO2 and GWP-AR5) originate in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), a representative agricultural region in Southern Brazil. This study assessed SOCS (soil organic C stocks) in Latossolos of the Planalto of RS, with up-to-date data obtained from recent field campaigns and legacy data, and relate these SOC stocks to environmental variables. A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1). The highest stocks (237 ± 39 Mg ha-1) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distrófico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies. We concluded that, despite significant land use changes, soils of this region maintain large SOCS which had been underestimated in previous studies. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Mangroves play a vital role in the environment and contribute signific aptly to the well-being of coastal communities by providing goods and services. Unfortunately, the degradation and deforestation of mangroves has frequently occurred. Therefore, it is important to understand the vulnerability of mangroves and its impact on blue carbon storage for effective mangrove management and coastal planning. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of mangroves and its effect on blue carbon storage in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The vulnerability assessment included factors such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Blue carbon storage was evaluated based on carbon stock in sediment, biomass, and total carbon stock in mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas. The mangrove ecosystem in the protected area of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National (RAWN) Park showed lower vulnerability due to lower exposure, lower sensitivity, and higher adaptive capacity. On the other hand, mangrove ecosystems in unprotected areas such as Tinanggea (TNG), Kendari Bay (KDI), and Staring Bay (STR) exhibited moderate to high vulnerability due to higher exposure, sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity. Mangroves in RAWN Park, which were less vulnerable, had higher blue carbon storage in sediment (381.64 tons C/ha), biomass (312.65 tons C/ha), and the entire ecosystem (706.76 tons C/ha). These values were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to those in TNG (306.66 tons, 144.15 tons, and 448.37 tons C/ha, respectively), KDI (262.08 tons, 227.73 tons, and 470.76 tons C/ha, respectively), and STR (169.44 tons, 66.66 tons, and 253.27 tons C/ha, respectively). The high vulnerability of mangrove ecosystems resulted in reduced carbon storage in the coastal regions of Southeast Sulawesi. Therefore, efforts such as rehabilitation and restoration, legislation, and conservation should be prioritized to enhance blue carbon storage, and other ecosystem services provided by mangroves in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi.

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the influence of tree vegetation on basic soil functions reflected by soil structural stability (SSy), soil porosity (SPy), and soil total nitrogen (STN). Data were collected from 35 plots distributed across five stand types in the protected forest of Kulon Progo Community Forestry, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. (Pinus [PN], Aleurites-Swietenia [AS], Swietenia-Acacia [SA], Melaleuca-Acacia [MA], and Tectona-Dalbergia [TD] stands). Comparative analyses were applied to compare SSy, SPy and STN. The influences of tree vegetation and environmental factors on SSy, SPy and STN were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Our results showed that SSy, SPy and STN varied among plots and stand types where those were directly proportional to each other. Overall, PN stands exhibited less values of basic soil functions than other stands. In this regard, tree vegetation provided high influence on SSy, SPy and STN where the most important factor was an interaction among canopy coverage, soil organic matter and soil organic carbon which are directly proportional to each other and negatively correlated to below-stand utilization. Accordingly, dense-canopy trees are highly recommended for species enrichment by considering adaptive management systems, to ensure the ecological restoration process of degraded forests. © 2024, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - To restore 12 million hectares of native vegetation in Brazil by 2030, aligning environmental policies with incentive measures is crucial. The Ecological Fiscal Transfer (known as Ecological ICMS in Brazil) allows states to redistribute the ICMS tax (similar to the Value Added Tax) revenue based on environmental criteria, likely motivating municipalities to take environmental action. São Paulo recently modified its ecological ICMS legislation, increasing the ICMS revenue distributed according to environmental criteria and introducing a new criterion for native vegetation cover. We assessed the impact of these changes on tax redistribution, considering three scenarios: the former rules (2021), the new rules (2025), and the new rules with 1.5 million hectares of vegetation restored (2042). While the pattern of ICMS distribution remained mostly unchanged, there were distributional effects. Some municipalities lost up to 5% of their initial revenue, while others with high socio-environmental importance doubled their revenues. Existing environmental criteria still lack incentives for local environmental policies. However, the new criterion for native vegetation cover could, with practical limitations, boost municipal revenue after restoring 1.5 million hectares. São Paulo's initiative to incorporate native vegetation cover into an Ecological Fiscal Transfer policy holds the potential to inspire similar tax-based environmental incentives worldwide. However, it must be adapted to motivate local governments to embrace restoration actions rather than serving primarily as a compensatory measure. © 2023 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Cases of water level decrease and lake shrinkage have been found in almost every freshwater ecosystem. In Indonesia, Laut Tawar Lake in Upland Gayo, Indonesia, allegedly has experienced the shrinkage of surface area and water level decrease. This study aimed to identify the shrinkage area and water level decrease, and its driving force. We make use of the remote sensing data, which is processed by ArcMap Geographic Information System to capture the lake shrinkage and the land use dynamic surrounding the ecosystem. Land cover were captured by interpreting Landsat data, which we further calibrated and validated with approximately 119 ground checkpoints on the lakeside. For the water level analysis, we conducted field measurements of the water line from 41 measurement points surrounding the lake area. To analyze rainfall and temperature, we use Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data. Our study found approximately 2.4 percent or equal to 1.4 km2 of lake shrinkage in 35 years. Water level decrease occurs for 0.6 m and 1.3 m in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The shrinking was mainly caused by reclamation and sedimentation, while the water level decrease was mainly triggered by a massive reduction of water flow from rivers which reduced from 40 to 14 streams, accounting for 65% from previous years. These events were affected by land use change and temperature increase. This study offers a scientific finding to unravel the allegation of the shrinking of Laut Tawar Lake for lake conservation effort and environmental management in the future. Sustainable lake management was highly advised as part of conserving the study area as the biggest lake in Aceh Province. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern agriculture has had to face complex environmental issues, many of which result from land use, which includes the degradation of its fertility properties. Soil quality is fundamental to the sustainability of the planet, as it also affects other natural resources. Therefore, it must be seen as a fundamental action for the sustainability of the planet and be evaluated using methodologies capable of holistically relating the environmental impacts of production systems, as does the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. However, due to the lack of suitable models, LCA is still ineffective in assessing soil quality. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the use of chemical soil quality indicators in the context of LCA, contributing new information to the debate. To this end, a set of soil quality indicators from the APOIA-NovoRural method were applied in some agricultural production systems in southern Brazil. Thus, the LCA results confirmed soil quality maintenance activities as those that most contribute to impacts, particularly in the categories of climate change, (eco)toxicities and land use. However, the indicators efficiently contributed direct information about the agricultural environment, relating them to the impacts estimated by the LCA. Therefore, the use of indicators makes it possible to improve soil management by adjusting chemical parameters, accurately contextualizing activities, and use of inputs to the real conditions of the area assessed. Thus, we demonstrate that indicators can be useful in providing information for agricultural environmental management in interrelation with LCA, whose application alone is not yet capable of achieving such results. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of São Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goiás. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Several biomes worldwide have a long history of conflict over fire use and management. The Atlantic Forest Biome (AFB) is a Brazilian biome that suffers the most from land use and cover changes that cause environmental degradation. The impact of climate change is expected to exacerbate this situation, with extreme weather events potentially leading to a higher frequency and intensity of fire. The main goal of this study is to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of fires for future climate scenarios obtained from CMIP6 climate simulations in the AFB in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil, using machine learning algorithms. This study selected several environmental and anthropogenic variables as factors associated with the cause, occurrence, and spread of fire. The results showed an uneven fire density distribution in the study area. An extensive fire cluster was found in pasture areas located northeast of RS state, reaching more than 1500 fire foci per km2 on average per year. The final model had a training R2 value of 0.99 and a test R2 value of 0.93. The most significant variable identified by the model was the average maximum temperature during the warm period, while livestock is the most influential economic activity. Regarding the simulated fire densities, the period between 2021 and 2040 in the SSP 5.8–5 scenario displayed maximum values that were equivalent to those observed in 2018, with an expansion in the occurrence region observed for the same scenario. However, unexpectedly, between 2081 and 2100, fire density decreased across all areas under the SSP 5.8–5 scenario. This study provides useful insights into climate change context scenarios, offering valuable insights into the intricate relationship between natural processes and human influences, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and sustainable environmental management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Indonesia, progressing towards sustainable development, faces the complex task of transitioning to low-carbon agriculture in peatlands, an essential part of broader sustainable objectives. Under the Paris Agreement, it targets a conditional 41% emission reduction, focusing on minimizing emissions from peat decomposition and fires within agricultural practices in peatlands. This paper explores the complexities and progress of low-carbon agriculture in peatlands, underscoring its significance in the larger sustainable development agenda. Our study reveals that current strategies to reduce carbon emissions in peatlands aim at restoring their natural waterlogged conditions. Yet, progress is hindered mainly due to an inadequate understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands and overlooking their unique features, which leads to overestimated emissions from agricultural use. For improved strategies, it's important to analyze successful existing sustainable practices and enhance understanding of peatland ecology. Techniques like the "Water Management Trinity,"implemented since 1986, and eco-management emphasize the importance of using permanent water gates to maintain water levels optimal for both peat preservation and crop production. Over time, these practices modify peatland attributes, making emissions comparable to those from mineral soil, thus rendering low-carbon agriculture attainable. It's vital for stakeholders to assess emissions with updated data, incorporating detailed information on peatland characteristics and emissions. The journey towards low-carbon agriculture in Indonesia's peatlands is a complex endeavor necessitating the amalgamation of scientific research, sustainable practices, and socio-economic development. Adopting a holistic approach can strike a balance between agricultural productivity, peatland conservation, and climate change mitigation, fulfilling sustainable development goals in Indonesia and globally.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The landslide in Kiarapandak has destroyed several dwellings, impaired farming and agriculture, and critical land formation. Analysing the conditions before and after the landslide is essential for supporting sustainable development, protecting the community, and mitigating environmental damage. This investigation employs Google Earth imagery, site surveys, field observations, landslide typology, and vulnerability assessments. The research area, Kiarapandak, is categorized as a landslide-prone typology Zone B with a predominantly 21%-40% slope and more than 40%. The vulnerability level is high. In the critical land created by the landslide, there is a reduction in soil fertility due to surface stripping, increased erosion, and surface runoff, causing sedimentation and river flooding. Land rehabilitation efforts are necessary to improve the quality of land resources in the post-landslide area and support the ecosystem while generating economic value for affected landowners. An agroforestry system, with a vertical arrangement of species strata, can be implemented in the post-landslide location to serve ecological and financial functions and optimize land resource quality through fertilizer application. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Purpose: This study analyses the institutional management of blue carbon ecosystems in Indonesia. With transparent governance, blue carbon can be an effective tool to accelerate the achievement of NDC targets. Methode: This empirical juridical research applies a participatory approach involving discussions and interviews with several related parties. It also uses statutory and conceptual approaches. This paper presents a new construction of blue carbon ecosystem governance in Indonesia. Result and Conclusion: The overlapping authority between the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is resolved by applying the legal principles lex specialis derogate legi generali and lex posteriori derogate legi inferiori. To achieve ideal institutional governance of mangrove management, there is a need for a cooperation scheme between sectors of government agencies, namely between the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and the non-structural institution Peat and Mangrove Restoration Council. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Significant efforts have been invested to restore degraded peatlands in Indonesia considering the high mitigation potential as an effective natural climate solution. However, peat restoration in Indonesia faces challenges such as suboptimal planning and risk management. In this study, we assessed the national potential peat restoration area using spatial analysis and identified the associated risks based on lessons learned from past restoration efforts. We estimated the extent of potential restoration areas by analyzing canal networks, burnt areas, and critical land maps at the national scale. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, followed by a national workshop with relevant stakeholders to assess the potential risks and develop risk management strategies for peat restoration. Our analysis estimated 6 Mha, or 45% of Indonesia's total peatland area, as potentially restorable areas for rewetting and/or revegetation efforts. Of this potential area, 50% falls under concession holder management. The identified risks consisted of technical (39%), management (38%), social (17%), and economic (6%) factors, with 15 and 22% classified as extreme and high risk, respectively. Policymakers can use these findings to strengthen regulations and improve the chances of successful restoration implementation, supporting Indonesia's emissions reduction target and providing economic benefits for restoration actors. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can absorb significant amounts of carbon and help mitigate climate change. However, their existence continues to be endangered by natural and human forces. Therefore, mangrove restoration is regarded as a crucial component of the global climate change agenda. This study aims to estimate the potential total carbon stock of restored mangrove ecosystems in Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java. The above-below-ground (root) carbon stock was calculated using several published allometric equations. The loss-on-ignition method analyzed leaf litter and sediment carbon stocks. This study estimates the Pasarbanggi mangrove ecosystem's total carbon stock potential at 0.02 × 106 MgC, which is equivalent to the potential CO2 emission of 0.08 × 106 MgCO2e, with up to 65% stored in sediments. This study highlights the critical role of restored mangrove ecosystems on the climate change mitigation agenda by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study delves into an examination of the role played by local wisdom in the protection of forests. The recognition and acknowledgment of local wisdom, enshrined in customary law within the environments of indigenous peoples, encounters challenges, particularly when the legitimacy of customary law itself is in question, especially concerning forest protection. In addressing these concerns, a normative juridical approach was employed to scrutinize legal source materials. The findings of this research affirm that the recognition of indigenous peoples as legal entities, particularly under international law, necessitates collective consideration. Through this conceptual framework, indigenous peoples can assert their aspirations autonomously and even advocate for international policies aimed at safeguarding and upholding the rights of indigenous peoples globally, with predeter mined terms and conditions. The study underscores the contribution of local wisdom to forest protection, exemplified by the formulation of customary forest concepts applicable to indigenous communities. Local wisdom has demonstrated efficacy in averting and mitigating forest damage, particularly within customary forest areas, owing to the steadfast adherence of indigenous peoples to the principles encapsulated in their customary law. Moreover, the effectiveness of local wisdom in forest preservation is bolstered by the intrinsic characteristics of traditional indigenous communities, fostering wise and sustainable forest management practices. The study posits that the normative nature of customary law, as a living legal entity, may face ineffectiveness, potentially jeopardizing its own existence. Nonetheless, it contends that the state should formally recognize the exclusivity of customary law through constitutional and legal frameworks, thereby fortifying the application and viability of customary law within predetermined geographical areas and communities designated by the government. © 2023, Jambi University.

AB  - Rural communities like Telagah Village often have economies and ways of life deeply intertwined with their natural environment. They were particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their dependence on agriculture and forestry, which are directly affected by changes in weather patterns, temperature, and precipitation. This study aimed to assess community perceptions and participation regarding the impacts of climate change in Telagah Village, Sei Bingei Sub-district, Langkat Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight key informants who had lived in this village for a long time. Data analysis was carried out descriptively. The results of interviews with key informants in Telagah Village show that the most influential impacts of climate change are drought, uncertain weather conditions, and high rainfall. Forest land clearing is the main cause of climate change in this area. Community participation and perception in efforts to prevent the impacts of climate Community participation and perception in efforts to address climate change impacts are generally positive. Perceptions are very good (37.5%) and good (62.5%). Reforestation and forest conservation efforts have been carried out. Through its focus on Telagah Village, this research contributes valuable insights into the localized effects of global climate change, offering a basis for informed decision-making and sustainable development strategies in similar rural settings. Understanding the specific impacts of climate change on Telagah Village enables the development of tailored adaptation and mitigation strategies. It allows for targeted interventions that address the unique vulnerabilities and capabilities of the community, enhancing resilience to climate-related stresses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Congo Basin is home to the second largest tropical humid forest in the world and an important participant in climate change mitigation. While the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) boasts the largest proportion of Congo basin forests, it is also the main contributor to forest loss. Industrial logging concession is a forest management model that is likely to expand in the DRC in the coming years as the Government recently announced the probable end of the 2002 moratorium on logging concessions. It is thus crucial to understand whether this model can further the DRC's deforestation reduction efforts. The literature suggests that the effect of titling forestland on avoided deforestation and forest degradation is generally limited, unless environmental restrictions are enforced. The DRC's 2002 forest code introduced a new logging concession model that includes requirements to submit and implement Forest Management Plans (FMP) and increase benefit-sharing with communities. Our paper evaluates the impact of this new model of concession contracts signed in 2011 and 2014 on deforestation and forest degradation. We use remotely sensed data series to estimate difference-in-difference models. We ensured baseline parallel trends in deforestation and similarity in baseline characteristics between control and treated units. We find no evidence that deforestation and forest degradation is significantly different between logging concessions and control areas, even for concessions that had their FMP accepted. Our study highlights the need for evaluating the impact of FMPs once they are fully implemented, the importance to improve degradation outcome variables and to conduct complementary studies analyzing impact pathways. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The agricultural sector in Indonesia employs around 38.7 million people and contributes 14% to the nation's GDP is crucial to the economy. However, it faces significant challenges related to data transparency, supply chain ineffisciences, and optimal nutrient management. This paper aims to explore the potential of advanced technologies, specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain, to address these challenges and enhance the efficiency and productivity of the agricultural sector. We conducted a detailed examination through three case studies: the Smart Pest Management System for rice fields, Blockchain-enabled Traceability for coffee supply chains, and an IoT-based Soil Moisture and Nutrient Monitoring system for vegetable farms. These case studies illustrate the practical applications and benefits of these technologies in real-world agricultural settings. Our findings demonstrate that integrating IoT and blockchain technologies significantly improves data accessibility, security, transparency, and nutrient management. These enhancements lead to better decision-making processes, risk mitigation, and sustainable growth within the agricultural sector. The adoption of IoT and blockchain technologies presents a transformative opportunity for Indonesia's agricultural industry. By overcoming existing challenges and unlocking new opportunities, these innovations can substantially boost efficiency and productivity, contributing to the nation's economic development and advancing engineering practices. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Viticulture is the main agricultural production in the São Francisco Valley, Brazil; however, farm soil management systems require large volumes of fertilizer that could contribute to climate change. Therefore, using plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been reported to reduce or replace plant input. This study aimed to evaluate the bacteria in the rhizosphere of Vitis vinifera cultivated in the São Francisco Valley in Pernambuco, Brazil, and to characterize the mechanisms that promote plant growth. The PGPR with the greatest biotechnological potential was identified using sequencing. The bacteria were isolated from tryptic soy agar (TSA) culture medium inoculated with 100 µL of a serial dilution. The isolates obtained were characterized phenotypically and tested for their ability to solubilize phosphate, promote biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and produce indole-3 acetic acid (IAA), biofilms, and antibiotic factors against Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola. A total of 423 bacteria were obtained, of which 99 presented positive results for at least one of the growth-promotion mechanisms, representing 6.85% for phosphate solubilizers, 0.74% for BNF, 5.7% for IAA synthesizers, 11.27% for biofilm producers, and 4.01% for promoting antibiosis against X. campestris pv. viticola. Isolates 3.19 and 31.14; 3.17 and 17.04; 5.35 and 5.42; and 5.37 identified as Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Clostridium, respectively, presented a biotechnological potential for future experiments to promote vine growth. © 2024, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

AB  - The accelerated production of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to human activity has led to unprecedented global warming, making climate mitigation strategies crucial for minimizing its impacts. South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

AB  - Agroforestry systems are often promoted as solutions to address land degradation and climate change. However, agroforestry is an umbrella term for a large variety of systems and it is not clear how their degree of complexity influences their provision of soil-based ecosystem services, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains whether agroforestry systems perform equally well on all soil types. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the links between agroforestry complexity, nutrient cycling and SOC fractions, and 2) to assess how soil texture influences these relationships in Brazilian agroforestry systems. We sampled 59 agroforestry plots across 30 sites in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and 8 monocrop sites (6 pastures and 2 crop monocultures). The 38 sites represented a soil textural gradient, ranging from very sandy to very clayey (clay content range 25 – 620 g kg−1). An Agroforestry Complexity Index (ACI) was defined based on tree species richness, stem density and pruning management. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and C contents were determined in litter and soil (0–30 cm depth) samples, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC) in soil samples were assessed as well. ACI was positively associated with C, N, P, Ca and Mg stocks in litter, and these litter nutrients were in turn positively associated with the corresponding soil nutrient stocks. Associations between soil nutrients and MAOC were stronger on sandy soils than on clayey soils, particularly for P, Ca and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). For POC, robust relationships with nutrients were only found on sandy soils. Structural Equation Models indicated causal relationships between agroforestry complexity, P and Ca cycling, and MAOC and POC stocks in topsoils. Our results indicate that nutrients effectively cycle from in situ mulch into plant-available soil pools and highlight the synergies between nutrient cycling and stable C stocks that can be achieved in complex agroforestry systems. These synergies seem to be particularly strong on sandy soils (<15 % clay). © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Zayadi H, Hakim L, Sudarto, Batoro J. 2024. Plant diversity on coffee agroforestry land in the buffer zone of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in East Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 25: 1030-1036. Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (BTSNP) is facing threats to biodiversity due to land transfer functions and sand mining in rural areas. Land use conversion and sand mining in rural areas near BTSNP and Perhutani are threatening biodiversity through activities like land degradation, deforestation, forest depletion, and global climate change impacting local agriculture. Coffee farms in Poncokusumo and Wajak have been abandoned, leading to a decline in coffee farming and other agricultural commodities. Coffee-based agroforestry systems have been implemented to address this issue and improve soil fertility and vegetation diversity. This research aimed to identify and analyze plant diversity in coffee agroforestry land in BTNSP. The study was carried out in January-December 2022 in the village districts of Poncokusumo Sub-district (Sumberejo) and Wajak Sub-district of Malang District, which borders directly with BTSNP, collecting flora compositions and classifying them based on growth rate. The study identified 27 orders, 38 families, and 71 species of plants in the coffee fields. The presence of various plant species in the coffee fields contributes to the ecosystem's stability and the soil's quality. This research highlights the importance of the agroforestry system in promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable coffee farming in the BTSNP area. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - The vulnerability of peatland water storage function to climate change is a pressing issue that demands immediate attention. While climate change has been extensively studied in tropic, subtropic, and non-peatland areas, its specific impact on tropical peatland areas remains largely unexplored. This study, which focused on specific regions of tropical peatlands, aims to fill this crucial gap in our understanding. By evaluating changes in peatland hydrological characteristics with fluctuations in rainfall trends over several years (2040–2059), we can verify climate change's effect on water availability, especially the difference in land use, at two peatland locations, Sei Hiu and Bagan Melibur, in Riau Province, Indonesia. The three scenarios of climate models under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 that are MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, and MRI-CGCM3 in CMIP5 were developed. The correlation between rainfall measured in the field and the model output is quite significant, making it suitable for predicting future rainfall. Meanwhile, a similar trend in future water balance was estimated for both locations. Besides, the differences in soil and land use changes, especially in canal properties indicated by runoff coefficients, caused different patterns of changes in water storage. Higher rainfall intensity will likely increase water storage and surpluses in both areas to over 100 %. However, during particular months with low rainfall, water storage was bound to decrease, especially at the Sei Hiu in July, and this decline tended to occur more than twice. Results also showed that models in the same area yield more notable differences compared to similar scenarios in different areas. It was then concluded that the regions had a more significant influence than the model. © 2024

AB  - Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell.) Bureau ex Verl. is among the Brazilian flora threatened with extinction. It has high-quality wood and can be used to recover herbicide-contaminated areas. However, abiotic stresses can harm seed germination and seedling development under adverse conditions and need to be understood to improve autochthonous or indigenous biodiversity conservation and strengthen reforestation projects. This study evaluated the effects of temperature, water and saline stress on Z. tuberculosa seed germination and water stress on seedling growth. Three laboratory experiments evaluated germination under: (1) different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C); (2) different water potentials simulated with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) at 25 and 30 °C; and, (3) different osmotic potentials simulated with NaCl at 25 and 30 °C. In addition, a greenhouse experiment subjected seedlings to five water regimes (20%, 35%, 50%, 65% and 80% of maximum substrate water holding capacity). In the laboratory, seedling biometry and germination were evaluated, while physiological and morphological parameters were assessed in the greenhouse. Physiological potential of seeds increased at 25 and 30 °C. Germination and vigor decreased as water and saline stresses increased. Germination tolerance thresholds for water and salt stresses were − 0.6 and − 0.4 MPa, respectively. In the greenhouse, the most restrictive water regimes reduced seedling physiological and morphological parameters. Seedling development was compromised at moisture levels below 50% field capacity. © 2023, Northeast Forestry University.

AB  - The escalating rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels catalyzes accelerated global warming, profoundly impacting Earth's life. Within this context, forests emerge as crucial guardians of environmental equilibrium by actively absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process serves as a strategic mitigation measure against the perils of global warming. This study aims to determine the inherent potential of biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration within tree stands and poles existing within pine forests and agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village, Jepara, Central Java, Indonesia. Additionally, the study undertakes a comparative assessment of the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration attributes between two distinct forest types: homogeneous pine forests and heterogeneous forests represented by agroforestry systems within Bategede Village. The study was conducted in March in Bategede Village, Nalumsari District. Data was collected through non-destructive methods, focusing on tree stands with a diameter (at breast height) exceeding 20 cm and poles with a diameter (at breast height) ranging from 10 to 20 cm. Robust biomass calculations were computed through predetermined allometric equations. The results of this study show that the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration were recorded at 407.83 tons/ha, 191.68 tons/ha, and 703.46 tons/ha, respectively, in pine forests. Meanwhile, the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration values recorded in agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village were 120.64 tons/ha, 56.41 tons/ha, and 207.01 tons/ha, respectively. The comparative analysis revealed that homogeneous forests, particularly in the tree category, have carbon sequestration values that are sixfold greater than their heterogeneous counterparts. A parallel evaluation within the pole category demonstrated a twofold rise in carbon sequestration within heterogeneous forests compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This difference may be due to the interplay of factors, including variations in stem diameter, species composition, and number of individuals, all cumulatively influencing carbon sequestration within the homogeneous and heterogeneous forest ecosystems. © 2024, Smujo International.

AB  - Brazil is one of the largest soybean producer of the world and the Cerrado biome has played a pivotal role in this expansion. Because of the economic and agronomic challenges associated with the maize production as a second summer crop in this region, cover crops are gaining popularity as a strategy to diversify the agricultural system while enhancing soil health. This study assessed the benefits of single species of cover crops and a mix of cover crop species in between harvest seasons to the soybean grain yield and nematode suppression. The study was carried out for 3 years in two locations within the Cerrado biome. We evaluated six cover crop treatments after soybean cultivation: (1) Mix of cover crops (Pennisetum glaucum, Crotalaria spectabilis and Urochloa ruziziensis), (2) P. glaucum (Pearl millet), (3) C. spectabilis, (4) U. ruziziensis (Congo grass) (5) Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (Marandu palisadegrass) and (6) U. brizantha BRS Paiaguás (Paiaguás palisadegrass). Pennisetum glaucum and U. brizantha cv. Marandu produced highest amounts of biomass on a 3-year average. In one site, P. glaucum produced more biomass than other cover crops by 210%. Tropical grasses (U. ruziziensis, Marandu and Paiaguás), along with the cover crop mixture, exhibited intermediate biomass levels in the site with higher P. glaucum biomass production and did not differ from P. glaucum in the other site. Cover crops varied nutrient uptake depending on the species. Decomposition rates varied among cover crops as expected, with C. spectabilis decomposing rapidly and releasing substantial amounts nutrients, particularly nitrogen. In contrast, the cover crop mixture had a slower decomposition. The choice of cover crop significantly influenced soybean population and yield, with some variability across years and locations. The cover crop mixture consistently supported higher soybean populations and yields, highlighting its potential for enhancing soybean production, nutrient cycling and nematode suppression. It effectively reduced nematode abundance in soybean roots, highlighting its role in nematode management. Our findings emphasize the robustness and versatility of cover crop mixtures in mitigating weather variability across years and sites. They consistently performed well in terms of biomass production, nutrient uptake, soybean yields and nematode control. This study highlights the vital role of cover crops in the Cerrado ecosystem, enhancing soil health, crop productivity and environmental sustainability. The choice of cover crop species and mixtures offers a valuable tool for farmers seeking resilient and sustainable agricultural practices amid changing environmental conditions. © 2023 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Maintaining soil functions is crucial for human well-being, but there is a lack of integration between soil, water security, ecosystem services, and climate change. To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the São Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h−1) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0–5 cm: 115.9 cm h−1) than eucalyptus (0–5 cm: 36.4 cm h−1), rotational grazing (0–5 cm: 19.4 cm h−1), and extensive grazing (0–5 cm: 2.6 cm h−1), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos, popularly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a native tree of Brazil with exuberant flowering. It is used for urban afforestation and reforestation of degraded areas, and its wood is destined for several purposes. In order to develop vigorous plants after planting, it is essential to produce high-quality seedlings, which can be obtained using rhizobacteria. As renewable sources, rhizobacteria exhibit growth-promoting properties, facilitate nutrient uptake and/or solubilization, and contributes to the production of phytohormones, while also serving as pathogen controllers and mitigators of abiotic stress. These attributes collectively enable the establishment of a sustainable production system for producing vigorous and rapidly growing seedlings. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the production of H. chrysotrichus seedlings. The experimental design followed a completely randomized setup. The treatments consisted of microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Azospirillum brasilense) plus the absence of microorganisms-control; four repetitions and ten plants-per-plot. The parameters evaluated were shoot height; stem diameter; root length; shoot, root, and total dry matter; leaf number and leaf area, as well as chlorophyll content; minimum and maximum fluorescence; and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II; shoot height/stem diameter ratio and Dickson’s Quality Index. The B. amyloliquefaciens inoculation promoted an increase in seedling shoot height, stem diameter, root length, leaf area, shoot, root, and total dry matter and also increased the Dickson Quality Index. It can be concluded that B. amyloliquefaciens is the most efficient inoculant for producing golden trumpet tree seedlings, followed by A. brasilense. © 2024, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - The Cross River estuary is a coastal wetland in the south-eastern part of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with its hydrological cycle largely dependent on precipitation. The purpose of this study was to determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in water from selected wetlands in the Cross River estuary. Water samples were collected from the Ikang, Anantigha and Adiabo wetlands and the major GHGs were analysed using a gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. The mean concentration levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulphur oxide (SO2) were measured in the water samples for both seasons. There was a significant difference in concentrations of all the greenhouse gases in the water samples for both seasons. The exceptions were: SO2 in Adiabo, CO2 in Anantigha and N2O in Ikang, which showed insignificant differences for both seasons. The water CO2 concentrations from the Adiabo wetland recorded the largest contribution of greenhouse gas levels, ranging between 6.88 ± 2.22 ppm and 11.02 ± 2.52 ppm. These levels were in the range of those reported in the Congo basin. The variation in concentrations could be due to location, hydrological characteristics, nutrient load injection or the nitrification and denitrification processes of wetlands. © 2024 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Land degradation is a major issue for attainment of sustainable development in Eastern DR Congo. This study aims to assess and model the spatial pattern of land degradation vulnerability (LDV) in this region through the application of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and geospatial techniques by using the Kalehe territory as a case study. LDV has been defined as the resultant of three components: the exposure to erosion risk, the sensitivity associated with biophysical factors, and the adaptability associated with socioeconomic factors of vulnerability. These factors were weighted using the EasyAHP plugin and multisource open spatial data to obtain the LDV model. This model was validated using the frequency ratio of physical land degradation features. The LDV map was obtained through the application of the weighted overlay technique in QGIS. The results indicated that about 32% of the territory is prone to high to very high vulnerability, representing the hotspot of LDV. The developed model has an overall accuracy of 77.8% in predicting the area with high to very high LDV. Thus, it can be used during land conservation planning to identify the priority areas for implementation of landscape restoration initiatives at the territorial level in Eastern DR Congo. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - N2O emissions resulting from the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers and vinasse represent the main sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in sugar-energy sector. Conversely, the application of biochar in soils has been worldwide recognized as an strategy to mitigate N2O emissions, although little is known about their effects on soils under energy cane production. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar addition as a strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions in soil under energy cane cultivation, as well as to quantify the abundance of N2O-producing and N2O-reducing microbial guilds. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and four replications. The treatments were: i) no N fertilization (control); ii) N fertilization; iii) N fertilization plus vinasse; iv) N fertilization plus biochar; v) N fertilization plus vinasse plus biochar. All treatments (except control) were balanced to receive the same amount of nutrients. Biochar was added at a rate of 5 g kg−1 of soil. Soil N2O emissions were quantified by static chambers for 78 days, and soil sampling were performed to determine chemical and microbiological attributes, including functional genes of the nitrogen cycle (AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS, nosZI and nosZII) by real-time PCR. Results indicated that vinasse addition increased N2O emissions. Conversely, the application of biochar reduced N2O emissions associated with the application of N fertilizer (56 %) and N fertilizer + vinasse (41 %). The high N2O emissions observed in vinasse treatment were directly correlated with nitrifier microorganisms (AOB and AOA), indicating that nitrification should be the main pathway of N2O emissions in this treatment. The production of energy cane biomass was similar between N fertilizer treatments. High N2O emission intensities (mg N2O g biomass−1) were obtained in treatments with vinasse application. This study concluded that biochar is an effficient strategy to mitigate N2O emissions, providing the first insights into how biochar affects the microbial community associated with N2O emissions from soil under energy cane cultivation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Surface mining is inherently linked to climate change, but more precise monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is necessary. Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO2eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO2eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO2eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Peatlands, which cover approximately 7% of Indonesia's land surface, hold significant agricultural potential but require careful management for sustainability. The objective of this research is to assess the effects of land and water management on peat soil bulk density (BD) and subsidence in agricultural practices employing integrated water management. The study was conducted in Pulau Burung District, Riau Province, which is the only Nucleus and Smallholder Estate Scheme of coconut plantation in Indonesia. The plantation applied and managed an integrated water management technique called "Water Management Trinity" to regulate water levels during rainy and dry spells, ensuring optimal growth conditions and maintaining peat soil wetness. The results show no pattern differences in BD between the nucleus estate and smallholder estate, with values ranging from 0.10–0.19 g/cm3. It was observed that peat soil BD decreases with increasing depth. The annual subsidence rate is -1.56 cm. However, the BD has increased by 136% relative to the initial measurements in 1986, contributing to a slowdown in the progression of subsidence rates in recent years. The adoption of cover crop management, which enhances nutrient cycling processes in peat soil on the nucleus estate, and the transformation of farmers from conventional practices to apply cover crop management, have shown positive impacts on productivity. The application of sustainable management practices in coconut plantations demonstrates the potential for the sustainable use of peatlands, particularly in mitigating the high subsidence rates that are a primary concern in peatland agriculture. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Amazonia is believed to harbour the world’s most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat-covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

AB  - Quantifying spatial variations and trends in nighttime fires is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of fire dynamics. Traditional fire monitoring typically focuses on daytime observations, but controlling nocturnal fires poses unique challenges due to reduced visibility. While several studies have focused on examining global and regional fire trends, very few studies have focused on nighttime fires, particularly in South/Southeast Asian (S/SEA) countries. In this study, we analyzed nighttime vegetation fires in S/SEA using VIIRS I-band (375 m) data, including a comparison with Sentinel-3A SLSTR data. The results suggested that ~28.25% of total fires occurred at night in SA, and 18.98% in SEA. In SA, a statistically significant (p =< 0.05) increase in nighttime fires was observed in Bangladesh. India showed a positive trend in nighttime fires, while Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka exhibited negative trends; however, these results were not statistically significant. In SEA, we detected statistically significant (p =< 0.05) decreases in nighttime fires in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, with increases in Myanmar and the Philippines. Indonesia experienced the most substantial reduction in nighttime fires. Furthermore, VIIRS I-band detections were approximately 92–98 times higher than those of SLSTR-3A in S/SEA. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into nighttime fires and trends in S/SEA countries, which are useful for fire prevention, mitigation and management in the region. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Tropical mountainous regions are often identified as landslide hotspots with growing population pressure. Anthropogenic factors are assumed to play a role in the occurrence of landslides in these densely populated regions, yet the relative importance of these human-induced factors remains poorly documented. In this work, we aim to explore the impact of forest cover dynamics, roads and mining activities on the characteristics and causes of landslides in the rift flank west of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). To do so, we compile a comprehensive multi-temporal inventory of 2730 landslides. The landslides are of different types and are grouped into five categories that are adapted to study the impact of human activities on slope stability: old (pre-1950s) and recent (post-1950s) deep-seated landslides, shallow landslides, landslides associated with mining and landslides associated with road construction. We analyse the landslides according to this classification protocol via frequency-area statistics, frequency ratio distribution and logistic regression susceptibility assessment. We find that natural factors contributing to the cause of recent and old deep-seated landslides were either different or changed over time. Under similar topographic conditions, shallow landslides are more frequent, but of a smaller size, in areas where deforestation has occurred since the 1950s. We attribute this size reduction to the decrease in regolith cohesion due to forest loss, which allows for a smaller minimum critical area for landsliding. In areas that were already deforested in the 1950s, shallow landslides are less frequent, larger and occur on less steep slopes. This suggests a combined role between regolith availability and soil management practices that influence erosion and water infiltration. Mining activities increase the odds of landsliding. Landslides associated with mining and roads are larger than shallow landslides but smaller than the recent deep-seated instabilities, and they are controlled by environmental factors that are not present under natural conditions. Our analysis demonstrates the role of human activities on the occurrence of landslides in the Lake Kivu region. Overall, it highlights the need to consider this context when studying hillslope instability characteristics and distribution patterns in regions under anthropogenic pressure. Our work also highlights the importance of using landslide classification criteria adapted to the context of the Anthropocene.  © Copyright:

AB  - Interactions between humans and wildfires have increased in many regions over the last decades driven by climate and land-use changes. A shift towards more adaptive fire management and policies is urgently needed but remains difficult to achieve. Better understanding of public interest in wildfire can facilitate this transition, as the public is a key driver for policy decisions. We used Google Trends to assess temporal patterns (2004–2020) in public interest on wildfires worldwide and in five case study countries (Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal, USA). Public interest consistently shows a cyclic pattern with low background and short-lasting spikes during fire seasons and catastrophic events. Wildfires that receive the most interest worldwide are located in Western countries, especially the USA. There is usually high demand for news on wildfires when spikes in interest happen. Overall global interest in wildfire has risen twice: first for a short period in 2007–2008, concomitant to catastrophic wildfires in California, and again since 2017, probably triggered by a series of catastrophic fire events around the globe. Nevertheless, public interest in wildfire is low when compared with socioeconomically more costly earthquakes or hurricanes. The short and seasonal interest in wildfire may present an important obstacle to the implementation of wildfire mitigation policies that require year-round approaches. However, the fact that the public uses the internet to obtain basic knowledge about wildfire functioning and impacts, especially during the interest spikes, can facilitate targeting awareness campaigns. These could be not only about wildfires but also about broader related environmental issues. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical peatlands cycle and store large amounts of carbon in their soil and biomass1–5. Climate and land-use change alters greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of tropical peatlands, but the magnitude of these changes remains highly uncertain6–19. Here we measure net ecosystem exchanges of carbon dioxide, methane and soil nitrous oxide fluxes between October 2016 and May 2022 from Acacia crassicarpa plantation, degraded forest and intact forest within the same peat landscape, representing land-cover-change trajectories in Sumatra, Indonesia. This allows us to present a full plantation rotation GHG flux balance in a fibre wood plantation on peatland. We find that the Acacia plantation has lower GHG emissions than the degraded site with a similar average groundwater level (GWL), despite more intensive land use. The GHG emissions from the Acacia plantation over a full plantation rotation (35.2 ± 4.7 tCO2-eq ha−1 year−1, average ± standard deviation) were around two times higher than those from the intact forest (20.3 ± 3.7 tCO2-eq ha−1 year−1), but only half of the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 emission factor (EF)20 for this land use. Our results can help to reduce the uncertainty in GHG emissions estimates, provide an estimate of the impact of land-use change on tropical peat and develop science-based peatland management practices as nature-based climate solutions. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Characterization of regrowing forests is vital for understanding forest dynamics to assess the impacts on carbon stocks and to support sustainable forest management. Although remote sensing is a key tool for understanding and monitoring forest dynamics, the use of exclusively remotely sensed data to explore the effects of different variables on regrowing forests across all biomes in Brazil has rarely been investigated. Here, we analyzed how environmental and human factors affect regrowing forests. Based on Brazil's secondary forest age map, 3060 locations disturbed between 1984 and 2018 were sampled, interpreted and analyzed in different biomes. We interpreted the time since disturbance for the sampled pixels in Google Earth Engine. Elevation, slope, climatic water deficit (CWD), the total Nitrogen of soil, cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements and fire frequency were analyzed in their importance for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree cover derived from global forest aboveground biomass map and tree cover map, respectively. Results show that time since disturbance interpreted from satellite time series is the most important predictor for characterizing AGB and tree cover of regrowing forests. AGB increased with increasing time since disturbance, surrounding tree cover, soil total N, slope, distance to roads, distance to settlements and decreased with larger fire frequency, CWD and CEC of soil. Tree cover increased with larger time since disturbance, soil total N, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements, slope and decreased with increasing elevation and CWD. These results emphasize the importance of remotely sensing products as key opportunities to improve the characterization of forest regrowth and to reduce data gaps and uncertainties related to forest carbon sink estimation. Our results provide a better understanding of regional forest dynamics, toward developing and assessing effective forest-related restoration and climatic mitigation strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Research on the contribution of forests to local livelihoods has so far had a strong focus on quantifying the monetary value of forest-derived products and services. In this paper, we move beyond monetary valuation and integrate the less tangible and sometimes culturally complex dimensions through which forests support local livelihoods. We look at four local contexts in the Brazilian, Bolivian and Ecuadorian Amazon, which differ markedly in terms of their biophysical, sociocultural and geopolitical settings. Combining economic and anthropological data, we used quantitative and qualitative methods, and measures of the ecological impacts of local forest uses. Quantitative analyses drew on datasets from 48 communities, and 510 households, while the qualitative analyses relied on semi-structured interviews with 78 families in 22 communities. Forest-based livelihoods exhibited complex portfolios, diversified production systems, seasonal variation of activities, and different specialization strategies. Beyond a source of subsistence and cash incomes, forests were locally valued by people across all sites in terms of identities, worldviews, territorial attachment, governance, and conservation. Populations with a longer history of interactions with the environment displayed more complex forest-related cultural systems, but even among people who had migrated into the forest in a more recent historical period, forest-based self-cultural identification was evident. At all sites, forests were unanimously recognized as critical to people's health and wellbeing, despite substantial differences in local histories, policy and market environments. The findings underscore the persistent importance of non-economic values of forests as both Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups constantly adapt their forest and land use practices based on transcultural exchange and changing conditions. A focus on economic value as the rationale for forest conservation disregards the striking resilience of cultural values in promoting forest conservation and use by diverse local and Indigenous communities, especially when supported by favorable policies and markets. © 2023

AB  - Rigorous impact evaluations of local REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests, while well-being impacts have been mixed. However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27–44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined – yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing (‘set-aside’): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Resprouting is a widespread mechanism through which woody plants recover from biomass loss and/or abiotic stress, particularly in fire-prone ecosystems. Here, we assess the resprouting responses to coppicing exhibited by woody plant species in a human-modified landscape of Caatinga dry forest, in the northeast of Brazil. A total of 150 resprouts from 19 species (trees and shrubs) were experimentally coppiced. Shoot performance (number of new shoots, length, diameter and coppicing capacity) and mortality were monitored through a 15-mo period. Resprout diameter, chronic disturbance and environmental factors (rainfall, soil fertility and light availability) were assessed as explanatory variables. Of the144 coppiced resprouts, 72.2 % produced new shoots, with a total of 217 new shoots across the 19 focal species and emerged vigorously across all resprout types (root, root collar and stem). Shoot density reached 1.5 ± 1.2 shoots per resprout, with a length of 11.33 ± 10.1 cm and a diameter of 0.2 ± 0.1 cm. When pooling all new shoots across species, resprout diameter was found to have a positive effect on shoot number, length, diameter and coppicing capacity. At species level, resprout diameter was also the most important predictor. However, chronic disturbance had both negative and positive effects on some performance indicators of some species, as did rainfall, soil fertility and leaf area index. Finally, mortality rate was not affected by any of the explanatory variables assessed, neither at species nor community level. Our findings suggest that in human-modified landscapes of Caatinga dry forest, woody flora probably contain a large number of resprouting species (dominant species, in some cases), which are able to vigorously produce new shoots in response to biomass loss. Furthermore, we found shoot performance to be mediated by variables that affect plant growth. Although the Caatinga dry forest flora did not evolve in the presence of fire, resprouting is expected to play a key role in its regeneration and dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests, leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, controlling these super-dominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species. Native clonal ferns from the Pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires. Although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed, the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown. Here, we assessed to what extent removing the above-ground biomass of the shade-intolerant Pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane Atlantic forests in south-east Brazil. In four sites dominated by P. arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots: (1) control without interference, (2) cutting twice per year, (3) cutting twice per year plus tree planting, (4) cutting three times per year, and (5) cutting three times per year plus tree planting. Over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored P. arachnoideum height, rhizome and above-ground biomass, as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank. We also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees. Tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs, whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 %. After two years, the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in above-ground biomass (1 to 0.1 kg/m2) and abundance (80 to 15 %) of P. arachnoideum. Planted trees exhibited low survival (47 %) rates and growth (30 cm/year), and hence had no effect on the dominance of P. arachnoideum. Treatments did not affect rhizome biomass, suggesting that P. arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued. Although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration, trees were rare in both the established vegetation (less than 10 %) and seed bank (less than 0.3 seeds/dm3). Conversely, under three annual cuts the African grass M. minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation (5 to 25 %) and seed bank (1 to 4 seeds/dm3). Our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of P. arachnoideum in Atlantic forests. However, its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration, impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses. Therefore, planting fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded Neotropical forests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In times of unprecedented climate change, ecological restoration efforts have a strong focus on forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Grasslands, in contrast, remain relatively neglected in global restoration policies. Concurrently, we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis—it is estimated that 1 million species are globally threatened with extinction. Here, we present analyses from central Europe and southern Brazil that show that the majority of our endangered plant species are in fact found in open ecosystems. Using Germany as an example, we show that we could reduce plant extinction risk by up to 82% if we restore open, grassy ecosystems. This also holds true for southern Brazil, where grassland species constitute the single largest share of endangered species, but where grassy ecosystems continue to be systematically neglected by restoration policies. We further expand on our biodiversity argument to include the role that grassland restoration can play in mitigating climate change. We posit that ramping up grassland restoration efforts may not only be our best bet to bend the curve of biodiversity loss, but it will also make a critical contribution to the resilience of ecosystems in the dynamic decades to come. It is time for grassland restoration to receive higher priority in global restoration efforts and policy. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The different agroforestry management can perform different potentials for carbon sequestration. The study aimed to estimate the potential of carbon stocks in various types of agroforestry in the last 20 years in Senaru area, the sub district of Bayan, Northern Lombok. The study was conducted from June to August 2022. Different types of agroforestry managed on entisols include mahogany based agroforestry (Swietenia mahagoni), Cacao-based agroforestry (Theobroma cacao), Coffee-based agroforestry (Robusta Coffee), Sengon based- agroforestry (Albizia chinensis), and Porang-based agroforestry (Amorphophallus muelleri). Samples for measuring above ground biomass at each agroforestry were carried out on plot area of 20 m x 20 m. Samples for soil organic carbon (SOC) was carried out by collecting 4 composite soil samples at each type of agroforestry at soil depth of 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm. In addition to the soil organic-C, measurements were also made on soil bulk density, total porosity, and soil texture. The results of the study showed that the total carbon stocks varied under different types of agroforestry. Mahogany based agroforestry produced the highest total carbon stocks, 440.64 ton.ha-1, and subsequently, it was followed by sengon-based agroforestry, coffee, cocoa and porang with values of 371.54 ton ha-1, 305.33 ton ha-1, 166.15 ton ha-1 and 153.93 ton ha-1 respectively. Thus, to support sustainable agroforestry management in this area, it is important to consider the timber tree stands that potentially produce high biomass as well as the need to improve the diversity of high biomass vegetation in areas with low vegetation density. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Logged forests cover four million square kilometers of the tropics, capturing carbon more rapidly than temperate forests and harboring rich biodiversity. Restoring these forests is essential to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet monitoring tropical forest recovery is challenging. We track the abundance of early-successional species in a forest restoration concession in Indonesia. If the species are carefully chosen, they can be used as an indicator of restoration progress. We present SLIC-UAV, a new pipeline for processing Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)to map early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline comprises: (a) a field verified approach for manually labeling species; (b) automatic segmentation of imagery into “superpixels” and (c) machine learning classification of species based on both spectral and textural features. Creating superpixels massively reduces the dataset's dimensionality and enables the use of textural features, which improve classification accuracy. In addition, this approach is flexible with regards to the spatial distribution of training data. This allowed us to be flexible in the field and collect high-quality training data with the help of local experts. The accuracy ranged from 74.3% for a four-species classification task to 91.7% when focusing only on the key early-succesional species. We then extended these models across 100 hectares of forest, mapping species dominance and forest condition across the entire restoration project.

AB  - Inundation dynamics are the primary control on greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. Situated in the central Congo Basin, the Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex. However, our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in its water levels is limited. By addressing this gap, we can quantify the relationship between the Cuvette Centrale’s water levels and greenhouse gas emissions, and further provide a baseline from which deviations caused by climate or land-use change can be observed, and their impacts understood. We present here a novel approach that combines satellite-derived rainfall, evapotranspiration and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate spatial and temporal changes in water level across a sub-region of the Cuvette Centrale. Our key outputs are a map showing the spatial distribution of rainfed and flood-prone locations and a daily, 100 m resolution map of peatland water levels. This map is validated using satellite altimetry data and in situ water table data from water loggers. We determine that 50% of peatlands within our study area are largely rainfed, and a further 22.5% are somewhat rainfed, receiving hydrological input mostly from rainfall (directly and via surface/sub-surface inputs in sloped areas). The remaining 27.5% of peatlands are mainly situated in riverine floodplain areas to the east of the Congo River and between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. The mean amplitude of the water level across our study area and over a 20-month period is 22.8 ± 10.1 cm to 1 standard deviation. Maximum temporal variations in water levels occur in the riverine floodplain areas and in the inter-fluvial region between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. Our results show that spatial and temporal changes in water levels can be successfully mapped over tropical peatlands using the pattern of net water input (rainfall minus evapotranspiration, not accounting for run-off) and L-band SAR data. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The COP21 Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) have proven to be milestones in the operationalization of climate action at the country-level, particularly in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. In Brazil, AFOLU-related NDC actions in its first version envisaged the elimination of, for instance: illegal deforestation in the Amazon region, the restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of severely degraded lands, and the substantial expansion of sustainably produced biofuels by 2030. While Brazilian Government commitment to these NDC targets soon vanished, a specific analytical question concerns as to how far sustainable land use scenarios can contribute to non-climate benefits (i.e., socioeconomic development) despite their internal challenges of harmonizing them with environmental protection and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we analyse the potential socioeconomic and environmental synergies and trade-offs in NDC implementation, given the possibility of the demand for land in Brazil increase due to agricultural and livestock expansion. We focus our analysis on GDP growth, income distribution, and food security. We do so by integrating land-use with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and running policy scenarios, emulating different levels of NDC and development policy implementation. Our analysis helps us to understand how social and economic outcomes do change under varying levels of commitment by decision-makers. It shows that NDC implementation in Brazil is preferable to a business-as-usual development pathway, particularly when climate change is taken into consideration. While GDP and household income appear unaffected by NDC implementation, reducing the pressure over Amazon deforestation along with other social benefits appears under more stringent NDC implementation. Those results are particularly important given the significant upward trend in Amazon deforestation recorded in the last few years and the loss of purchasing power of low-income classes observed since 2015 in Brazil. In the AFOLU sector, NDC implementation, as in its first version, could thus act as entry points for alternative development pathways. For instance, such as the ones discussed under green economy or low carbon growth paradigms-although, possible trade-offs between agricultural and other sectors will still need to be closely monitored. © 2023, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services for people and nature, including climate change mitigation. This study analyzed species diversity, biomass value, and estimated carbon stocks in mangrove forest ecosystems on Belitung Island, Indonesia. The data collection method is carried out by creating a linear plot consisting of several circular subplots. Data analysis was carried out to determine the frequency, density, important value index, biomass (above-ground and below-ground biomass), and carbon content. The results of research on mangrove ecosystems on Belitung Island obtained ten species of mangroves dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume found in all research sites. The density of mangroves in the four locations (>1,500 trees/ha) is very dense. In contrast, the location in Juru Seberang (1,349 trees/ha) is categorized as moderate because it is the location of previous reforestation. Rhizophora apiculata has an important value index at the tree (161.24%) and sapling (149.24%) levels. Mangroves on Belitung Island have a total biomass value (225.08 t ha-1), estimated carbon content (112.54 t C ha-1), and carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption of 413.02 t CO2 ha-1. Sustainable coastal ecosystem management can significantly reduce carbon emissions from the land use sector and maintain ecosystem services in these coastal habitats, considering Belitung Island as one of the archipelago areas. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - This study looked at the potential of thermal comfort provided to animals by four different Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) native trees, as well as their potential for carbon sink. The evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020, which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables. The Mean Radiant Temperature (TMR, °C) was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees, and from that, the Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W m−2) was calculated as an index of thermal comfort. Solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct, diffuse, and reflected components (W m−2), and carbon stock from trees biomass for CO2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native Cerrado tree species. The shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures, to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals, with an average reduction respectively equal to 1.3 °C and 6.4 °C. This represents a significant difference compared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species (P < 0.05), reflecting in lower values of TMR and RHL in the shaded area provided by each species. Carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 8.85 Mg per tree. These results demonstrate the great potential for native tree species in the Cerrado biome to be used in agroforestry systems to provide higher levels of thermal comfort to animals and to combat climate change through their aptitude of CO2 sink. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The application of biochar from agro-industrial residues of the Amazon is a key strategy to optimize the use of phosphorus (P) in agriculture and provide the proper management of these materials. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the chemical constituents of biochars from açaí seeds (BA), Brazil nut shells (BN) and palm kernel cake (BK) with phosphorus adsorption to identify the main properties that control this process and the thermochemical stability of carbon (C). Biochars were produced under slow pyrolysis (3.33 ºC min–1) at 700 ºC and evaluated regarding their physicochemical properties, elemental composition and maximum P adsorption capacity (qm). The interrelationship between the properties of the biochars was described by multivariate techniques: factor analysis (FA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. The multivariate approach allowed the analysis of the properties of biochars associated with qm and provided the differentiation between the biochars derived from different agro-industrial residues. FA and CCA indicated a high association (r ≥ 0.93; p < 0.05) of qm with ash content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and nitrogen (N) content. Therefore, small increments in these attributes can cause variation in the rate of P adsorption. The heatmap allowed the identification of greater similarities between BA and BN; and greater contrast between qm with the aromaticity indices H/C and O/C and the polarity index (O + N)/C. Our results indicate that these biochars have the potential to adsorb P, increase the thermochemical stability of C in soil and represent a sustainable alternative for waste management of eastern Amazon.

AB  - The Lower Santa Cruz River Basin Study (LSCRB Study) is a collaborative effort of regional and statewide water management stakeholders working with the US Bureau of Reclamation under the auspices of the 2009 SECURE Water Act. The impacts of climate change, land use, and population growth on projected water supply in the LSCRB were evaluated to (1) identify projected water supply and demand imbalances and (2) develop adaptation strategies to proactively respond over the next 40 years. A multi-step hydroclimate modeling and risk assessment process was conducted to assess a range of futures in terms of temperature, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration, with a particular focus on implications for ecosystem health. Key hydroclimate modeling process decisions were informed by ongoing multi-stakeholder engagement. To incorporate the region’s highly variable precipitation pattern, the study used a numerical “weather generator” to develop ensembles of precipitation and temperature time series for input to surface hydrology modeling efforts. Hydroclimate modeling outcomes consistently included increasing temperatures, and generated information related to precipitation responses (season length and timing, precipitation amount) considered useful for evaluating potential ecosystem impacts. A range of risks was identified using the hydroclimate modeling outputs that allowed for development of potential adaptation strategies. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Occurrence of more frequent events of prolonged periods of low rainfall (drought) in worldwide cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) production zones has not only compromised productivity of small farmers but also crop survival. This study aimed to evaluate how and to what extent cacao tree mortality in dry years is related with variations in soil and physiographic features. The rate of mortality of cacao trees cultivated under an agroforestry system was evaluated over three periods (1994–1995, 2009–2013, and 2015–2019) on 36 plots of a farm in Bahia, Brazil, which has a wide diversity of soils and is established in a region with a subhumid to dry climate. Correlation analyses (single and multiple), cluster analysis, and Tukey tests were performed. The explanatory variables studied were the attributes of two soil layers (physical, mineralogical, and chemical), the diagnostic horizon, and the physiographic attributes (slope, terrain orientation in relation to the sun, and crop shading). The edaphic attributes most related to cacao tree mortality were physical (granulometry, porosity, and density) and mineralogical (Ki), mainly in the subsurface layer. The lowest mortality was observed in Oxisols and on slopes facing south and east. It was possible to establish recommend limits of the most suitable edaphic attributes to ensure greater survival of cacao trees cultivated in regions subject to recurrent water deficit similar to the conditions of this study. These findings can be used to guide farmers on how to mitigate the effect of drought. © 2022 The Authors. Agronomy Journal © 2022 American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - While existing moratoria in Indonesia and Malaysia should preclude continued large-scale expansion of palm oil production into new areas of South-East Asian tropical peatland, existing plantations in the region remain a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon due to drainage driven decomposition of peatland soils. Previous studies have made clear the direct link between drainage depth and peat carbon decomposition and significant reductions in the emission rate of CO2 can be made by raising water tables nearer to the soil surface. However, the impact of such changes on palm fruit yield is not well understood and will be a critical consideration for plantation managers. Here we take advantage of very high frequency, long-term monitoring of canopy-scale carbon exchange at a mature oil palm plantation in Malaysian Borneo to investigate the relationship between drainage level and photosynthetic uptake and consider the confounding effects of light quality and atmospheric vapour pressure deficit. Canopy modelling from our dataset demonstrated that palms were exerting significantly greater stomatal control at deeper water table depths (WTD) and the optimum WTD for photosynthesis was found to be between 0.3 and 0.4 m below the soil surface. Raising WTD to this level, from the industry typical drainage level of 0.6 m, could increase photosynthetic uptake by 3.6 % and reduce soil surface emission of CO2 by 11 %. Our study site further showed that despite being poorly drained compared to other planting blocks at the same plantation, monthly fruit bunch yield was, on average, 14 % greater. While these results are encouraging, and at least suggest that raising WTD closer to the soil surface to reduce emissions is unlikely to produce significant yield penalties, our results are limited to a single study site and more work is urgently needed to confirm these results at other plantations. © 2022

AB  - There are limited data for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from smallholder agricultural systems in tropical peatlands, with data for non-CO2 emissions from human-influenced tropical peatlands particularly scarce. The aim of this study was to quantify soil CH4 and N2O fluxes from smallholder agricultural systems on tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia and assess their environmental controls. The study was carried out in four regions in Malaysia and Indonesia. CH4 and N2O fluxes and environmental parameters were measured in cropland, oil palm plantation, tree plantation and forest. Annual CH4 emissions (in kg CH4 ha−1 year−1) were: 70.7 ± 29.5, 2.1 ± 1.2, 2.1 ± 0.6 and 6.2 ± 1.9 at the forest, tree plantation, oil palm and cropland land-use classes, respectively. Annual N2O emissions (in kg N2O ha−1 year−1) were: 6.5 ± 2.8, 3.2 ± 1.2, 21.9 ± 11.4 and 33.6 ± 7.3 in the same order as above, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were strongly determined by water table depth (WTD) and increased exponentially when annual WTD was above −25 cm. In contrast, annual N2O emissions were strongly correlated with mean total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in soil water, following a sigmoidal relationship, up to an apparent threshold of 10 mg N L−1 beyond which TDN seemingly ceased to be limiting for N2O production. The new emissions data for CH4 and N2O presented here should help to develop more robust country level ‘emission factors’ for the quantification of national GHG inventory reporting. The impact of TDN on N2O emissions suggests that soil nutrient status strongly impacts emissions, and therefore, policies which reduce N-fertilisation inputs might contribute to emissions mitigation from agricultural peat landscapes. However, the most important policy intervention for reducing emissions is one that reduces the conversion of peat swamp forest to agriculture on peatlands in the first place. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The misappropriation of sustainable forest programs by local communities and the under-utilization of their knowledge are major impediments to the mitigation of deforestation. Within this context, participation has become a principle used in almost all interventions. It is important to evaluate the practices in this area to ensure better involvement of local communities. This survey examined the perception and participation of local communities in the management of miombo woodlands, based on semi-structured questionnaire surveys involving 945 households in 5 villages in the Lubumbashi rural area. The results reveal that local communities perceive soil fertility loss and deforestation as major environmental challenges in their area. This perception remains largely influenced by their socio-demographic factors such as respondents’ age, seniority in the villages, and level of education. To mitigate deforestation, the rare actions of provincial public services and non-governmental organizations are focused on the sustainable exploitation of miombo woodlands through the development of simple management plans, reforestation, and forest control. These activities are sparse and poorly inclusive of scientific findings and the priorities of local communities. These justify poor community participation, particularly in the actions of provincial public services. For a better appropriation of sustainable forest management plans and to reinforce miombo woodlands’ resilience to anthropogenic pressures, based on these findings, we recommend a concerted and inclusive approach to forest planning. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Water-driven erosion associated with the transport and deposition of sediments in watersheds may lead to contamination problems causing significant damage to land and infrastructure. The key factors that influence erosive processes are well known and include the precipitation rate, terrain topography, soil type, and vegetation cover. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) considers these factors and may be used to identify areas susceptible to soil erosion and to estimate soil loss and sediment transport and deposition. To corroborate this assumption, real data on rill erosion and sediment transport from the Mogi Guaçu River Basin in southeastern Brazil were used to validate SWAT estimates. The study shows that the model is able to identify soil-eroded areas and replicate the scale and variation patterns of sediment production, although not with great precision. Hence, it can successfully be used for prioritizing areas that require action and for evaluating alternative soil management and conservation practices to mitigate erosive processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Underutilized Fruit Trees (UFTs) are a group of fruit trees with high potential but underutilized. Some fruit has been identified in Urug Village, but this village was hit by a natural disaster, i.e., a flood and landslide in early 2020 that damaged the location where UFTs grew, threatening the existence of UFTs genetic resources. Therefore, a systematic and integrated effort is needed to maintain UFTs biodiversity. This study aims to discover how to cultivate UFTs by the indigenous peoples in Urug Village, document the location where UFTs grow, and analyze index vegetation using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Using the combined method of Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with 16 indigenous people, in-depth interviews with 19 indigenous people, and field observations, this study shows that there are 53 individuals of UFTs from 13 species found in several areas in Urug Village. Indigenous people have a unique way of cultivating UFT, starting from tree selection, preparation of planting sites, tree planting, and fruit tree care. However, more than 60% of UFT was found in the moderate vegetation index. The challenges of UFTs cultivation in Urug Village are changes in fruit consumption patterns, degradation of local knowledge, lack of information about the nutritional and vitamin content of UFTs, land use change, climate change, and the low involvement of both central and regional governments in cultivating UFTs. Thus, changes in consumer and government perceptions, and increased research on UFT are needed to address the challenges of cultivating UFT. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - There is a need for greater knowledge about the medium-and long-term effects of prescribed fire management on soil in ecosystems prone to wildfires and more vulnerable to climate change. This study examined the short-and medium-term effects of prescribed fire on soil chemical properties and chemical fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in two positions of the landscape in a high-elevation grassland environment. The ecosystem is located in the mountain peaks of southeastern Brazil associated with the Atlantic Forest biome. Prescribed fire was conducted in 2017 to reduce understory vegetation and thus prevent potential severe wildfires. Soil samples were collected at the layers of 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m, at eight composite sampling. The composite samples were collected on five different occasions: before the prescribed fire, and 10, 30, 90, and 240 days after the prescribed fire. Soil chemical properties, total organic carbon, labile C, and chemical fractionation of SOM were analyzed. All soil properties investigated were affected by the prescribed fire, with variations in landscape position, duration of effect, and soil layer. In the backslope area, the medium-term effect of fire was negative and induced soil degradation and induced soil degradation. In the footslope area, the system showed greater resilience to the effects of fire, as indicated by the recovery of the soil’s chemical properties. These results can help assess the suitability of controlled burning of vegetation for managing risks of fire in mountainous regions, such as high-elevation grasslands. © 2023, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - Small-scale gold mining activities in Indonesia still use amalgamation techniques, which have the potential to cause mercury (Hg) pollution and affect the quality and number of microorganisms. Mercury-resistant bacteria can survive and adapt to mercury-exposed environments and can be developed as bioremediation agents. The bioremediation activity of these bacteria can be increased through immobilization using biochar. The results of observations of physicochemical qualities in three samples in the mining area, showed significant differences. The TOC in the rhizosphere soil sample of Calliandra calothyrsus L. showed the significantly highest value at 14.5%, and the pH of the three samples indicated acidity and exhibited no difference (p<0.05). The highest concentration measured in the tailing sample was 9.9 ng/g (p<0.05). The number of heterotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere soil was the highest at 7.2 × 108 CFU/g. On the other hand, the number of mercury-resistant bacteria in the tailing sample showed the highest value of 6.3 × 103 CFU/g. In the selection based on the toxicity profile of 30 mercury-resistant bacteria obtained, the highest results were observed in the LMP1B5 bacterial isolate from the river sediment, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 225 and 250 mg/L, respectively. Polyphasic identification based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics using the 16S rRNA gene showed that the bacterial isolate was identified as Escherichia fergusonii. The growth and mercury removal activity of E. fergusonii LMP1B5 increased by 21% and 52%, respectively, after the immobilization with biochar. Thus, immobilized E. fergusonii LMP1B5 was effective in removing mercury pollutants. © Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management.All rights reserved

AB  - We assessed the understory herb-layer species composition in response to tree vegetation and its associated environmental factors in the reforested area of the Kulon Progo Community Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The understory herb-layer composition among different stand types, including Pinus (PN), Aleurites-Swietenia (AS), Swietenia-Acacia (SA), Melaleuca-Acacia (MA) and Tectona-Dalbergia (TD), was compared using some comparison analyses. The influence of tree vegetation characteristics and associated environmental factors on the understory herb-layer species was analyzed by employing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Our result showed variation in understory herb-layer species composition despite equality in richness and diversity indices. Among all stand types, the MA stand showed fewer shade-tolerant species, and the TD stand exhibited the smallest number of shade-intolerant species. Seedling availability also varied between AS and MA, which contained fewer seedling species. One of the main species in the two stands did not even regenerate. Moreover, all indicator species in MA were shade-intolerant species with invasive characteristics, while those in TD were shade-tolerant and semi-shade-tolerant species. CCA showed that stand types held an important role in the herb-layer species composition, where the number of shade-tolerant and seedling species commonly native to forest were directly proportional to tree canopy coverage, silt proportion in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon yet inversely proportional to below-stand utilization. In contrast, the number of shade-intolerant species had positive correlation to below-stand utilization and inversely to other correlated factors. Our study also indicated the possibility of tree vegetation controlling several environmental factors, where the increase in canopy coverage was followed by an increasing proportion of silt in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon, as well as a decreasing percentage of below-stand utilization. Accordingly, we recommend tree species enrichment with dense-canopy trees and adaptive management of below-stand utilization for better forest development and tree regeneration. This finding provides important knowledge for evaluation and improvement in the ecological restoration of degraded forests. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Various sectors are involved in achieving Indonesia’s Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), including Forestry and Other Land Uses (FOLU) sector. Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) implementation by forest concessionaires (PBPHs) enormously contributes to land-based mitigation activities, primarily at the local level. One of the SFM activities is forest enrichment with Intensive Silvicultural (SILIN) technique using Shorea leprosula Miq. to enhance carbon stock and sequestration. This study was conducted in PT Sarmiento Parakantja Timber (PT Sarpatim) in Central Kalimantan and used the measurement data from 32 purposive sampling plots. Each pl ot was 40 × 40 m in size, constructed under three different SILIN patterns (conventional strip, effective strip, and gap) as well as natural forest stands. This study found that SILIN gap pattern had higher carbon stock and sequestration potential, compared to the natural forest (reference) stands, and reached a net sink condition after 30 years. For the stands of SILIN conventional and effective strip patterns, the carbon stocks were lower than the reference stand, even when the vegetation aged 30 years. PBPHs applying SILIN technique as part of the SFM and the mitigation actions demonstrate an enhanced carbon stock and sequestration. This effort supports Indonesia’s Enhanced NDC target and FOLU Net Sink 2030. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - The inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in climate mitigation pathways is critical and can be reached by assessing their consequences through the deployment of appropriate indicators to that end. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools for understanding possible impacts caused by adopting new policies. We investigate terrestrial biodiversity trends (life on land: SDG 15) for three different climate mitigation scenarios for Brazil: (1) A scenario compatible with a world that maintains its current policies with current deforestation rates in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes; (2) A scenario in which Brazil fulfils its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); and (3) A scenario compatible with a world that limits warming to 1.5°C. We use the Brazilian Land-Use and Energy System model (BLUES), a national IAM, to show the implications of the transitions involved in the above-mentioned scenarios for the country up to 2050. We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses. We conclude that Brazil has the opportunity to align its biodiversity and climate goals through nature-based solutions (NBS), such as forest conservation, restoration, pasture recovery, and the use of crop-pasture and agroforestry systems. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: There is an immense debate about the factors that could limit the adoption of agroforestry systems. However, one of the most important is the generation of scientific information that supports the viability and benefits of the proposed techniques. Statistical analysis: This work used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling method to identify and interpret scientific information on topics in relation to existing categories in a set of documents. It also used the HJ-Biplot method to determine the relationship between the analyzed topics, taking into consideration the years under study. Results: A review of the literature was conducted in this study and a total of 9794 abstracts of scientific articles published between 1993 and 2022 were obtained. The United States, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Germany were the five countries that published the largest number of studies about agroforestry, particularly soil organic carbon, which was the most studied case. The five more frequently studied topics were: soil organic carbon, adoption of agroforestry practices, biodiversity, climatic change global policies, and carbon and climatic change. Conclusion: the LDA and HJ-Biplot statistical methods are useful tools for determining topicality in text analysis in agroforestry and related topics. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Mangrove deforestation by land use conversions is the greatest threat to the conservation of coastal ecosystems, ranking Brazil as a country with high gross annual CO2 emissions. Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and São Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in São Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region. Overall, the net carbon sequestration was approximately 925,393 Mg CO2e and 287,130 Mg CO2e, in Santos and São Vicente, respectively, over a period from 1988 to 2050. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify soil carbon stock and accumulation in mangroves along an urban coastal landscape in Brazil and emphasizes the current and future role of mangroves in climate change mitigation. Our findings can support the development of public policies for mangrove conservation and restoration actions to mitigate climate impacts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Indonesia’s vast forested areas have the potential to serve as a crucial source of livelihood for local communities. However, the current contributions of these forests to community livelihoods are significantly underutilized in comparison to their potential. This study evaluates the financial performance and sustainability of community forest-based businesses operating around the forest management area of the Lakitan-Bukit Cogong forest management unit (LBC FMU). Data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with the key informants through purposive sampling. Financial viability analysis and a qualitative approach were used to assess the feasibility of the businesses. The findings revealed that all businesses show positive values for all financial indicators. From profit estimation and value-added distribution, all products are shown to be feasible. Concerning the value and supply chain, the rubber-processing industry has a remarkable flow. Moreover, small forest enterprises (SFEs) highlight natural capital optimization through multitudinous derivatives of products that could support a substantial regenerative economy, including citronella essential oil, native honeybees, rubber-based product, biochar, skewers, and liquid smoke. In addition, the multidimensional scaling and rapid appraisal for forest (MDS-RAPForest) approach generates a result based on multiple dimensions (ecology, economics, social and human resources, and institutional and administrative dimensions) showing that overall, SFEs are categorized as sufficient/quite sustainable. Furthermore, mainstreaming adaptable forest-based enterprises, jurisdiction approaches, and cross-production system strategies are also discussed. Our findings suggest that sustainable NTFP-based activities within a community context can be facilitated through interconnected market systems, appropriate price regulations, and support from stakeholders and legal frameworks. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study examined the application of co-benefit-type wastewater treatment technology in the fish-processing industry. Given that there was a dearth of information on fish-processing industrial wastewater in Indonesia, site surveys were conducted. For the entire fish-processing industry throughout the country, the dissemination rate of wastewater treatment facilities was less than 50%. Using a co-benefit approach, a real-scale swim-bed technology (SBT) and a system combining an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with SBT (ABR–SBT) were installed in a fishmeal processing factory in Bali, Indonesia, and the wastewater system process performance was evaluated. In a business-as-usual scenario, the estimated chemical oxygen demand load and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wastewater from the Indonesian fish-processing industry were 33 000 tons per year and 220 000 tons of equivalent CO2 per year, respectively. On the other hand, the GHG emissions in the co-benefit scenarios of the SBT system and ABR–SBT system were 98 149 and 26 720 tons per year, respectively. Therefore, introducing co-benefit-type wastewater treatment to Indonesia's fish-processing industry would significantly reduce pollution loads and GHG emissions. © 2023 Hohai University

AB  - Designing multispecies systems with suitable climatic affinity and identifying species' vulnerability under human-driven climate change are current challenges to achieve successful adaptation of natural systems. To address this problem, we need to (1) identify groups of species with climatic similarity under climate scenarios and (2) identify areas with high conservation value under predicted climate change. To recognize species with similar climatic niche requirements that can be grouped for mixed cropping in Brazil, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs) and Spearman's ρ for overlap. We also used prioritization algorithms to map areas of high conservation value using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) to assess mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2061–2080) climate change impacts. We identified 15 species groups with finer climatic affinities at different times depicted on hierarchical clustering dendrograms, which can be combined into agroecological agroforestry systems. Furthermore, we highlight the climatically suitable areas for these groups of species, thus providing an outlook of where different species will need to be planted over time to be conserved. In addition, we observed that climate change is predicted to modify the spatial association of these groups under different future climate scenarios, causing a mean negative change in species climatic similarity of 9.5% to 13.7% under SSP2-4.5 scenario and 9.5% to 10.5% under SSP5-8.5, for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide a framework for agroforestry conservation. The groups of species with finer climatic affinities identified and the climatically suitable areas can be combined into agroecological productive systems, and provide an outlook of where different species may be planted over time. In addition, the conservation priority zones displaying high climate stability for each species individually and all at once can be incorporated into Brazil's conservation plans by policymakers to prioritize specific sites. Lastly, we urge policymakers, conservation organizations and donors to promote interventions involving farmers and local communities, since the species' evaluated have proven to maintain landscapes with productive forest fragments and can be conserved in different Brazilian ecosystems. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Peatlands only cover a small fraction of the global land surface (∼3%) but store large amounts of carbon (∼600 GtC). Drainage of peatlands for agriculture results in the decomposition of organic matter, leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, degraded peatlands are currently responsible for 2%-3% of global anthropogenic emissions. Preventing further degradation of peatlands and restoration (i.e. rewetting) are therefore important for climate change mitigation. In this study, we show that land-use change in three SSP scenarios with optimistic, recent trends, and pessimistic assumptions leads to peatland degradation between 2020 and 2100 ranging from −7 to +10 Mha (−23% to +32%), and a continuation or even an increase in annual GHG emissions (−0.1 to +0.4 GtCO2-eq yr−1). In default mitigation scenarios without a specific focus on peatlands, peatland degradation is reduced due to synergies with forest protection and afforestation policies. However, this still leaves large amounts of GHG emissions from degraded peatlands unabated, causing cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2100 in an SSP2-1.5 °C scenario of 73 GtCO2. In a mitigation scenario with dedicated peatland restoration policy, GHG emissions from degraded peatlands can be reduced to nearly zero without major effects on projected land-use dynamics. This underlines the opportunity of peatland protection and restoration for climate change mitigation and the need to synergistically combine different land-based mitigation measures. Peatland location and extent estimates vary widely in the literature; a sensitivity analysis implementing various spatial estimates shows that especially in tropical regions degraded peatland area and peatland emissions are highly uncertain. The required protection and mitigation efforts are geographically unequally distributed, with large concentrations of peatlands in Russia, Europe, North America and Indonesia (33% of emission reductions are located in Indonesia). This indicates an important role for only a few countries that have the opportunity to protect and restore peatlands with global benefits for climate change mitigation. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the initial growth, survival rate, and biomass content of Khaya senegalensis in a pure plantation system and under an agroforestry system (AFS) with banana and corn. The experiment was carried out in Northeast Brazil and measurements were made when trees were 30 months old. Spacing was 3 × 2 m and 3.5 × 3.5 m in pure plantation and in AFS, respectively. Banana and corn amounted to roughly 816 and 28.000 plants per ha for pure and AFS, respectively. The survival rate (99.7 × 96.1%) and wood density (595 × 551 kg dm−3) showed no difference between both systems. Individual growth was similar between both systems (0.0068 m3 tree−1). However, at the stand scale, yield was higher in pure plantation with a mean annual increase of 3.07 m3 ha−1 year−1, which means 129% higher than in AFS (1.34 m3 ha−1 year−1). Nevertheless, AFS added 20 and 8 t ha−1 of banana and green corn. Aboveground biomass accumulated at 30 months was 144% higher in the pure plantation (7.11 × 2.92 t ha−1), mainly leaf biomass, which was 228% higher in relation to AFS. In long rotation silvicultural systems like those used for African mahogany, only 100–400 trees per hectare will remain until the end of the rotation. As there was no difference in individual growth between the two systems, the AFS could be a very interesting alternative to mitigate establishment costs and optimizing land use with the production of agricultural crops specially to small farmers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The tropical Amazon has a unique biodiversity that has been affected by the development of pastures and economically important crops, such as soybeans. In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

AB  - Wildfire are increasingly frequent events on a planet undergoing climate change. With more favourable climate conditions for their occurrence, like prolonged periods of drought, the frequency and intensity of these catastrophes continue to increase. Protected areas are important territories for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity around the world and serve as a key management tool in national environmental policies. Many studies have been developed around the world to assess the conditions, frequency, and intensity of fires, and, on the other hand, protected areas are intensively studied to understand whether conservation actions are effective in keeping the ecosystem balanced. However, there are few studies that contemplate these two themes together. Consequently, this study offers a bibliometric analysis of the wildfires and its occurrence in protected areas, aiming to understand the spatial and temporal relation between them, characteristics of the research studies, and trending issues to be worked on. We used the Bibliometrix package in R language, which provides the option of different methods for analysing bibliometric data to understand the temporal evolution of the published documents about wildfires and protected areas. In total, 1116 publications were analysed, ranging from 1970 to 2022. The findings show that the terms “fires” (185 occurrences), “fire” (117), “wildfire” (101), and “forest fire” (92) are more frequently used and associated with studies on topics including biodiversity (304), conservation (221), environmental protection (188), deforestation (148), ecosystems (138), forestry (133), and climate change (126) as well as protected areas (399). The highest growth of research has been registered since 2002. The majority of the publications were published by authors from universities in the USA (77), South Africa (72), the United Kingdom (22), and Brazil (19). The USA leads all other countries with 7 of the top 10 international collaborations, followed by Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. However, only the United Kingdom continues to maintain an increased number of external (inter-country) collaborations, whereas the other nine continue to maintain an increased number of internal (intra-country). Considering the top 10 authors in terms of production, only 1 was active from 1999 to 2019, and the other 9 only have been active since 2009. The topics that stand out were subjected to a coupling analysis, which revealed that environmental protection is a motor theme, endangered species, Australia, and savannah are niche themes, and protected area, biodiversity, and fire management are basic themes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Land-use changes have contributed to an increased interest in understanding the drivers of forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes. This is particularly true for arid ecosystems, in which regeneration is relatively less known, but more sensitive to land-use intensification and climate change. This paper aims to identify the relative contribution of seed rain and soil seed banks for the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest in northeastern Brazil as well as their drivers. We monitored seed rain and soil seed bank of woody plant species during a 14-month period across 15 regenerating (4–70 yr old) and 5 old-growth forest stands. Stand age, precipitation, chronic anthropogenic disturbance, and forest aboveground biomass were our explanatory variables. A total of 5081 seeds from 61 species were recorded in the seed rain across all forest stands (1.81 intact seeds per m2 per month). Regenerating and old-growth stands did not differ relative to average seed rain scores, with the proportion of zoochoric seeds positively associated with forest biomass. In the seed bank, we recorded a total of 5660 seeds from 64 species (5.05 intact seeds per m2 per month), with no differences among stands, except for species richness; with mean seed size positively associated with stand age. Collectively, seed rain and seed bank captured only 40% of the woody regional flora, mostly dry-fruited species (70% of all species). Moreover, assemblages were dominated by a few hyper-abundant species. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest supports relatively low-density and impoverished seed rain and soil seed bank. Additionally, seed rain and soil seed bank do not exhibit directional changes through forest regeneration for most of the attributes, and deviate little from the scores of old-growth forest stands. Compared to resprouting, they may pose limited influence on woody plant recruitment and dry forest regeneration across human-modified landscapes. In this context, Caatinga restoration approaches based on natural seed rain and soil seed banks may be of limited effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Parkia platycephala Benth. is a native species with high nutritional and ecological potential that is used in forest recovery and restoration. However, studies on the diversity and population genetic structure of this species are limited. Therefore, 5036 nucleotide polymorphism loci (resulting from genotyping by sequencing) were used to investigate the diversity and population structure of P. platycephala in two localities of Northeast Brazil. One of the evaluated areas comprised the Conservation Unit, Sete Cidades National Park, the other location consisted of the trees located around the park. A high level of genetic diversity was found for both populations, with similar values of expected heterozygosity (HE = 0.29), showing the existence of a considerable level of genetic variation. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the diversity (99.06%) was distributed within populations. The results of the genetic structuring indicated little divergence between the plants, suggesting that the evaluated groups could be considered a single population. Few loci under selection (outliers) were identified; thus, no significant evidence of adaptive divergence was found. The results indicate that P. platycephala trees inside and outside the Conservation Unit maintain high genetic diversity, which has potential for use in breeding programs and for the production of seedlings for forest restoration. Furthermore, the importance of the Sete Cidades National Park for in situ conservation of this species is highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been widely investigated in Europe, Asia and North America regarding the occurrence and fate of antibiotic resistance (AR) elements, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens. However, monitoring data about AR elements in municipal WWTPs in Brazil are scarce. This study investigated the abundance of intI1, five ARGs (sul1, tetA, blaTEM, ermB and qnrB) and 16S rRNA in raw and treated wastewater of three WWTPs, using different sewage treatments named CAS (Conventional activated sludge), UASB/BTF (UASB followed by biological trickling filter) and MAS/UV (modified activated sludge with UV disinfection stage). Bacterial diversity and the presence of potentially pathogenic groups were also evaluated, and associations between genetic markers and the bacterial populations were presented. All WWTPs decreased the loads of genetic markers finally discharged to receiving water bodies and showed no evidence of being hotspots for antimicrobial resistance amplification in wastewater, since the abundances of intI1 and ARGs within the bacterial population were not increased in the treated effluents. UASB/BTF showed a similar performance to that of the CAS and MAS/UV, reinforcing the sanitary and environmental advantages of this biological treatment, widely applied for wastewater treatment in warm climate regions. Bacterial diversity and richness increased after treatments, and bacterial communities in wastewater samples differed due to catchment areas and treatment typologies. Potential pathogenic population underwent considerable decrease after the treatments; however, strong significant correlations with intI1 and ARGs revealed potential multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas, Arcobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Stenotrophomonas and Streptococcus) in the treated effluents, although in reduced relative abundances. These are contributive results for understanding the fate of ARGs, MGEs and potential pathogenic bacteria after wastewater treatments, which might support actions to mitigate their release into Brazilian aquatic environments in the near future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land fires lead to a deterioration of environmental quality and have perilous social and economic aspects. One method for mitigating this hazard is to determine the range of fire risk areas. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the current and potential future fire risk in the Ogan Komering Ilir, southern Sumatra region of Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and geospatial technology. In order to analyze fire risk areas, the Landsat 8 satellite image from 2021 (as a baseline period) was used. Variables like the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface temperature (LST) were extracted from the satellite image. Then, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was determined using rainfall data from meteorological stations. For future period prediction (periods 2021–2040 and 2041–2060), this study used future climate data from the CMIP6. By overlaying these variables, current and future fire risk zone maps were produced. The results obtained showed that in the current period, around 726.4 km2 (4.2%) of the area was at high fire risk, then 5,621.3 km2 (32.7%) and 10,835.3 km2 (63.1%) were at moderate and low fire risk zones, respectively. Furthermore, for the future period, this study estimated there was an increase in high fire risk areas of about 14% during 2021–2040 and 30% during 2041–2060. This was recorded in the southern and northern parts of the study area. Fire risk areas were strongly associated with NDMI, NDVI, and LST. The study's findings may be useful for land fire management in fire-prone areas. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors, and include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize and distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Seagrasses provide diverse ecosystem services that support communities, yet, they are among the most threatened marine habitats. Efforts to conserve and sustainably manage seagrasses are increasing, particularly amidst the era of climate change, in which they play a critical role. However, these activities often received less attention or were slow in gaining momentum partly due to a lack of societal recognition of seagrasses and their importance. Thus, in this study, we collected community perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services and threats from 391 respondents in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), a nationally declared protected area in Indonesia. We aim to provide insights on people's recognition of seagrasses from a local scale with strict protection measures. Overall, respondents showed varying perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, with provisioning services more highly perceived than regulating services. The perceived level of threats was inconclusive, though, reclamation along shorelines received higher rates (leaning toward most damaging) than other threats such as natural disasters and illegal fishing activities. Sociodemographic attributes of respondents were found to influence their perceptions, with occupation as the most pronounced driving factor. The variations observed in seagrass perceptions suggest that there is a need to strengthen and/or enhance seagrass awareness and education campaigns, which is in line with the increasing demand that public perceptions matter for the conservation and sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. We presented here the use and insights of community perceptions for seagrass blue carbon conservation in KNP, and consequently in Indonesia, where seagrass meadows are considered globally important carbon sinks. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Land use and climate change are expected to significantly alter hydrology and consequently electricity production in countries extremely dependent on their water resources, such as Brazil. Therefore, we used the large-scale hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which we integrated with climate change and land use scenarios for the Tocantins-Araguaia Watershed (TAW) with a focus on energy production at the Tucuruí Hydroelectric Plant (THP) in the southeastern Amazon. We used daily precipitation and temperature data from two General Circulation Models (GCM), HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 with moderate (+4.5 W/m2 in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels) and severe (+8.5 W/m2) radiative forcing from carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (Representative Concentration Pathways). For the land use and land cover change (LULCC) scenario, we replaced forest areas only with pasture, then with agriculture, then with reforestation vegetation, and finally with regenerated forest. Each LULCC period was coupled with the highest impact climate scenario found for TAW (MIROC5-RCP 8.5); thus, we investigated five scenarios and their impacts on hydropower production and revenue in THP. Our results highlight that the TAW will face a large water reduction by the end of the century, which in all scenarios will strongly impact the basin's energy production and hydro revenue. Reductions of up to 74% in annual flow and 63% in electricity generation are expected for the most pessimistic scenario (L8.5), triggering a 135% deficit per year in THP revenue. Although some land use change scenarios partially minimize the climate-driven flow decrease trend in the period of higher precipitation, there is still a dramatic reduction in flow during the dry season, thus exacerbating seasonal and inter-annual variability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) are a viable option for the mitigation of deforestation. Thus far AFS has been recognised and financed through the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) program; however, analysis of the potential carbon credit payment and productivity trade-off has rarely been conducted. This study aims to analyse the potential of cocoa-based AFS in terms of the trade-off of carbon accumulation and productivity in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The trade-off is shown through 20 years of financial analysis between the two schemes: AFS without the VCM scheme (agroforestry Business as Usual-aBAU); and AFS with the VCM scheme. A comparison is made between four types of cocoa plantations in West Sumatra: (i) Cocoa-Rubber (CR), (ii) Cocoa Multi-strata (CM), (iii) Cocoa-Coconut (CC), and (iv) Monoculture practice (M). The results showed that under the aBAU scheme, CC showed the highest Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of $6,647 USD and 5.8 respectively, while the lowest was CR, with an NPV and BCR of $2,423 USD and 2.73, respectively. Cocoa monoculture presented the group with the fastest payback period (PP) of two years. Utilising a VCM scheme under the Plan Vivo standard with Voluntary Emission Reduction (VER) as a selling unit, cocoa farmers stand to gain NPV by 15-25 % at VER prices of $8 USD Mg CO2e−1. It is thus concluded that cocoa-based AFS could be adopted under the VCM scheme with the dual purposes of enhancing carbon-storage through AFS and greater income for farmers. © Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The growth of the world population requires greater agricultural production, which consequently increases the demand for phosphorus-based (P-based) compounds and the generation of agro-industrial residues. Biochar is an effective alternative for the recovery and reuse of P-based species, as well to mitigate the generation of environmental liabilities and provide adequate disposal for agro-industrial residues. This study investigates the phosphate adsorption capacity of biochars produced with residues of açaí seeds (BA), Brazil nut shell (BN) and palm kernel cake (BK) and the relationship with their chemical constituents. Biochars were produced at 700 ºC to evaluate the physicochemical properties, elemental composition, contact time and influence of pH on phosphate adsorption. The solid/liquid contact time varied from 1 to 24 h and the adsorption of phosphorus species on biochar was strongly pH dependent (p < 0.05) between the biochars (BN > BA > BK). The Langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorption process (R2 ≥ 0.90) and showed high efficiency in phosphate removal in aqueous solution (BA: 92.34; BN: 123.55 and BK: 79.46 mg g–1). The heterogeneity of mineral constituents was emphasized by principal component analysis and indicated that phosphate adsorption on biochars is highly and directly associated with carbon (C) content, cation exchange capacity and pH and inversely related to nitrogen (N) content, yield, point of zero charge, (O + N)/C and ash content. Therefore, these biochars constitute promising materials for phosphate adsorption and present potential to be applied to soil as a source of P in the form of biofertilizer.

AB  - Drainage in tropical peatlands increases CO2 emissions, the rate of subsidence, and the risk of forest fires. To a certain extent, these effects can be mitigated by raising the water table depth (WTD) using canal or ditch blocks. The performance of canal blocks in raising WTD is, however, poorly understood because the WTD monitoring data are limited and spatially concentrated around canals and canal blocks. This raises the following question: how effective are canal blocks in raising the WTD over large areas? In this work, we composed a process-based hydrological model to assess the peatland restoration performance of 168 canal blocks in a 22000ha peatland area in Sumatra, Indonesia. We simulated daily WTD over 1 year using an existing canal block setup and compared it to the situation without blocks. The study was performed across two contrasting weather scenarios representing dry (1997) and wet (2013) years. Our simulations revealed that, while canal blocks had a net positive impact on WTD rise, they lowered WTD in some areas, and the extent of their effect over 1 year was limited to a distance of about 600m around the canals. We also show that canal blocks are most effective in peatlands with high hydraulic conductivity. Averaging over all modeled scenarios, blocks raised the annual mean WTD by only 1.5cm. This value was similar in the dry (1.44cm) and wet (1.57cm) years, and there was a 2.13 fold difference between the scenarios with large and small hydraulic conductivities (2.05cm versus 0.96cm). Using a linear relationship between WTD and CO2 emissions, we estimated that, averaging over peat hydraulic properties, canal blocks prevented the emission of 1.07Mgha-1 CO2 in the dry year and 1.17Mgha-1 CO2 in the wet year. We believe that the modeling tools developed in this work could be adopted by local stakeholders aiming at a more effective and evidence-based approach to canal-block-based peatland restoration.  © 2023 Iñaki Urzainki et al.

AB  - Among the invasive grasses harming natural ecosystems in Brazil, Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus) has received significant attention due to its high invasive potential and damage it causes to restoration sites. Here, we show the response of seedlings (10 cm to 1 m) and saplings (>1 m) one year after Guinea-grass removal in a 20-year-old restoration site in the Atlantic Forest. Thirty 10 × 20 m plots were installed and assigned into three treatments: control, mechanical removal using gas-trimmers, and mechanical removal followed by the application of Roundup Transorb R (glyphosate). Forest canopy and grass cover were also assessed. Guinea-grass was negatively correlated with woody species richness and abundance. Forest canopy cover was positively related to species richness and abundance, and negatively related to Guinea-grass. Treatments applied were successful in controlling the plant invader and did not cause any significant reduction in the total abundance or richness of saplings after one year. For seedlings, however, the abundance and richness of pioneer woody species increased over time with mechanical removal, while the abundance and richness of non-pioneer woody species decreased in plots treated with herbicide. We expect regeneration responses to continue to improve with time. Our results support the use of both herbicide and mechanical removal to reduce Guinea-grass in Atlantic Forest sites undergoing restoration, although the use of herbicide lowers native seedling richness in the short-term, while mechanical removal may be better for small sites, where it is more feasible and less demanding. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of extreme events due to climate change in the future will most likely increase, as suggested in the sixth IPCC assessment report. Climate change has been propounded as one of the prominent causes of the ocean’s extreme events, particularly those associated with atmosphere–sea interaction occurring in the tropical region of Indonesia. A typhoon is an extreme event that forms in the Western North Pacific Ocean and causes changes in oceanographic parameters in a region far from its origin point. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate how extreme events like Hagibis and Mitag typhoons affect the Significant Wave Height (SWH) in Jakarta Bay, particularly in the reclamation areas. SWH changes in Jakarta Bay due to the reclamation of Kita, Maju, and Bersama coastal areas have been simulated during both typhoons from 19th to 27th November 2007. The simulation was run from 1st October to 31st December 2007 using the Simulating WAve Nearshore (SWAN) model, and it was performed for two scenarios of pre-reclamation and post-reclamation. The analysis used a lagged correlation between wind speed magnitude in the study area within the South China Sea (SCS) and Indonesian Archipelago and SWH in Jakarta Bay from 19th November to 13th December 2007. It was found that the amplification of SWH changes in Jakarta Bay was associated with swell propagation from the SCS and Philippines, where Hagibis and Mitag typhoons were formed. The result exhibited that the most affected SWH due to the peak phase of Hagibis and Mitag typhoons (23rd November 2007) in Jakarta Bay was after an 11-day travel time, which was on 4th December 2007 compared to other dates. Hence, SWH during post-reclamation with regard to the three established reclamation areas (Kita, Maju, and Bersama coastal areas) responded to changes in SWH in Jakata Bay by up to 38.82% and down to 1.75% in Maju and Kita coastal areas, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Indonesian peatlands and their large carbon stores are under threat from recurrent large-scale fires driven by anthropogenic ecosystem degradation. Although the key drivers of peatland fires are known, a holistic methodology for assessing the potential of fire mitigation strategies is lacking. Here, we use machine learning (convolutional neural network) to develop a model capable of recreating historic fire observations based on pre-fire season parameters. Using this model, we test multiple land management and peatland restoration scenarios and quantify the associated potential for fire reduction. We estimate that converting heavily degraded swamp shrubland areas to swamp forest or plantations can reduce fires occurrence by approximately 40% or 55%, respectively. Blocking all but major canals to restore these degraded areas to swamp forest may reduce fire occurrence by 70%. Our findings suggest that effective land management strategies can influence fire regimes and substantially reduce carbon emissions associated with peatland fires, in addition to enabling sustainable management of these important ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location: Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results: Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions: Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Fire is a natural factor maintaining biodiversity and several ecological processes. The Brazilian Cerrado, considered the savanna with the highest biodiversity, is characterized by climatic seasonality, vegetation mosaics and topographic variations that together with fire determine its different plant physiognomies. The Chapada das Mesas National Park (CMNP), located in the south of the state of Maranhão (Brazil), has different savanna plant physiognomies with high ecological potential and archaeological and water wealth. The aim of the present study was to reconstruct the fire history over 28 years for the park and its surroundings (20 km buffer area), endeavouring to understand the impact of the creation of this National Park on its fire regime. Landsat satellite images were used from the TM, ETM + and OLI sensors to map the fire scars, which were identified and vectorized manually. The database created was used to analyze the total annual burned area, burned area percentage, density ignition, mean burn scar area and fire frequency during the mapped period. In total, 86 % of the CMNP was burn at least once between 1990 and 2017, while 72 % of the buffer area was burn. The creation of the park had significant effects on the density ignition when the periods before (1990–2005) and after (2006–2017) its creation were compared, and showed no significant effects on total annual area burned and average burn scar area. Despite the amount of burned area over time did not change significantly between the years before and after, the main change was observed in the fire seasonality after the creation of the park. In the park, 38 % of the area had a frequency of burn areas higher than ten times in the 28-year interval while 13 % of the buffer area was burn more than 10 times. In contrast, 23 % and 15 % had a fire frequency of 2 to 4 times on the buffer and the park respectively. Although the park was created to mitigate the human impacts of fire, the geographic isolation, the current occupation of the park by local populations and the pressure from agricultural expansion in the surroundings are influencing these conservation measures. Understanding the spatial–temporal distribution of fire in protected areas of the Cerrado contributes to improving management, preservation and conservation actions, so that in future studies other factors can be included to better understand the dynamic of fire occurrence in the region of the CMNP and in other protected areas of the Cerrado. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Conservation efforts in Indonesia in the last decade have been using many strategies to integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK). Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in Halmahera, Maluku, and the Urang Kanekes/Bedouin community in Lebak, West Java. Local ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory. © 2023 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical–chemical parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation). While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures. Our results on afforestation effects in subtropical grasslands are similar to those described for temperate zone, and may underpin the development of conservation strategies for land-use on subtropical grasslands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Whereas most contemporary frameworks evaluating land management aspects focus on institutional settings at a national level, the 8R framework of responsible land management aims at evaluating individual land management projects or interventions. This 8R framework is, however, still under development and needs testing, validation and further detailing, such that specific operational characteristics and internal and external effects can be included in the evaluation. This article addresses this need by demonstrating how the 8R framework could improve when knowing both the operational details and external effects of a land management intervention. By reviewing the documented implementation strategies and effects of eight different types of land reclamation cases in Indonesia, the article derives adaptations and extensions of the 8R framework assessment, such that the framework can better detect whether a specific project is sufficiently responsible in any of the 8R aspects. The induction shows that the number of types of systematic prompts needs to be extended and further detailed if it aims to capture and detect specific problems of structures, processes and impacts. Zooming in to documented reclamation projects in Indonesia shows that there are various types of such projects, which are oftentimes contested, yet each requires integrated land management and development strategies. Furthermore, they draw on dissimilar, mostly contextual, justifications and legal frameworks, which makes it difficult to compare the generic relevancy and sustainability of reclamation as a land management intervention tool. Nevertheless, testing the 8R framework for reclamation cases in Indonesia can improve its methodology and extent or specify the use of the systematic prompts designed to qualify and quantify the respective aspects. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainability is related to the exploitation of a resource without depleting it. To reduce environmental damage, sustainable forest management practices through low-impact exploration have been encouraged. However, studies that provide information for understanding the rainfall partitioning are incipient. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Sustainable Forest Management on rainfall partitioning and the maintenance of forest hydrology processes in the Jamari National Forest - southwest Brazilian Amazon. We examined the throughfall, stemflow, net precipitation and interception loss variability over 13 months in both an unlogged and logged (1625 and 1450 ind ha−1, respectively) Amazon Forest. Despite the higher tree density in the unlogged forest, the dendrometric attributes did not show significant differences between stands. Results indicate that throughfall exceeded rainfall on 54% and 42% of months in unlogged and logged forest, respectively. In the unlogged forest, net precipitation indicated that more water than that from rainfall reached the forest floor (105.6% = 102% throughfall + 3.6% stemflow). The logged forest showed a lower amount of rainfall, with 91.0% reaching the soil floor by net precipitation (89.8% throughfall + 1.7% stemflow). Especially in the dry season, net precipitation was 175% higher in unlogged forest. The amount of stemflow highlighted that the unlogged forest has more stemflow than the forest subjected to reduced-logging practices, i.e., the logged forest lost 4261 L m−2 BA−1 y−1 by stemflow, which is a reduction of 65%. For both stands, the total basal area-scale stemflow yield was higher on D <30 trees. The results reinforce that we need a better understanding of the impact of sustainable forest management on the ecohydrology processes in the Amazon Forest, as well as their implications for rainfall partitioning, especially in the context of climate changes at the local scale. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive research has been performed into the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) in preventing N losses; however, tropical agriculture has been underrepresented in recent meta-analyses. Here, we apply a meta-analytic approach using data from 50 articles to identify the impact of NIs (DMPP, DCD, and DCD + NBPT) on crop yield, N2O emissions, soil NH4+ and NO3− concentrations, and NH3 volatilization in subtropical and tropical regions of Brazil. In addition, the survey includes information about location; climate zone; cultivated crops; soil pH; soil organic carbon; soil texture; experimental method; soil management; irrigation; fertilizer source, rate, and type; and NI type and rate. Overall, the data set showed that NIs increased crop yield and soil NH4+ concentrations by 3 and 60%, respectively, whereas N2O emissions and soil NO3− concentrations were reduced by 62 and 31%, respectively. Ammonia volatilization was not changed by NI application. However, the combination of a NI with a urease inhibitor decreased such losses by 39%. The effectiveness of the NIs was highest in irrigated fields, fine-textured soils, and mineral N sources. Moreover, NI performance in Brazil was found to be similar in tropical and subtropical climates, and was also comparable to values previously reported in meta-analyses, including those conducted in temperate climates. Therefore, NI application is indicated to be an efficient strategy to delay nitrification and mitigate N2O emissions in tropical agroecosystems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: The Green Belt Biosphere Reserve, with 2.33 million hectares and its internal urban area with 220 thousand hectares, is configured as a water security territory and expresses a direct relationship between urban development and areas that ensure well-being and ecosystem services for 12% of Brazil's population. With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guarujá, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and São Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of São Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory. © 2023 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

AB  - One of the human activities that accelerates climate change is degradation and deforestation, which can lead to new land use in the form of palm oil plantations and agroforestry. Both of these land uses have the potential to store carbon, which can be optimized if the influencing factors are known. This study aims to estimate the potential for carbon storage in palm oil and agroforestry plantations in Gunung Mas, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and to analyze the effect of biophysical conditions such as topography, soil fertility, and stand density on the potential for carbon storage. The research was conducted in palm oil plantations (POP) and agroforestry areas categorized as agroforestry with forestry and palm oil plantation commodities (AG-SS), as well as agroforestry consisting of forestry, palm oil, and fruit crops (AG-SSB). Sample plots were determined through purposive sampling with 30 plots for each land use. The research results show significant differences in aboveground carbon (AGC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total carbon storage among the three land uses. The largest total AGC was in AG-SS (66.24 ton.ha-1), while the lowest AGC was observed in POP (48.15 ton.ha-1). The greatest SOC was recorded in AG-SSB (2163.21 ton. ha-1), followed by POP (1922.12 ton.ha-1) and AG-SS (1846.72 ton.ha-1). The highest total carbon storage was measured in AG-SSB (2223.36 ton.ha-1), followed by POP (1970.27 ton.ha-1), and the lowest in AG-SS (1912.96 ton.ha-1). Biophysical factors, including topography, soil fertility, and stand density, influenced carbon storage in each land use. Topography and stand density factors significantly influenced AGC, while soil fertility factors significantly affected SOC and total carbon storage in all three land uses. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Salt stress affects the production of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) seedlings. However, substrates with alternative materials in their composition can mitigate the harmful effects on the formation of watermelon seedlings. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the emergence and production of watermelon seedlings grown in different substrates under salt stress. The research was conducted in an agricultural greenhouse belonging to the Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira, Redenção, Ceará, Brazil. The experimental design used was completely randomized in a split-plot scheme. The plots were five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw: 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 dS m-1) and the subplots consisted of two formulations of substrates (SB1: sandy soil + sand + bovine manure; and SB2: sandy soil + sand + biochar; both in a 1:1:1 proportion on volume basis), with five repetitions of 25 seeds. The increase in the electrical conductivity of irrigation water from 1.5 dS m-1 reduces the percentage, speed index, and mean speed of emergence and increases the mean time of emergence of the watermelon crop. Substrate formulated with biochar reduces the time and increases the emergence indexes, besides enabling higher growth and biomass accumulation of watermelon seedlings. Salt stress reduces the growth, biomass, and quality of watermelon seedlings, but with less intensity with the addition of biochar. © 2023, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

AB  - Frosts affect coffee production in Brazil, with effects on commodity prices around the world. Agroforestry systems are strategies to reduce the effects of frost on coffee trees. To date, this study has evaluated the largest number of tree species in coffee tree AFSs in Brazil in the same experiment. The objective was to identify tree species that can protect coffee trees against frost damage in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted in Londrina, Paraná, Brazil. Each treatment consisted of coffee trees associated with one of the following tree species: Moringa oleifera, Croton floribundus, Trema micrantha, Gliricidia sepium, Senna macranthera, Heliocarpus popayanensis, and Mimosa scabrella, as well as a control of coffee trees in monoculture. The experimental area was affected by frost that damaged the coffee plants fifteen months after planting. Immediately thereafter, the dendrometric characteristics of the trees were evaluated. After 30 days, the defoliation and mortality of the trees were evaluated. The phytometric characteristics of the coffee trees were evaluated 12 months after the frosts. Six of the seven tree species were evaluated for the first time for their ability to protect coffee trees against frost. Even at an early stage of development, T. micrantha and H. popayanensis provided increased protection of coffee trees, reducing the defoliation and mortality of coffee trees. The main protective factor was the canopy area of these species, which provided a high rate of tree cover. The development of coffee trees after frosts was favoured by the shading of the species, with the exception of M. scabrella. The AFSs with T. micrantha and H. popayanensis constitute an alternative that allows the mitigation of frost damage to coffee plants in regions prone to this climatic stress, reducing defoliation and mortality. © 2023, Editora UFLA.

AB  - In 2012, the Native Vegetation Protection Law 12,651 decreased the extent of Areas of Permanent Preservation in Brazil. While previously the distance from water was measured during the rainy season, the new version only considered the extent of the regular watercourse. This change affects conservation and restoration sites, and restoration programs need to be modified based on the new legislation. For instance, more flood-tolerant species need to be planted, given the higher probability that restoration efforts will be lost during flooding. To identify species suitable for the restoration of such areas, we tested if plants that develop morphological structures to tolerate waterlogging stress are more resistant to hypoxia caused by flooding and can recover better afterwards. We experimentally evaluated survival and morphological or phenological strategies (root dry mass, height, basal diameter, adventitious roots, lenticels, and leaf renewal) of 13 tree species from the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes of Brazil. After 56 days of simulated inundation and 56 days of post-inundation recovery, we found that all study species were able to survive on waterlogged soil and to recover after the flood, and they can be used to restore periodically flooded riparian forests within the new legal zone. Our study is particularly relevant, as climate change is expected to increase flooding. As environmental laws change and new areas get restored including those in artificially flooded areas, such as on banks of hydroelectric dams, the experimental approach introduced in this study should be replicated with other species from various phytogeographic domains worldwide. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Tropical peatlands play a vital role in the global carbon cycle as large carbon reservoirs and substantial carbon sinks. Indonesia possesses the largest share (65 %) of tropical peat carbon, equal to 57.4 Gt C. Human perturbations such as extensive logging, deforestation and canalization exacerbate water losses, especially during dry seasons, when low precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates combine with the increased drainage to lower groundwater levels. Drying and increasing temperatures of the surface peat exacerbate ignition and wildfire risks within the peat soils. As such, it is critically important to know how groundwater levels in peatlands are changing over space and time. In this study, a multilinear regression model as well as two machine learning algorithms, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, were used to model groundwater level over the study period (2010−12) within a peat dome impacted by drainage canals and multiple wildfires in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Although all three models performed well, based on overall fit, spatial modeling of groundwater level results revealed that extreme gradient boosting (R2 = 0.998, RMSE = 0.048 m) outperformed random forest (R2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.054 m) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.970, RMSE = 0.221 m) near drainage canals, which are key fire ignition risk locations in the peatlands. Our study also shows that, on average, elevation and precipitation are the most important parameters influencing groundwater level spatiotemporally. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and function of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) are mediated both by disturbance type and intensity, and the environmental conditions, including climate. In a climate change scenario, the interaction between low water availability and chronic anthropogenic disturbances may potentially have drastic consequences on SDTF dynamics and the ecosystem services it provides. We hypothesized that in these naturally stressed systems, the effects of human disturbance are strongest in the most water-stressed sites, implying a worrisome synergism between harsh abiotic conditions (lower precipitation, higher temperature) and human effects, ultimately resulting in a less developed community structure and reduced diversity. By integrating information for the adult and regenerating vegetation strata in 21 sites distributed across climatic, plant cover and disturbance gradients in the Caatinga (seasonally dry tropical) forest of Brazil, we analyzed the individual and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbances, as measured through the Cattle Pressure Index and the Human Activity Index, along climate gradients, on community structure, diversity, and composition. As expected, the Cattle Pressure Index was negatively related to diameter at ground level, basal area, and diversity in the adult stratum, whereas for the regenerating stratum, litter stock had the strongest effect on vegetation structure. Climatic factors were poor predictors of the variation in the three true diversity measures (0D, 1D, and 2D) of the regenerating community. Our results revealed important cross-site differences in both vegetation strata over a small range of climatic variation. We conclude that the most stressful conditions associated with a very low precipitation regime enhance the effects on chronic disturbances, gradually driving SDTF communities into new alternative states and rendering these environments more prone to desertification. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indonesia is the world's largest palm oil producing country. The oil palm industry (plantation and milling) generates large amounts of solid waste in the form of empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS), mesocarp fiber (MF), oil palm fronds (OPF), and oil palm trunks (OPT). This leftover waste, collectively termed oil palm biomass (OPB), causes severe environmental pollution, thereby threatening the sustainability of the oil palm industry. Upgrading OPB by thermochemical processes (torrefaction and pyrolysis) has attracted significant interest as a means of recycling the residues and mitigating the environmental damage. This study reviews the previous research on the environment-friendly utilization of OPB in Indonesia. First, general information is presented on OPB in Indonesia (availability, properties, and governmental policy). Second, the torrefaction of OPB for the production of upgraded solid fuel is summarized. Third, the pyrolysis of OPB to produce biochar is reviewed for use as a soil amendment and in carbon storage. The market perspective and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the thermally treated OPB are discussed, targeting the generation of electricity (OPB torrefaction) and agricultural soil enhancement (OPB biochar). The recycling of OPB is expected to contribute to the sustainability and economic success of the oil palm industry and also the net-zero 2060 in Indonesia. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Primary forest conservation is essential for limiting climate change, for meeting conservation objectives, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Schemes that compensate communities for forgone extractive uses are important policy tools, but effective deployment demands an understanding of local deforestation drivers and host communities’ preferences. We use Q-methodology to reveal discourses present in three communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our results reveal three factors with a common emphasis on forest conservation and preferences for compensation in the form of social investments, rather than cash. The main contrasts were in attitudes towards farming. The first discourse, we call conservationist—open to ideas, displayed a commitment to learning better practices for community material benefit in service of forest conservation. The second discourse, which demonstrated greater confidence in their capacity to support livelihoods from farming, we call aspirational artisans. The third, which was acutely aware of the impact of their farming on forest conservation, we called passive, conflicted farmers. We also demonstrate an aspiration for the continued development of farming amongst participants, which although still correlated with preferences for forest conservation, may lead to compensation schemes inadvertently stirring future land use tensions if design does not reconcile agricultural development and conservation. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - According to data obtained from meteorological towers, Brazil has significantly increased temperature in the past 20 years, particularly in the North and Midwest regions. Vapor pressure deficit and evapotranspiration were also analyzed, showing an increase across the entire country, confirming that the air is becoming drier. This warming trend is part of the global climate change phenomenon caused by the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, fires, poor soil management practices, deforestation, and logging. The increase in temperature and dryness has profoundly impacted Brazil’s climate and ecosystems, leading to intensified extreme weather events and changes in the distribution of both animal and plant species. This study highlights the importance of utilizing meteorological tower data to monitor and understand the effects of climate change in Brazil. It emphasizes the need for immediate action to address its causes and mitigate its negative impacts. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas. © 2023, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Although healthy ecosystems are vital to sustaining human society, the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes have suffered from disorderly human development and the intense use of natural resources. Thus, cost-effective studies are needed to develop tools to assess environmental conservation and the integrity of water courses to inform decisions for ensuring their recovery where ecosystem maintenance is deficient. This study sought to develop a methodology in which the Watershed Habitat Evaluation and Biotic Integrity Protocol (WHEBIP) and Rapid Assessment Protocol for Habitat Diversity (RAP) could be used in an integrated, adaptive manner to evaluate the Water Ecosystem Integrity (WEI) in courses of rivers and streams in tropical regions of the Brazilian Cerrado–Atlantic Forest interface undergoing intense agricultural exploitation. Accordingly, a spatial assessment using geographic information systems was followed by a field visit to apply the methodology. A preliminary assessment of the soil conditions in the Lobo Reservoir Hydrographic Basin was conducted, identifying stretches of rivers and streams that were suitable for payment for environmental services and for recovery from the impact of anthropic activities. Such activities were present in 50.23% of the basin’s total area, and intensive degradation was found in stretches of the water courses, primarily where the head springs of the Itaqueri River and Lobo Stream, the principal tributaries of the Lobo Reservoir, lie. Native vegetation, Brazilian Cerrado, and reforestation occupy a total of 38.5% of the basin, comprising areas of intense conservation activity by the Brazilian government. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Ecological restoration mitigates the negative effects of fragmentation and habitat loss. This practice allows the conservation of key species, such as Ocotea porosa, a tree native to the Araucaria Forest and extremely endangered. A key point in restoration projects is the source of seeds, as well as guidelines for collection. When carried out under technical criteria, the collection allows the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptive potential in restoration plantations. Given the importance of seed source, genetic diversity, and adaptive potential, this study aimed to define areas and criteria for collecting seeds by characterizing the demography, genetics, and reproductive phenology of an O. porosa population. A plot of 16 hectares was installed in the municipality of Passos Maia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and a demographic survey of trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 15 cm was carried out. Indices of diversity and internal genetic structure (IGS) were estimated using allozyme markers. The reproductive phenology of 67 individuals was evaluated during 8 months. The studied population showed a high density of individuals (10.7 ind. ha-1) with normal diametric distribution. The phenological pattern of the species is regular, seasonal, and annual. The evaluated population showed high genetic diversity, high fixation index, and significant IGS up to 80 meters away. Based on these results, the evaluated fragment can be used as a seed collection area. It has high genetic diversity, density, and area size sufficient to contain several demes. In addition, it is highly recommended that the matrices be at least 80 meters apart to avoid the effects of significant IGS. © 2023, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, °C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, °C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 °C) and SST (5.2 °C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.

AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5–56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3–41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8–84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7–64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Agroforestry systems are critical for biodiversity conservation, land degradation mitigation, and climate change mitigation. This agroforestry approach reduces forest degradation, boosts food security, and gradually raises farmers' income. This study uses remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling tool s to analyze land potential and agroforestry status in Jatiyoso Sub-district, Karanganyar District, Central Java, Indonesia. The data used in the analysis support data for soil fertility index, rainfall, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite image data, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Modeling was done by integrating various thematic layers in the GIS domain. Weighting was also carried out i n the analysis of land suitability. The mapping results in Jatiyoso Sub-district, Karanganyar District, showed that 18.1% (13.49 km2) had high potential as agroforestry areas, 54.9% (40.95 km2) had medium potential, and 27% (20.18 km2) had low potential. As a result, using remote sensing and GIS to determine suitable land for agroforestry could significantly impact the community, particularly farmers, landowners, and foresters, in the decision-making process for developing agroforestry systems and practices and estimating important productivity indicators. The most promising and appropriate agroforestry plants developed in Jatiyoso Sub-district are medicinal plants, but agricultural commodities like cloves, bananas, and vegetables are also present. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Carbon offsets from voluntary avoided-deforestation projects are generated on the basis of performance in relation to ex ante deforestation baselines. We examined the effects of 26 such project sites in six countries on three continents using synthetic control methods for causal inference. We found that most projects have not significantly reduced deforestation. For projects that did, reductions were substantially lower than claimed. This reflects differences between the project ex ante baselines and ex post counterfactuals according to observed deforestation in control areas. Methodologies used to construct deforestation baselines for carbon offset interventions need urgent revisions to correctly attribute reduced deforestation to the projects, thus maintaining both incentives for forest conservation and the integrity of global carbon accounting. © 2023 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - Paddy rice production based on traditional soil management emits large amounts of methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study assessed the potential of no-tillage (NT) and winter cover crops (WCC) to mitigate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a subtropical paddy rice ecosystem. A long-term (20-yrs) experiment was evaluated regarding the effect of NT combined with winter fallow or three WCC (ryegrass, white oat, and birdsfoot trefoil) on seasonal CH4-C and nitrous oxide (N2O-N) emissions and on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to conventional tillage (CT) under winter fallow in a Gleysol of Southern Brazil. The changes in SOC were used as a proxy for annual net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges in the soil-atmosphere, taking the CT treatment as a reference. The GHG balance (summation of CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions multiplied by their global warming potential of 34, 298, and 1, respectively) and emissions intensity of GHG emissions were calculated. Across winter managements, NT decreased 25 % of GHG emissions in comparison to CT system. This effect was mainly related to the decrease of seasonal CH4-C emissions (31-113 kg ha-1) and by promoting SOC accumulation (0.45-0.65 Mg ha-1 yr-1) in comparison to CT system, since soil N2O-N emission was not affected by management practices. Increased soil CH4-C emissions offset the positive effect of WCC on SOC accumulation compared with winter fallow. Based on our findings, NT mitigates net GHG emissions in subtropical paddy rice ecosystems, but no additional effect is observed combining NT with WCC. © 2023, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - This article explored actor-networks and space–time production that affected the complexity of the social-ecological resilience of coastal communities through mangrove conservation efforts using a combination of the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Production of Space Theory perspectives. The case study area in Jenu coastal focused on Jenu Village because of the existence of Mangrove Center Tuban (MCT) conservation area. The study applied the regressive-progressive method qualitatively through descriptive, analytic-regressive, and historical-genetic stages. Data collected technique involved observation, semi-structured and in-depth interviews, and documentation, which were subsequently analyzed using Milles and Hubberman's interactive model analysis technique. Based on the analysis results, the adaptive cycle phases of social-ecological resilience of the community in the Jenu coastal area at a range of 1958–2020 began from the creative destruction phase and ended with the conservation phase (but none repeated phases had shown). Additionally, the phases were influenced by the agency of human actors (including the founder and managers of MCT, Jenu coastal communities, Tuban District government, etc.) and non-human actors (including coastal erosion, mangroves, trucukisasi system, sea fir, etc.). Those whole actors formed the network at each translation moment in determining the process of space transformation through space–time production, resulting in three different spatial production modes (exploitative, conservation, and economic). Theoretically, each phase of the adaptive cycle, actor-network translation moment, and spatial production mode could be interrelated as an interdisciplinary perspective to explore the process of social-ecological resilience of coastal communities when facing natural hazards. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Production systems that promote the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) must be implemented to maintain the sustainability of agriculture, livestock, and forestry. Since increases in MOS content contribute to improving the chemical, physical, and biological quality of the soil, as well as helping to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks after the implementation of agrosilvopastoral (ASP) systems in a Cerrado-Caatinga transition zone in Brazil. Native vegetation of Cerrado-Caatinga (NV), regenerating stratum of Cerrado-Caatinga (RS), two arrangements of ASP systems cultivating Cenchrus ciliaris L. intercropped with Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. × Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. hybrid (ASP1 and ASP2), and intercropped with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake × Eucalyptus grandis W. Mill ex Maiden hybrid (ASP3 and ASP4) were evaluated. Soil C and N stocks and the C content in the humic fractions of SOM were evaluated at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm soil depths. The introduction of ASP2, ASP3, and ASP4 systems in an area previously occupied by low productivity pasture increased and restored SOC stocks to levels found in NV, at a depth of 0–30 cm. N stocks were higher in ASP systems, regardless of the arrangement studied. As a result, the ASP systems provided accumulations that ranged from 1.0 to 4.31 Mg SOC ha−1 yr−1 and from 0.33 to 0.36 Mg N ha−1 yr−1. The carbon contents in humic fractions remained higher in NV. The hierarchical grouping and principal component analysis showed that the implementation of the ASP systems was efficient in increasing soil C and N stocks over time. In conclusion, the present study identified that integrated production systems can support land use intensification strategies based on sustainable and low-carbon agriculture in a transition area between the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Bio-sustainable aviation fuels (bio-SAFs) are an important pillar of the aviation sector decarbonisation strategy in the mid-term. Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of −286.8 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a “restoration hotspot.” We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990–2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed—climate change and functional traits—should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The long dry season during the El Niño event usually causes the groundwater level to drop significantly. As a result, soil CO2 emissions through peat decomposition are potentially increased compared to a normal year. Even so, studies on the effect of the El Niño years on peat decomposition are rare in tropical peatlands. The study objective was to compare soil CO2 emissions through peat decomposition during an El Niño and a normal year. A field study on soil CO2 emissions through peat decomposition measurement was undertaken in a smallholder rubber plantation on peat soil from July to October 2015, utilizing a trenching plot during the dry season. Also, as a comparison, soil CO2 emissions from peat decomposition were recorded during the same period in 2014. In 2015, a strong El Niño year, soil CO2 emissions from peat decomposition were significantly larger than in 2014, a normal year. Also, soil CO2 emissions through peat decomposition in 2015 showed a significant negative correlation with groundwater level. Our results showed that different climatic conditions affect the peat decomposition process on tropical peat soil. This result is expected to be used as important information regarding Indonesia’s peatland management in dealing with future climate change. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) was employed to develop a Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) and a quantitative model to investigate the changes in land use within the Brazilian Amazon. The process began by creating a theoretical NPF using a ‘systems thinking’ approach. Subsequently, a ‘system dynamic model’ was built based on an extensive review of the literature and on multiple quantitative datasets to simulate the impacts of the NPF, specifically focusing on the conversion of forests into open land for ranching and the implementation of soil management practices as a macro-level policy aimed at preserving soil quality and ranching yields. Various fallow scenarios were tested to simulate their effects on deforestation patterns. The results indicate that implementing fallow practices as a policy measure could reduce deforestation rates while simultaneously ensuring sustainable long-term agricultural productivity, thus diminishing the necessity to clear new forest land. Moreover, when combined with payments for avoided deforestation, such as REDD+ carbon offsets, the opportunity costs associated with ranching land can be utilized to compensate for the loss of gross income resulting from the policy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different model variables, revealing that lower cattle prices require resources for REDD+ payments, and vice-versa. The findings indicate that, at the macro level, payments between USD 2.5 and USD 5.0 per MgC ha−1 have the potential to compensate the foregone cattle production from not converting forest into ranching land. This study demonstrates that employing an IAM with a systems approach facilitates the participation of various stakeholders, including farmers and landowners, in policy discussions. It also enables the establishment of effective land use and management policies that mitigate deforestation and soil degradation, making it a robust initiative to address environmental, climate change, and economic sustainability issues. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere occurs as the result of various chemical, physical, and biological processes. The presence of CO2 around atmosphere greatly affects the agroforestry and agroindustry of coffee. This study aimed to describe the CO2 cycle in agroforestry and agroindustry of Gayo Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) and net CO2 ha-1 of coffee plantation. CO2 cycle was analyzed based on the movement of CO2 around the agroforestry and agroindustry of coffee. CO2 cycle model describes net CO2, CO2 emission, CO2 reduction, and CO2 sequestration. Net CO2 ha-1 of coffee plantation was 162.75 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, with CO2 emission was 203.84 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, CO2 reduction was 3.10 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, and CO2 sequestration was 363.49 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1. This research formulates the calculation of equivalent carbon emissions in the arabica coffee production system in the field and primary processing, using various methods (remote sensing analysis and calculation of direct and indirect equivalent carbon emissions). The CO2 cycle positively impacts the sustainability of agroforestry and agroindustry of Gayo Arabica coffee. © 2023 Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences. All rights reserved - Volume 16, Number 2.

AB  - Objective: Study carried out in the Padre Josimo Tavares settlement project, located in the Brazilian Amazon, to portray the social reality, productivity and agricultural spatial distribution, as well as its implications for the preservation of the Amazon biome. Theoretical framework: The developmental measures adopted in the Amazon region, which include the creation of numerous settlement projects, did not consider the need to conserve natural resources. Currently, it is necessary to boost agricultural productivity combined with strategies that contribute to plant recovery and curb deforestation. Method: Data were collected in the field, and also spatial data were obtained, which were synthesized and analyzed using spatial, statistical and multicriteria analysis to verify the distribution and environmental suitability of agricultural activities. Results and conclusion: The settlers grow various plant products and most of them produce species strongly adapted to the region, which offers a productive advantage. Beef cattle farming is widely practiced; however, it is widely identified as the main cause of deforestation in the Amazon biome. To overcome this environmental obstacle, the recommended and discussed approaches were the implementation of agroforestry systems and zero deforestation commitment policies. Research implications: Knowing the socioeconomic and environmental reality of settlement projects is essential to identify strategies that increase, in an integrated manner, social, economic and environmental sustainability. Originality/value: Use of unpublished data obtained through field collections of the RADIS-UFV Project, the result of a partnership between the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform and the Federal University of Viçosa. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Currently, more than five years after the Fundão dam failure in Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. is the main grass in pasturelands affected by the mining tailings. The aim of this study was to investigate the reason for this fact as well as to determine the ecophysiological effects of mining tailings on B. decumbens and to test whether mixing the tailings with unaffected local soil enhances the affected soil properties. For the experiment, two different soils were collected, one unaffected soil without mining tailings (Ref) and the mining tailings (Tec), and we also created a mixture with 50 % of each soil type (Ref/Tec). We cultivated B. decumbens in the three soil treatments in a greenhouse for 110 days and evaluated soil physical-chemical properties and plant ecophysiology. Our results show that the tailings (Tec) compromised the normal ecophysiological state of B. decumbens. The species survived these adverse conditions due to its great efficiency in acquiring some elements. The soil management tested by this work mitigated the stress caused by tailings and can represent an alternative for the environmental recovery of the affected soils. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The short paper addresses a multispecies systemic approach to uniting indigenous knowledge systems with earth jurisprudence and wild law using a systemic approach to storytelling and a range of mixed methods to develop rapport and relationships with participants who are members of an ongoing community of practice. The focus of this paper is on process and the space we have co-created through relationality. Our members pool diverse ways of knowing and being to focus on social, economic and environmental praxis to support multiple species. Ontologically and epistemologically we apply co-leaning to our praxis, and axiologically we assume that all transformative interventions should enhance fairness, transparency, and accountability as a basis for our case studies on risk reduction and the enhancement of wellbeing. The problem we are exploring in a forthcoming volume is whether pilot projects that put in place the principles of earth jurisprudence and organic farming (in partnership with members of PGS and the Wild Law institute) can make a difference to social and environmental justice. Our multidisciplinary and cross cultural team draws on indigenous knowledge systems as well as many other ways of learning and knowing through respectful dialogue to address our area of concern. Success is bench marked in terms of establishing a cooperative, the growing number of social enterprises striving to comply with organic farming principles, tree planting, seed collections for an organic seed bank and the perceived social, economic and environmental indicators of wellbeing. Our relational methodology applies participatory action research and storytelling to draw out themes which are mapped to assess progress towards re-generative living. Turning points for the better are indicated by a revised version of the UNSDG with a focus not on growth but on creating a cyclical economy that protects people and their shared multispecies habitat. To date our community of practice has managed to grow the number of participants and partners and our next goal is to set up two seed banks, one at the coast and one inland in South Africa in two case study areas in the Cape and Limpopo. This paper reflects on the process and methodology. The second companion paper details community case studies in South Africa on setting up a circular green economy. It is called: “A gender sensitive approach to uniting indigenous views on natural law with relational governance for protecting the commons”. It details responses to climate change aimed at mitigation and adaptation in both South Africa and Indonesia.

AB  - From distributed or semidistributed hydrological models, it is possible to identify where land use decisions can bring greater economic benefits in relation to water use. This study aimed to integrate simulations of a hydrological model varying the land use in four reforestation scenarios that influence the economic benefits of provision environmental services, including the user's alternatives as a key parameter and finally estimating the economic value of such benefits. The "avoided costs"method was used for economic valuation of flow regularization service and adequacy of water quality in the Piracicaba River basin, aiming to generate various economic instruments to support decision makers. The cost for water storage was estimated from the rising rain volume infiltrating the soil from the change in the dynamics of land use, whereas the cost of maintaining water quality was obtained from the variation between the effects of scenarios in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads. The valuation methodology allowed us to estimate the avoided costs, which will mainly contribute to application of economic instruments to manage water resources, directing land use decisions in hydrographic basins, guiding environmental impact assessment studies, and the definition of mitigation measures. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The Amazon biome is being pushed by unsustainable economic drivers towards an ecological tipping point where restoration to its previous state may no longer be possible. This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and has vast natural resources. In the maritime sector, efforts to realize the sustainability of natural resources in coastal ecosystems have focused on mangroves and seagrass meadows, also known as blue carbon ecosystems, that have an important role in regulating the Earth's climate. The need for ecosystem-based climate change mitigation combined with economic recovery and improved environment conditions has shifted the motivation and escalated mangrove restoration efforts in Indonesia. As the richest mangrove nation with the greatest mangrove carbon stocks in the world, recently Indonesia has taken significant steps in the land use sector to reduce emissions by acknowledging the ‘true’ value of mangrove carbon and setting priorities for mangrove conservation and restoration within Indonesia's climate actions. This paper reviews opportunities and challenges in mainstreaming mangrove blue carbon into policy in Indonesia. We evaluate the gaps in regulations and policies and propose pathways for the national blue carbon action. As mangroves are embedded in both forestry and marine sectors and the responsibilities for management lies within several government ministries, an integrated framework is suggested to support the national blue carbon strategy. The Indonesia Blue Carbon Strategy Framework (IBCSF) encompasses three main elements that should be considered in order to address challenges and seize opportunities in blue carbon: coordination, policy and funding. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The importance of forest restoration plantations to restore ecosystems and neutralize greenhouse gases is increasing, especially as a way to combat climate change. Research related to the growth of forest species and the influence of the environment should be considered to determine their potential in neutralizing carbon dioxide. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the growth in diameter at ground level and height of six forest species throughout the first year after planting according to meteorological variables. The experiment was conducted in the Carbon Zero Forest, part of the Open Space for Events on the main campus of the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV), Minas Gerais, Brazil. Planting of the 324 seedlings was conducted in December 2019, with 2.0 m x 2.0 m spacing, in a randomized block design. The meteorological characteristics for the year 2020 were obtained through the bulletins of the institution's own automatic station. The current increment in height and diameter was calculated for three-month intervals, per species. The data were subjected to Spearman's non-parametric correlation test. The significant correlations between increments in diameter at ground height and height with climatic variables were weak or moderate. In general, precipitation and maximum absolute temperature positively affected the current increment in height, while global radiation affected them negatively. Precipitation, average temperature and absolute minimum temperature negatively affected the current increment in diameter. The results obtained can help in the elaboration of strategies that promote the restoration of areas according to the adaptability of the species to adverse conditions, aside from potentiating the neutralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide. © 2023 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - Social Forestry (SF) in Indonesia has emerged as a keystone strategy for Sustainable Forest Management. By allocating 12.7 million ha of forest to be managed by local communities, the government has set in motion an ambitious plan for SF to reduce poverty, empower local people, and improve forest conditions. More recently, SF is framed for its opportunity to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study focused on examining the contribution of SF to the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goals in Yogyakarta and Lampung. By analyzing spatial data of SF areas and land cover changes using ArcView 10.8, the study assessed the carbon stock potential in SF areas. Carbon stock calculations were based on the 2022 National Forest Reference Level (FRL) for the periods before and after SF implementation. The finding of the study indicated that the carbon stock of SF areas in Yogyakarta and Lampung ranged from 9,214,381 to 9,923,420 ton CO2eq prior to SF, while the current carbon stock ranges from 8,703,489 to 9,393,706 ton CO2eq, representing a decrease (around 5.4%) rather than an increase. Overall, the changes in carbon stock were relatively small and localized, and the magnitude of the increase was insufficient to offset the overall decrease. To achieve the objectives of SF, such as meeting emission targets and achieving sustainable land use, it is crucial to carefully manage forest edges and fragmented forests, as they can contribute to carbon stock losses. Additionally, further studies and research are needed to improve the accuracy of carbon stock calculations, particularly for non-forest categories, which have higher uncertainty in the reference levels. © 2023 by Forest and Society.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is an important aspect of the sustainable management of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] in production systems. This work evaluated the effects of soil management systems (SMS) combined with liming performed in 1986 and in 2008 on soil physical properties and soybean yield. The study used data from the 2008/09 until the 2015/16 soybean crop seasons from a long-term experiment settled in 1986 in Passo Fundo, southern Brazil. A split-plot design was used with the SMS as the main plots arranged in randomized blocks, and the cropping systems as the sub-plots randomized within SMS. The experiment evaluated the effects of four annually performed SMS: no-tillage (NT) and reduced-tillage (RT) (i.e. two CA systems), disk ploughing + disk harrowing (DPD) and moldboard ploughing + disk harrowing (MPD) [i.e. two conventional tillage (CT) systems]. Soil bulk density (ρs) and total, micro and macro porosities (φtotal, φmicro and φmacro) were evaluated in 2008 and in 2016 in the 0‒2.5 cm (L0 − 2.5) and 10‒12.5 cm (L10 − 12.5) soil layers. After 22 years of the beginning of the experiment and compared with the undisturbed soil (from a native forest area near to the experiment), all SMS increased ρs by an average of 28% in the L0 − 2.5 and 25% in the L10 − 12.5, decreased φtotal by 13% (except for NT) in the L0 − 2.5 and 17% in the L10 − 12.5, and decreased φmacro by 36% in the L10 − 12.5; moreover the CT systems decreased φmicro by 8.7% and 8.1% in the L0 − 2.5 and L10 − 12.5, respectively. At the end of this 22-year period, in the L0 − 2.5, ρs increased by 6% from NT to RT, and by 11% from NT to CT systems; φtotal decreased by 4%, and φmicro increased by 9% from NT to the other SMS. From 2008 to 2016, liming combined with each SMS modified soil properties in distinct manners: the combination increased ρs by 6% in NT (L0 − 2.5) and 5% in MPD (L10 − 12.5), decreased φtotal by 4% in MPD (L10 − 12.5), increased φmicro in all SMS by an average of 6% (L10 − 12.5), and reduced φmacro by an average of 24% in CT systems (L10 − 12.5). Soybean yield was more variable as function of growing season (average from 1866 to 4449 kg ha− 1) as compared to SMS treatment [average from 3088 kg ha− 1 (DPD) to 3276 kg ha− 1 (NT)]. Considering a global analysis of the eight crop seasons, soybean yield in NT was on average 6% greater than that of DPD, but NT grain yield was similar to RT and MPD systems. No-tillage favored soybean yield in higher yielding environments, while DPD had the greatest soybean yield and adaptability in lower yielding environments. These findings suggest that the NT system outperformed the other SMS by providing greater or similar soybean yields and being the least harmful to soil physical quality as compared to the undisturbed soil. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village, West Brandan sub-district has been converted around 20 ha annually (1996–2016) into various non-forest land use. Rehabilitation can be a solution to restore the condition of the ecosystem so that it can resume its ecological and economic functions. This paper discusses the evaluation of mangrove rehabilitation carried out by planting 6000 propagules in December 2015 and 5000 seedlings in May 2016 with Rhizophora apiculata species in abandoned ponds. Monitoring was carried out every 6 months from 2016 to 2022. In the restored area, 11 true mangrove species and 3 associated mangrove species were found. The percentage of plants that survived after seven years was 69.42% for planting using propagules and 86.38% for planting with seedlings. The total biomass carbon stocks stored by 7-year-old plants using propagules was 51.18 Mg ha−1, while the carbon stored by planting using seedlings was 56.79 Mg ha−1. Soil carbon stocks at the planted site with propagules were 506.89 ± 250.74 MgC ha−1, and at the planted site with seedlings were 461.85 ± 102.23 MgC ha−1. The total ecosystem carbon stocks (including aboveground carbon) in the planted site using propagules were 558.07 MgC ha−1, while planting using seedlings were 518.64 MgC ha−1. The dataset and findings on the carbon storage evaluation of mangrove rehabilitation will be useful for blue carbon research community and policymakers in the context of the climate change mitigation strategy for Indonesia. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Studies in the long-term recruitment and mortality of mangrove seedlings can help to understand mangrove demography and its relationship with climatic variables, environmental restoration and advances in the ecology of this ecosystem. A seven-year population dynamics study of seedling recruitment and mortality in cohorts of Rhizophora mangle L. was carried out to identify expansion processes and patterns of survival in the understory of mangrove forests on the Atlantic coast of Brazil. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between recruitment and mortality R. mangle seedlings at the population level, salinity, and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature and humidity). On an annual scale, seedling recruitment was positively correlated with mean temperature. Seedling density was negatively correlated with the number of recruits and positively with the number of deaths. The number of recruits was associated with dead seedlings, temperature and precipitation considering a population scale, without grouping the data. The seedling density in the stands increased with the number of dead seedlings. Our findings described the relationship between climate variability (durability and magnitude of the dry/rainy season) and the long-term population dynamics of R. mangle seedlings in a poorly studied region and from what moment, on a monthly and annual time scale, did this relationship become significant and changes occur. The findings of this study provide information on the population dynamics of the species that will help in understanding mangrove demography. These results have important implications for projections about the recruitment and survival of the species thinking about to long-term climate change that will modify current weather patterns and mangrove conservation efforts. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Black soils store a high amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) and play a crucial role in climate change, food security, and land degradation neutrality. However, data and information regarding black soils in tropical regions, including Indonesia, are limited. This study aimed to characterize and identify the utilization of black soils in Indonesia based on legacy soil survey data. We collated 142 soil pedon samples of Mollisols from articles, technical reports, and existing datasets. The site information (site position, elevation, land use type, parent material) and selected physicochemical properties were stored in a spreadsheet, from which exploratory data analysis was conducted. The result showed that the median SOC content was 1.53%, ranging from 0.6 to 8.2 %; cation exchange capacity was 30 cmol kg-1, ranging from 9 to 95 cmol kg-1; base saturation was 87%, ranging from 11 to 100 %; and bulk density was 1.21 g cm-3, ranging from 1.13 to 1.36 g cm-3. Other soil characteristics (particle size distribution, exchangeable bases, pH, pore, and water retention) varied with horizon type and land use/land cover. The black soils have been used for paddy fields, dryland farming, and gardens with low management intensity. Main cultivated crops include rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), cassava (Manihot esculenta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and cocoa (Theobroma cocoa). Threats to black soil functions include soil erosion, carbon loss, and nutrient imbalance. Soil and water conservation measures, integrated soil nutrient management, and agroforestry are among the best land management practices for black soils. © 2023 SAINS TANAH – Journal of Soil Science and Agroclimatology.

AB  - Batu City in East Java has a thriving tourist area, which is not exempt from disaster susceptibility and economic vulnerability. These weaknesses have led to the strengthening of the disaster resilience system becoming a priority in terms of the Batu government’s disaster risk reduction. The main objective of this study is to improve disaster risk management through the reinforcement of the disaster risk reduction instrument, which can improve the alertness and the mitigation capability of DRR. This research analyzed the susceptibility levels of five disasters—flood, landslide, drought, land fire, and COVID-19—using a quantitative method with panel data and a survey questionnaire. The influence variable was disaster susceptibility, which quantified economic vulnerability through ArcGIS and ILWIS analysis to generate the disaster susceptibility rate. Economic vulnerability was analyzed using static panel data in STATA/R, which generated the economic vulnerability index. The results of this research indicate that there are five villages in the high level of vulnerability category, three villages in the moderate level of vulnerability category, and another sixteen villages/urban villages in the low level of vulnerability category. Furthermore, static panel analysis found that local economic vulnerability in Batu is significantly influenced by three of the five disasters discussed in this research. © 2022 by the authors.

Estimating carbon storage using remote sensing in the Selo Resort forest area of Mount Merbabu National Park, Central Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 24: 6264-6270. This study is of paramount importance for long-term climate change mitigation efforts, as it aims to estimate carbon storage and assess land cover density in Selo Resort forest area of Mount Merbabu National Park (MMbNP), Central Java, Indonesia, utilizing remote sensing techniques. Sentinel 2A satellite imagery, acquired on May 28, 2023, serves as the foundational dataset for this research. Employing ArcGIS 10.5, the satellite imagery was processed to derive the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a critical parameter in this analysis. The NDVI values were subsequently employed to categorize land cover density, leading to the classification of land into five distinct classes: non-vegetation, shrubs, low density, medium density, and high density. This classification process enabled the determination of land cover density. The calculated values for each density class, namely low, medium, and high-density land cover, revealed substantial carbon storage potentials: 12,357.99 tons C, 92,871.04 tons C, and 73,542.06 tons C, respectively. Moreover, the computed areas for low, medium, and high-density cover were 202.59 ha, 364.93 ha, and 348.26 ha, respectively. This study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring to detect changes in land cover and to implement afforestation initiatives in areas with low-density vegetation. Such efforts are crucial for the preservation of land cover and the associated carbon storage benefits, thereby contributing to broader climate change mitigation strategies. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Water scarcity is a problem of global relevance that is affecting more and more people in the world. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have around 35% of the world’s renewable water resources. However, the management of water resources and inequality in access to water has made water scarcity a problem of growing interest in the region. The reuse of water could be an efficient measure to reduce the demand for water resources in the area. In particular, the reuse of greywater is a simple and decentralized method of water reuse, which would mitigate the impact of the lack of water in isolated or difficult-to-access areas. Using the Aquastat database, water consumption in the world and water availability in LAC were studied. In addition, the regulatory framework for water in LAC countries was studied, with an emphasis on water reuse and greywater legislation. Agriculture is one of the most demanding of water in the world, particularly, in LAC, which demands around 70% of renewable water resources. Furthermore, in LAC, the availability of drinking water in rural areas is lacking, with seven countries having less than 80% access to healthy drinking water. The water regulation in LAC is quite heterogeneous. The most general regulation around water is found in the political constitutions of each country. Some constitutions explicitly indicate access to water as a human right, while other constitutions do not include information in this regard. Although some countries have specific regulations on the reuse of wastewater, there is a general lack of regulations related to the reuse of greywater. In most cases, the term “greywater” is not even defined in the general water and wastewater laws. As of the date of this article, only Chile, Peru, and Brazil have bills to regulate the reuse of greywater, of which only the Chilean is approved. The reuse of greywater could help reduce water demand for non-drinking uses. However, the implementation of greywater treatment systems represents a cost that is difficult to cover, especially in the poorest countries of the region. Countries must improve their public policies to improve the management, use and reuse of water to mitigate water scarcity that severely affects human consumption in the region. The relevance of this study lies in providing a general framework of the water situation in LAC for studies and public policies focused on promoting water reuse as a measure to mitigate water scarcity. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Alternate wetting-drying (AWD) is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields. The research aimed at comparing AWD on contrast soil textures. Field experiments were conducted at two sites representing coarse-texture soil (silt loam) and finer-texture soil (silty clay) to study the efficiency of AWD on water use, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), and GHG intensity (GHGI). The experiments were conducted during the 2020 dry season in Central Java province, Indonesia, evaluating continuous flooding (CF) and AWD as the main plot, and biochar-compost (BC) mixture at a rate of 0, 5, and 10 t ha−1as the sub-plot. The results unveiled that AWD on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12% and 18%, respectively. The implementation of AWD on silt loam soil significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total GWP by 39.6% without yield loss and GHGI by 38.4% compared to CF. Conversely, on silty clay soil, the GWP and GHGI reduction was marginal (only about 4%). Biochar-compost addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures. We found that the implementation of AWD on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and GWP. Expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of GHG mitigation action and saving irrigation water. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rewetting peatland is an ongoing effort in Indonesia to restore the hydrological cycle and carbon balance of the ecosystem. However, quantifying the impact of rewetting on mitigating fire remains a challenge. Here, we assess the impact of large-scale rewetting on fire risks and occurrences (duration, coverage area, and the number of events) in 2015–2021. The weather research and forecasting (WRF) model was integrated with a drought–fire model to spatially quantify fire hazards in Riau, Sumatra. The results show that rewetting has resulted in decreasing the frequency of extreme events in the study area (pre- and post-rewetting, respectively, were seven and four events). Although the area influenced by extreme events reduced following rewetting by 5%, the mean duration of extreme events increased. Our findings reveal that widespread prolonged extreme fire hazards only occurred during drying El Niño events in 2015 and 2019. The findings obtained in this case study provide quantitative evidence of the reduced fire hazard resulting from peat restoration in Indonesia. Further, the findings assist in assessing the success of peatland restoration programs and improve our knowledge of the ability to monitor and forecast fire risks in tropical peatlands. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The main challenges facing the Eucalyptus plantation industry are employing sustainable projects in suitable areas, and using safer forestry strategies, given climate variability and climate change. Brazil is the world's largest Eucalyptus producer, and more areas have been allocated for Eucalyptus plantations, even in areas that are considered persistent climate change hotspots. Researchers can combine adequate agroclimatic zoning methods with Earth System Model (ESMs) outputs to analyze changes to climate variables, to map suitable areas, and to outline adaptive measures for Eucalyptus plantations. Despite these facts, studies on the Eucalyptus species are still scarce. This study analyzed the impacts of climate change to suitable areas for planting Eucalyptus in Brazil, using proper Agroclimatic Zoning (AZ) method, and outlining effective adaptive measures for sustainable Eucalyptus cultivation under future climate scenarios. Daily precipitation, air temperature (mean and maximum), and global solar radiation data were used from a set of simulations and projections of nine ESMs, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), in two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The AZ method was simulated for the current climate (1980–2005), and projected for the near (2021–2050), and far future (2071–2100) climates, in two RCPs. Given intense and persistent changes to precipitation, air temperature, evapotranspiration, and water deficits, i.e., prolonged and continued changes to climate variables resulting from climate change, Eucalyptus plantations will be restricted and economically unfeasible for industrial purposes for about 15 % (RCP 4.5), to 47 % (RCP 8.5), of Brazil in the far future, covering a large part of the North, the north of the Center-West, and the northwestern part of the Northeast, including the new Brazilian agroforestry frontier (MATOPIBA). Only ∼12 % of Brazil, encompassing small areas of the South, the South-Southeast, and a small portion in the Northwest region of the North, will be suitable for Eucalyptus plantations, since these regions are less vulnerable to climate change. As for the rest of Brazil (between ∼42 % and ∼80 %), regular suitability is projected, and the future of Eucalyptus plantations in these places will depend on adopting ‘effective adaptive measures’ and making ‘safe silvicultural decisions’ in order to deal with projected temperature increases and water deficits, including genotypes selection, improvements in hybridization techniques or breeding programs, planting in wider spacings (or lower stockings), and thinning and pruning at shorter intervals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services, safeguarding coastal communities and economies. However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing exposure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would increase to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current distribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low- and middle-income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The indiscriminate use of fertilizers and chemical pesticides can lead to boron contamination of the soil. Decontamination in general is expensive and results in other impacts. Phytoremediation is a sustainable alternative for soil restoration. Astronium fraxinifolium Schott (Anacardiaceae) is a tree species native to the Cerrado that is considered to be a pioneer species and a selective xerophyte, and it has been widely used in the reforestation and restoration of degraded areas. This study set out to characterize the physiology and anatomy of A. fraxinifolium under different boron concentrations and to assess the tolerance and phytoremediation potential of the species. An experiment with a completely randomized design was conducted in a greenhouse. The carbon allocation and chlorophyll content of leaves of A. fraxinifolium were determined. Boron concentration and the species’ tolerance index were calculated from root and shoot samples. Levels of amino acids, proteins, total carbohydrates, starch, phenolic compounds, and anatomical analysis were also measured. A. fraxinifolium showed tolerance to boron concentrations in the substrate and accumulated a greater amount of the element in the aerial part, showing its phytoextraction ability. No significant differences were found in the physiology of A. fraxinifolium; however, some anatomical changes were observed. In the leaves, there were changes in the thickness of the abaxial surface of the epidermis and palisade and spongy parenchyma, and total leaf thickness, and in the roots, there were changes in the thickness of the phloem, diameter of vessel elements, and number of vessel elements per square millimeter. However, boron did not interfere in the development and survival of A. fraxinifolium, which points to the possibility that the species has phytoremediation potential. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Comparison between the ability of carbon storage for various types of land use, both inside and outside forest areas, needs to be done in order to predict its ability to deal with climate change mitigation and adaptation programs in Indonesia. Local baseline data need to be known because each vegetation growth is strongly influenced by local environmental conditions. This study was conducted to compare the ability of carbon storage in pine plantations and agroforestry patterns at high altitudes. The research method was carried out purposively by determining sample plots that were considered representative of the type of land use. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the ability to store aboveground carbon between pine plantations of 86.80 tons/ha and agroforestry patterns of 56.14 tons/ha. Similarly, the comparison of the aboveground and underground carbon storage capacity, there was a significant difference, namely for pine stands 78.99% to 21.01%, while agroforestry pattern was 53.58% to 46.42%. Overall, both types of land use can be relied on to address climate change mitigation programs in Indonesia.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The agroforestry system has been widely presented as a model for land management to restore ecosystem function and, at the same time, increase people's income. The land cultivation system by combining forestry plants with agricultural crops is expected to attract people's interest to adopt and carry out planting on a wider scale. This paper aims to examine the development of agroforestry products in supporting peatland restoration and food security, as a lesson learned from South Sumatra. Field observation and stakeholder interviews were conducted to collect data to be analyzed descriptively. The result revealed that a relatively adaptive forestry plant that was developed on peatlands could produce timber and non-timber forest products. The community developed agroforestry system as their source on income and at the same tima can support peatland restoration. Unfortunately, the market of a certain product is currently unavailable. In addition, for other types of crops, the price will drop during the harvest season, making them less profitable. Therefore, diversification of products is needed as a solution for the community. In the future, the types of plants that are developed on peatlands must have prospective market access to benefit the community and improve the welfare of the people. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Current knowledge on the Cuvette Centrale peatland complex and future research directions The Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex in the world, covering approximately 145,000 km2 across the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It stores ca. 30.6 Pg C, the equivalent of three years of global carbon dioxide emissions and is now the first trans-national Ramsar site. Despite its size and importance as a global carbon store, relatively little is known about key aspects of its ecology and history, including its formation, the scale of greenhouse gas flows, its biodiversity and its history of human activity. Here, we synthesise available knowledge on the Cuvette Centrale, identifying key areas for further research. Finally, we review the potential of mathematical models to assess future trajectories for the peatlands in terms of the potential impacts of resource extraction or climate change. © 2021, Bois et Forêts des Tropiques.

AB  - Low impact development (LID) practices contribute to the reduction of flooding and improvement of water quality. Water crises may be a result of water scarcity and flooding due to climatic changes and the increase of impervious areas, and thus, stormwater harvesting becomes a sustainable alternative solution for relative water problems. The performance of a bioretention system with the submerged zone (SZ) and unsaturated zone (USZ) was evaluated as an alternative for stormwater harvesting. The study was carried out on a laboratory scale, using a bioretention box to simulate the processes that occur in a real system and in the field. The system was efficient in removing TP (68.5% and 76.5%), COD (71.6% and 56.9%), and NO2 (28% and 16.6%) in USZ and SZ events, respectively. NH3 removal (31%) occurred only at SZ events. NO3 was exported at all events tested but at values below the Brazilian CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 on the quality of water bodies for supply. The bioretention effluent showed relatively high values of turbidity; however, the pH parameter presented good values in all experiments (>6.5 and <7.5), and E. coli only in some cases presented satisfactory values to meet the Brazilian Standard for Rainwater Usage for nonpotable purposes (<200 MPN/100 mL). In general, both configurations provide different improvements for stormwater to support sustainable water resources management. This study presents a comparison between bioretention systems with and without SZ as an initial proposal for the improvement in bioretention systems in Brazil; however, more experiments must be monitored, and new improvements should be tested for reaching restrictive water reuse purposes. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to look into the diversity of species and carbon storage in agroforestry systems in the Forest for Special Purpose at Aek Nauli, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. A total of 60 subplots, 1.0x1.0m were used to represent different undergrowth species in the agroforestry system. By identifying constituent species in the agroforestry system, the diversity of undergrowth species was studied, and the potential for biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter was measured and analyzed. Undergrowth species in agroforestry Toona sureni and Coffee Arabica are significantly richer in plant species (27 species vs. 14 in agroforestry P. Merkusii and C. Arabica). The results showed that the diversity undergrowth was categorized as moderate, and the evenness indices were low, ranging from 0.33 to 44. In the agroforestry system, the mean biomass of undergrowth was 1.65 tons ha-1, and the carbon storage of undergrowth was 0.43 tons ha-1. Meanwhile, litter biomass was 5.18 tons ha-1 on average, with 2.5 tons ha-1 of litter carbon storage. Both biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter in agroforestry T. Sureni, and C. Arabiba vs. P. Merkusii and C. Arabica are significantly different. By applying sustainable agroforestry management in forests for special purposes, this study helps with future climate change adaptation and mitigation. © 2022 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - The objective of this study was to double production by True Shallot Seed (TSS) in sandy land agro-ecosystems, widely adapted especially in temperate climate regions. Even though vegetative planting has been carried out using tubers in rice fields and dry land in Indonesia, not much has been done on sandy land. Another research gap also presents from the considerably low actual productivity (10-15 t ha-1) that still can be doubled (>20 - 30 t ha-1) in sandy land. The study used three varieties (Lokananta, Bima, and Trisula) and carried out in three stages: characterization and identification of soil biophysical properties, an in-site study of the seed nursery system of TSS, and an assessment of cultivation development based on plant populations increasing production. This study resulted in TSS productivity 30.66-236.00% higher than average national productivity for all three varieties; this is a novel finding. TSS productivity on sandy land ranging from 14.831 to 28.178 t ha-1 was above the national average production at 10.48 t ha-1 of bulb-seed originated shallots. Thus, this result indicates that TSS seed planting system is more profitable, particularly for shallot seed producers (traders and farmers), aside from saving transportation costs. Another benefit is supporting planning and agronomy development, especially the progress of planting shallot from seeds in Indonesia. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.

AB  - High-quality, suitably adapted tree seed at volume is a key component for the implementation and long-term success of forest landscape restoration (FLR). We analysed the tree seed systems in four Asian countries—the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and India—which have committed to restore in total over 47.5 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030. We assessed the national seed systems using an established indicator framework, literature review and expert surveys and interviews. Additionally, we surveyed 61 FLR practitioners about their challenges in acquiring seed to understand how the strengths and weaknesses identified at the national level were reflected in FLR projects on the ground. Identified key constraints common to the studied countries are (i) a mismatch between the growing demand for priority native species and the limited seed supply in terms of quantity and quality, (ii) lack of effective quality control for seed of native species and (iii) lack of information about the effects of climate change on native species to guide species selection and seed sourcing and to improve the resilience of restored ecosystems. We discuss options to strengthen seed systems for native tree species both in terms of quality and volume to enable them to effectively respond to the national FLR commitments and make recommendations on promising technical solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Peatlands have enormous potential to produce food sources for supporting population growth. Farmers generally prefer plants that can adapt to changing conditions. However, challenges remain, such as limited knowledge of local community about peatlands' function and management. Local community practices endogenous knowledge to manage peatlands, but it is rarely documented as best practice for peatlands management in Indonesia. This study aims to understand endogenous management implemented by local community for sustainable peat cultivation. The management is currently considered as the best solution to solve problems related to peatlands management. The study was carried out in Tumbang Nusa Village, Pulang Pisau Regency, Central Kalimantan Province, using a semi-participatory approach with a stratified purposive sampling for selecting participants of in-depth interviews and field observations. An investigation of endogenous management related to biophysical aspects that determines sustainability was done by identifying main characteristics of peatlands in the dry season. The data were analyzed qualitatively by using Use Value. The results show that the community applied agroforestry systems interspersed with introduced plants. There were seven patterns implemented by the community, including pineapple-forest crops-seasonal fruit-food based, rubber-forest crops-seasonal fruit/food-based, a combination of forest plants, a combination of forest plants-annual introduced plants, a combination of forest plants-annual/food crops, and a combination of annual crops. The seven patterns based on the local wisdom are suitable for peatlands. It is in accordance with modern peat management which considered as the form of a pure Paludiculture and an intensive semi Paludiculture.  © 2022 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Tropical peatlands store vast volumes of carbon belowground. Human land uses have led to their degradation, reducing their carbon storage services. Clearing and drainage make peatlands susceptible to surface and belowground fires. Satellites do not readily detect smouldering peat fires, which release globally significant quantities of aerosols and climate-influencing gases. Despite national and international desire to improve management of these fires, few published results exist for in situ tropical peat fire behaviour and associated carbon emissions. We present new field methodology for calculating rates of fire spread within degraded peat (average spread rates, vertical 0.8 cm hr−1, horizontal 2.7 cm hr−1) and associated peat volume losses (102 m3 ha−1 in August, 754 m3 ha−1 in September) measured at six peat fire sites in Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 2015. Utilizing locally col-lected bulk density and emission factors, total August and September gas emissions of 27.2 t ha−1 (8.1 tC ha−1) and 200.7 t ha−1 (60.2 tC ha−1) were estimated. We provide much needed, but currently lacking, IPCC Tier 3-level data to improve GHG estimates from tropical peat fires. We demonstrate how calculations of total emission estimates can vary greatly in magnitude (+798% to −26%) de-pending on environmental conditions, season, peat burn depth methodology, bulk density and emission factors data sources, and assumed versus observed combustion factors. This illustrates the importance of in situ measurements and the need for more refined methods to improve accuracies of GHG estimates from tropical peat fires. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Among mine wastes, tailings are known to have the largest environmental impact, as they have high concentrations of trace elements and are susceptible to wind dispersal and water erosion. A tree plantation trial was installed at Kipushi tailing (DR Congo) in order to mitigate the contaminant dispersal in the surrounding areas. Fifteen years later, the present study was conducted for the purpose of investigating the macronutrient and metal content in amended holes and assessing the performance of tree species through root behavior in the tailings dams. Results show elevated available P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration in the surface and amended layers, which is higher than the unpolluted soil of the miombo woodland. Trace metals were manifold higher compared to the pedo-geochemical background of the region, with Cu and Co concentration tending to increase in the organic matter-rich layers, while Zn, Cd, Pb, and As remained higher in tailings. Compared to the tailing layer, roots grew well in the amended layers, but few roots ranging from very fine to big from all the surviving species were able to grow beyond the amended layers, indicating the possibility of tree survival on the tailings dams over many years. Acacia polyacantha and Psidium guajava are species that showed a higher quantity of roots in the unamended tailing layers. Leaves should be avoided for human or animal consumption, but as the concentration of Cu, Zn, and Co in guava was lower, there is no indication of hazards in case of their consumption. Therefore, the use of well-adapted tree species on the mix-up of the organic amendments with the uncontaminated topsoil seemed to be a good technique for the reclamation of larger polluted areas.

AB  - The utilization of natural resources in recent decades is not accompanied by proper and effective management. This has a major impact on environmental degradation in watershed scale and climate change. The study aimed to evaluate changes in soil characteristics at various ages of sand mining and the cost of reclamation of environmental degradation due to sand mining activities. The study was conducted in Sumberbulu Micro Watershed, which is located in Wajak Sub-District, Malang Regency. Soil sampling was collected from un-mined, 2 to 6 years old sand mining and post-mining lands. Natural resource equivalency analysis (REA) was applied for environmental damage assessment and reclamation cost calculation required to restore natural resource services to their original condition. The findings show that sand mining activities significantly decreased soil organic C in 0-40 cm soil depth, resulting in increased soil bulk density and decreased soil porosity at 20-40 cm depth of soil. Sand mining activities by using truck traffic carrying mining products, soil erosion, and the removal of topsoil during mining activities determined changes in soil properties. REA shows that the total area of land that must be reclaimed is 21,487 ha. The land will be reclaimed by revegetation (with maize) to restore the lost function of environmental services and income of local farmers, assuming a reclamation cost of 36,767,500 IDR/ha. Therefore, post-mining land reclamation should be encouraged by the government for mining business actors in Indonesia so that the land can be reused as before. © 2022 Brawijaya University.

AB  - Deforested, drained, and converted tropical peat forest is common in Southeast Asia, and these areas have become a major source of carbon (C) emissions. In this study, measurements of peat properties, i.e., peat thickness, organic matter (OM), bulk density (BD), total organic C (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were taken four years apart (2012–2016) at 24 sites in a previously deforested and drained tropical peat in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We calculated that the average peat subsides at a rate of 3.8 ± 1.2 cm yr−1. The estimated net change in C stock ranged from −8 to −41 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, with an average of −31 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. C loss varied by peat depth and land use. C loss was four times faster on shallow peat (50–100 cm) than deep (>300 cm) peat sites. Fallow sites (bush fern and secondary forest) subsided and lost C faster than oil palm plantations, likely due to land-clearing fires. Percent C and C/N ratio declined significantly in the upper 150 cm of peat, especially in the fallow sites, indicating oxidation within the peat profile. No change occurred in bulk density, showing little effect of compaction, though the density profile migrated downward with subsidence. The current peat topography, modeled from satellite LiDAR data, reflects past peat-loss patterns and confirms the coring results. C loss in this region continues at a high rate since its original deforestation in the early 1970s. This study concludes that C loss due to anthropogenic disturbances on tropical peat is larger than the 2013 Tier 1-IPCC CO2 emission factor for Acacia and oil palms on drained tropical peats, which are 20 and 11 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper develops the transboundary concept of market-based commons to explore how partial and incomplete privatisation measures are contributing to the creation, operation, and maintenance of common property in agrarian societies embedded in global economies. Focusing on Indonesia’s Riau province, I show how transboundary publics and geographically dispersed users of peatland resources collectively engage in environmental stewardship around sustainable forms of peatland development and activities aimed at mitigating the socio-ecological costs of growth. The paper explores three types of peatland commons centred on social agroforestry using paludiculture (wet cultivation) techniques, fire mitigation strategies, and green supply chains around sustainable peatland products. I argue that while these market-based commons are still in their infancy, they inscribe a specific set of transboundary governance relationships that seek to reform rather than resist capitalism by promoting both the protective and productive functions of carbon-rich peatlands as profitable environmental goods of public value.

AB  - Dual functional innovative approaches were developed to tackle the algal scum problem in water by utilizing the algal (Spirogyra sp.) biomass waste for organic dye-laden industrial wastewater treatment, a global problem, and challenge. Therefore, an algal biochar-based nanocomposite (nAgBC) was synthesized and employed as a low-cost adsorbent for Congo red (CR) removal. Surface morphology, physicochemical characteristics, elemental composition, phase, and stability of the nanocomposite was analyzed using BET, FESEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, XPS, and TGA. The nanocomposite was found to be thermostable, mesoporous with large and heterogeneous surface area, containing nAg as doped material, where –OH, NH, C[dbnd]O, C[dbnd]C, SO, and CH are the surface binding active functional groups. Maximum adsorption efficiency of 95.92% (18 mg L−1 CR) was achieved (qe = 34.53 mg g−1) with 0.5 g L−1 of nanocomposite after 60 min, at room temperature (300 K) at pH 6. Isotherm and kinetic model suggested multilayer chemisorption, where adsorption thermodynamics indicated spontaneous reaction. Fluorescens spectral analysis of CR confirmed the formation of CR supramolecule, supporting enhanced adsorption. Furthermore, the result suggested a 5th cycle reusability and considerable efficacy towards real textile industrial effluents. Synergistic effects of the active surface functional groups of the biochar and nAg, along with the overall surface charge of the composite lead to chemisorption, electrostatic attraction, H-bonding, and surface complexation with CR molecules. Thus, synthesized nAgBC can be applicable to mitigate the wastewater for cleaner production and environment. © 2021

AB  - As is well known, tropical peatlands are deposits of terrestrial organic carbon of global importance. It is estimated that around 15% of carbon is stored in peatlands worldwide. Indonesia contains approximately 50% of the world’s tropical peatlands with frequently cited estimates of about 21 Mha. Pelalawan district area (Riau Province) is dominated by peat soils. The land in Pelalawan is mainly covered by industrial plantations of acacia forests and oil palms. The area is very susceptible to the loss of carbon stocks in peat soils due to the opening of drainage channels. This study aims to calculate the carbon stocks of subsurface peatlands in Pelalawan, especially in the research location. The method used is a grid survey, the distance between the particular points is 500 m, which covers the total area of the research site, i.e. 2,500 ha. The number of observation points is 121, which includes measuring the thickness of the peat layer, calculating bulk density, and C organic content. The paper analysed the distribution of carbon stocks in the peat bottom based on the thickness class. The results showed that carbon stocks in the peat bottom in Pela-lawan were 218,753.95 tons/ha consisting of 143,138.40 tons/ha in the peat thickness of >300 cm (very deep peatland), 44,999.10 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 200–300 cm (deep peatland), 21,577.67 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 100–200 cm (medium peatland), 4,780.78 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 50–100 (shallow peatland), and 4,258 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 0–50 (very shallow peatland).

AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Planting native species of economic interest is attractive to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation because of their potential to generate income, products and services, combining socioeconomic and environmental demands. Direct seeding is a low-cost restoration technique compared to nursery-raised seedling planting, but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in Brazil. We tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the Brazilian Cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. We monitored germination, survival, growth and establishment for three years. Of the 9000 seeds planted, 18.7% germinated, 29.8% survived and 8.9% were established three years after sowing. Eugenia dysenterica (Mart.) DC. and Dypterix alata Vogel had higher germination, survival and establishment rates and are, thus, the most appropriate species. E. dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed Cerrado and D. alata in agroforestry system, hillside fields and lower field. The species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility. However, phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth. Our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the Cerrado is promising to some species, and to others, the sowing should be done with more seeds, or using nursery-raised seedling. The planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) represent a broad spectrum of outcomes and governance systems. Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs’ effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs’ effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Petén (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs’ temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Petén (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre’s Community Managed PAs’ have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

AB  - The adoption of conservationist systems can improve the protection of soil organic matter (SOM) and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, we aimed to quantify the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, C content in the SOM fractions and microbial C (Cmic) in the topsoil of an Acrisol under traditional and agrisilvicultural systems in the Southeast of Brazil. The evaluated treatments were native vegetation of Cerrado (NV), pasture of Urochloa brizantha (PAST), monoculture of pigeon pea (MCP), and agrisilvicultural system (Eucalyptus + pigeon pea; AGS). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm to determine the soil C and N contents and stocks, C associated with granulometric and humic fractions of SOM, and soil Cmic. The C contents in AGS and MCP systems were similar to NV at 5-10 and 10-20 cm, and soil C stocks in AGS were similar to NV and higher than in PAST system at 0-20 cm. We found a higher percentage of protected C in the silt + clay fraction, and the AGS system contributed to an increase in this organomineral fraction at 10-20 cm soil depth. The C contents in the free light fraction (0-5 cm) and humin (5-10 and 10-20 cm) were also similar between AGS and NV, giving greater protection of SOM in both systems. For Cmic and microbial quotient values we found no differences among the evaluated systems. The results indicated that after conversion of NV to different land uses, the AGS system more effectively increased the C stocks in the topsoil and protected the SOM. © 2021 2021TheAuthor(s)(ortheiremployer(s)).PublishedbyCSIROPublishing.

AB  - Mangrove restoration projects are now widely established, aiming to regain the carbon benefit of the mangrove ecosystem that is essential for climate change mitigation. This study aimed to investigate mangrove litter as the source of carbon in restored mangrove forests in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, which previously experienced substantial mangrove loss due to shrimp aquaculture development. We assessed the production and decomposition of mangrove litter and associated macrozoobenthic biodiversity in restored forests with plantation age ≥14 years and intact mangrove forests as the reference. The monthly production of three groups of mangrove litter (leaf, reproductive, and wood) was assessed over 12 months. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was performed to inspect the interspecific and disturbance history variation in organic matter formation among four major mangrove species: Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina, and Sonneratia alba. Our results showed that annual litterfall production from restored and intact mangroves in Perancak Estuary were 13.96 and 10.18 Mg ha−1 year−1, which is equivalent to approximately 6282 and 4581 kg C ha−1 year−1 of annual litterfall carbon sink, respectively. Although restored mangroves had significantly higher plant litterfall production than intact mangroves, no significant difference was detected in leaf litter decomposition and macrozoobenthic biodiversity between these forest types. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Deforestation and the disorderly exploitation of natural resources for agricultural expansion occurred at an accelerated pace in the Brejo microregion of the state of Paraíba, Brazil, which resulted in abandonment and erosion of the soil in a large part of the region. In view of this scenario, the present study was undertaken to investigate the soil respiration in systems involving different forms of land use and cover in caatinga enclaves moist forests (Brejo de Altitude areas). The study was conducted in four land use and cover systems, namely, pasture, mandala agriculture, agroforestry system, and forest. Microbial activity was estimated by quantifying the carbon dioxide (CO2) released in the soil respiration process, from the soil surface, and captured by KOH solution. Soil temperature (°C) and water content (%) were monitored simultaneously with the analysis of soil respiration. The forms of land use and cover have a direct effect on the metabolic activity of soil organisms, and climatic factors such as soil temperature and moisture influence the dynamics of organic matter decomposition and, consequently, the release of CO2. The production of CO2 is higher at night than during the day, regardless of the analyzed systems. Among the evaluated areas, the forest showed the lowest CO2 emissions, so it was considered a CO2 receptor in contrast to the pasture area, which functioned as a CO2 emitter. Management techniques that reduce surface temperature and increase organic matter should be prioritized to promote soil biota. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water–carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003–2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth’s climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapó territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Studies around the world show an increase in global average temperatures, with a consequent increase in extreme events and changes in the distribution of precipitation, causing a decrease in agricultural production and changes in planting areas. This study analyzed the exposure to climate risk that the coffee crop in the region of Alta Mogiana/SP, Brazil has been presenting in the past thirty years (1991-2021). Time series of daily data of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were used. By the statistical tests we observed a trend of increase in maximum temperatures daily of approximately 1.4°C and minimum daily of 0.8°C in the municipalities of the region and a trend towards a decrease in precipitation of 0.9 mm daily, indicating greater exposure of the coffee crop in the region to climate risk and increased vulnerability for the coffee producer. In view of these analyses, a literature review was carried out, suggesting agroforestry systems and mechanical irrigation as the most promising strategies to manage climate risk in coffee plantations. In addition, drought-resistant cultivars, training courses for farmers, increased rural insurance, and nutritional control of the plants can also be considered efficient options for climate exposure in coffee plantations from Alta Mogiana. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Recurrent extreme landscape fire episodes associated with drought events in Indonesia pose severe environmental, societal and economic threats. The ability to predict severe fire episodes months in advance would enable relevant agencies and communities to more effectively initiate fire-preventative measures and mitigate fire impacts. While dynamic seasonal climate predictions are increasingly skilful at predicting fire-favourable conditions months in advance in Indonesia, there is little evidence that such information is widely used yet by decision makers. In this study, we move beyond forecasting fire risk based on drought predictions at seasonal timescales and (i) develop a probabilistic early fire warning system for Indonesia (ProbFire) based on a multilayer perceptron model using ECMWF SEAS5 (fifth-generation seasonal forecasting system) dynamic climate forecasts together with forest cover, peatland extent and active-fire datasets that can be operated on a standard computer; (ii) benchmark the performance of this new system for the 2002-2019 period; and (iii) evaluate the potential economic benefit of such integrated forecasts for Indonesia. ProbFire's event probability predictions outperformed climatology-only based fire predictions at 2- to 4-month lead times in south Kalimantan, south Sumatra and south Papua. In central Sumatra, an improvement was observed only at a 0-month lead time, while in west Kalimantan seasonal predictions did not offer any additional benefit over climatology-only-based predictions. We (i) find that seasonal climate forecasts coupled with the fire probability prediction model confer substantial benefits to a wide range of stakeholders involved in fire management in Indonesia and (ii) provide a blueprint for future operational fire warning systems that integrate climate predictions with non-climate features.

AB  - The genus Croton is the second largest genus of Euphorbiaceae family, comprising more than 1300 registered species. The species Croton grewioides is endemic in the northeast of Brazil and distributed mainly throughout the caatinga biome presenting, in its essential oils, various compounds with biological activities such as pupicidal, larvicidal, insecticidal, and bactericidal. The secondary metabolites commonly found in their extracts include diterpenes, phenols, steroids, and aglycone and glycoside flavonoids derivatives, which can undergo variations based on climatic changes that modify processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration and nutrient cycle. To understand the effects of seasonal variability and extraction method on the biological activities of polar extracts from C. grewioides, fingerprint chromatograms were analyzed aided by chemometric analysis. In vitro assays of cytotoxicity against HL-60 and HepG2 cancer cells and anti-acetylcholinesterase activity were performed. Seasonal effects could only be observed in the chemical profiles of the methanolic and ethanolic extracts from accessions 113 and 126, respectively. Considering the extraction method, the chromatograms of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of all the accessions were similar, but differed from those for the corresponding methanolic and ethanolic extracts. Five hexane partitions were active against HL-60 cell line, displaying inhibition values between 81 and 93%. Only the ethanolic extract of accession 101 (winter), the methanolic partition from the methanolic extract, and the decoction of accession 113 (winter) presented high inhibition values against the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. This study enabled elucidation of the effects of seasonality and extraction method on the biological activities presented by the C. grewioides extracts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of São Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, São Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in São Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of São Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several “savanna-dwelling” species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Brocket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirão Preto and Jundiaí. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present insights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win–win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth, and their water storage dynamics strongly control these carbon stocks. The hydrological functioning of tropical peatlands differs from that of northern peatlands, which has not yet been accounted for in global land surface models (LSMs). Here, we integrated tropical peat-specific hydrology modules into a global LSM for the first time, by utilizing the peatland-specific model structure adaptation (PEATCLSM) of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM). We developed literature-based parameter sets for natural (PEATCLSMTrop,Nat) and drained (PEATCLSMTrop,Drain) tropical peatlands. Simulations with PEATCLSMTrop,Nat were compared against those with the default CLSM version and the northern version of PEATCLSM (PEATCLSMNorth,Nat) with tropical vegetation input. All simulations were forced with global meteorological reanalysis input data for the major tropical peatland regions in Central and South America, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. The evaluation against a unique and extensive data set of in situ water level and eddy covariance-derived evapotranspiration showed an overall improvement in bias and correlation compared to the default CLSM version. Over Southeast Asia, an additional simulation with PEATCLSMTrop,Drain was run to address the large fraction of drained tropical peatlands in this region. PEATCLSMTrop,Drain outperformed CLSM, PEATCLSMNorth,Nat, and PEATCLSMTrop,Nat over drained sites. Despite the overall improvements of PEATCLSMTrop,Nat over CLSM, there are strong differences in performance between the three study regions. We attribute these performance differences to regional differences in accuracy of meteorological forcing data, and differences in peatland hydrologic response that are not yet captured by our model. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding past forest dynamics and human influence is essential for future forest management and ecosystem conservation. This study aims to provide insights into the forest dynamics and agroforestry history in the highlands of Sumatra for the last 1800 years. We carried out palaeoecological multi-proxy analyses of pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, macro-charcoal, and X-ray fluorescence on a limnic sediment core taken from Danau Kecil in the submontane area of Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results provide an 1800-year record of forest dynamics under climate change and human influence including the transition from forest opening to shifting cultivation and eventually permanent agroforestry. Indicators for forest openings and secondary forest formation have been present since the beginning of records (AD 200). This is followed by the possible initiation of sugar palm (Arenga) cultivation (AD 400). Since AD 500, potential agroforestry and forest gardening practices have promoted major timber trees such as Lithocarpus/Castanopsis, Bischofia, and Dipterocarpaceae combined with sugar palm (Arenga). Permanent agroforestry systems were possibly established since AD 1760, evinced by an increase in commodity trees such as Dipterocarpaceae for resin production. With the Dutch invasion ca. AD 1900, agroforestry intensified and expanded to the Kerinci Valley. This was followed by land use intensification and potential rice cultivation around Danau Kecil since the 1940s. This study provides the first details on past forest dynamics around Danau Kecil since AD 200, showing among others how appropriate forest management and a closed canopy could reduce fire vulnerability in submontane rainforest. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Mangroves are uniquely important ecosystems, for preserving biodiversity, sustaining livelihoods, and mitigating against climate change. However, they are degraded globally and are therefore a priority for ecosystem restoration. To date, the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor, and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area. Thus, more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed. Ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both. Here, we assessed the utility of using species-interaction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time. We compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated “monoculture reforestation,” “mixed species regeneration” and “reference forest” plots in two study areas in Sulawesi, Indonesia, an estuarine, and a coastal fringe mangrove system. We also combined and evaluated sampling methods, utilizing traditional plant–animal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way. We found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots, with contrasting effects between the two sites. Our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects, which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics, such as species richness, were used alone, with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning. We also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing species-interaction networks, overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The Pantanal is the largest seasonal wetland in the world with a landscape that consists of a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats, and floodable and non-floodable savannas, pastures and forests. Drought events are expected to occur more frequently in the Pantanal biome under future climate conditions, but the effects of land management and hydrological extremes on pastures have been poorly studied at spatial scales relevant to local livestock. In this study, we measured CO2[sbnd]C fluxes using eddy covariance over a hydrological year on pastures within a cattle farm in the Brazilian Pantanal that experienced seasonal flooding. Our measurements show that seasonally flooded pastures were large emitters of CO2[sbnd]C, contributing 337 g CO2[sbnd]C m−2 year−1 to the atmosphere. During flooding, when the soils were anaerobic, and soil O2 was close to zero, the flooded pasture was a net sink of -18 g CO2[sbnd]C m−2, while during the aerobic phase (soil O2 > 15%) the pasture was a significant CO2 source to the atmosphere (301 g CO2[sbnd]C m−2). Transitions to and from anaerobic conditions corresponded to 54 g CO2[sbnd]C m−2. Our results indicate that the seasonally flooded cattle pastures in the Brazilian Pantanal may be an important regional source of CO2[sbnd]C for the atmosphere. Better management, and use of drought resistant grasses, may be a way to improve soil C stocks and limit emissions, especially as global climate change is anticipated to increase heating and drying for the Pantanal biome. © 2022

AB  - Mangroves have long been known as the important ecosystem for being home to aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, as well as fisheries resources. It is also considered an efficient carbon pool in tropical regions such as Indonesia. However, recent developments in the coastal areas of Bengkulu City in Indonesia could potentially alter and erode mangrove functions, in particular, mangroves as a carbon sink. Previous studies on the role of mangrove forests concerning global warming in the area have not illustrated the distribution of biomass and carbon and its uncertainties. Hence, this study aimed to assess mangrove richness, biomass and carbon content to provide the current state and distribution and its role in climate change mitigation. Six sampling locations were determined reflecting area distribution and its status (conservation and non-conservation). A total of 60 nested quadrat plots were employed for the trees and saplings category. Above-and below-ground biomass was estimated by using the allometric model. The findings showed that a total of nine species were observed. The average biomass and carbon stocks were 302.27 t ha-1 and 135.02 t C ha-1, respectively, over seven-fold higher than the previous studies. Pantai Panjang station was the highest storing carbon at 235.95 t C ha-1, while the lowest was in Teluk Sepang (74.61 t C ha-1 ). These findings also suggest that non-protected mangrove forests also played a key role, similar to the conservation mangrove forests, regarding the climate change mitigation. It is, therefore, urgently required to enhance the strategy and program in order to maintain the current mangrove ecosystems within and beyond the conservation areas. © 2022, BIOFLUX SRL.

AB  - In decades, Brazilian cities have undergone profound changes, accentuated after implementing public policies such as Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) and Minha Casa Minha Vida (PMCMV). This article assessed the urban expansion in the Benedito Bentes (BB) district, Maceió, Brazil, during 1987-2017. The objectives of this investigation were: i) to assess the environmental degradation from the urban advance and the land use/cover (LULC) via orbital sensors products (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, Land Surface Temperature - LST and CO2 Flux) for the following years (09/03/1987, 09/07/2003, 10/21/2012 e 12/14/2017); and ii) propose a landscape intervention based on native urban afforestation. The NDVI appointed a drastic reduction of vegetation between 1987 and 2003, from 23.3 km2 to 4.8 km2. On the other hand, LST values showed a significant increase between 1987 and 2017, from 22.1 ± 0.6 °C to 26.9 ± 2.1 °C, in some BB areas, these values were higher than 30 °C. Regarding the estimate of CO2Flux, in average terms, in 1987 were absorbed 3.5 μmol.m−2s−1, and in 2017 started emitting 0.4 μmol.m−2s−1. These Brazilian government programs minimized the housing deficit from a socio-economic perspective. However, this rapid urbanization without sustainable planning contributed to increased LST, changed the local LULC and microclimate. The solution to this problem can be the mitigation via urban reforestation from plantings of native trees (Bauhinia forficata, Bauhinia variegata, Caesalpinia leiostachya, and Cassia spectabilis) in an area of higher population circulation to reduce the urban heat island effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatlands store around one-sixth of the global peatland carbon pool (105 gigatonnes), equivalent to 30% of the carbon held in rainforest vegetation. Deforestation, drainage, fire and conversion to agricultural land threaten these ecosystems and their role in carbon sequestration. In this Review, we discuss the biogeochemistry of tropical peatlands and the impacts of ongoing anthropogenic modifications. Extensive peatlands are found in Southeast Asia, the Congo Basin and Amazonia, but their total global area remains unknown owing to inadequate data. Anthropogenic transformations result in high carbon loss and reduced carbon storage, increased greenhouse gas emissions, loss of hydrological integrity and peat subsidence accompanied by an enhanced risk of flooding. Moreover, the resulting nutrient storage and cycling changes necessitate fertilizer inputs to sustain crop production, further disturbing the ecosystem and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under a warming climate, these impacts are likely to intensify, with both disturbed and intact peat swamps at risk of losing 20% of current carbon stocks by 2100. Improved measurement and observation of carbon pools and fluxes, along with process-based biogeochemical knowledge, is needed to support management strategies, protect tropical peatland carbon stocks and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The Cerrado region has adapted to fires because of its climate and vegetation conditions, but with increasing frequency, regional fires will begin to degrade the biome. Therefore, research is necessary to determine whether the occurrence of fires is beneficial or degrading to the environment, and if the fire origin is natural or anthropic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the vulnerability of vegetation to different scenarios of future climate change. The study area was the Ecological Station of Uruçuí-Una, located in the south of Piaui. The methodology consisted in identifying burnt areas in terms of their recurrence; evaluating the correlation between burnt areas and precipitation and temperature; analyzing burnt areas and the Mann Kendall trend for vegetation for the period 2001 to 2018. Based on the current vegetation conditions, the vegetation and land use were estimated for the year 2100 through the Markov chain and the vulnerable areas were estimated observing different scenarios of climate change of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Fase 6 (CMIP6). The results indicated that fires with frequencies above 5 in the interval of 18 years have a negative Pearson correlation and the Mann-Kendall analysis, which implies a state of vegetation degradation. Regarding the future climate scenarios, savanna sites with temperatures above 38 °C, a vegetation index below 0.4, and monthly precipitation less than 90 mm were those with the highest level of vulnerability. Vulnerability mapping can help to improve public policies for fire management for the sustainable development of this region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural ecosystems are under severe threat worldwide and environmental policies are essential to minimize present and future impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change. The New Forest Act in Brazil is the main policy to protect native vegetation in private lands, which comprise 54% of the remaining Brazilian native vegetation. However, conflicts between environmental and agricultural concerns in its implementation demand for balanced solutions based on scientific evidence. To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the São Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in São Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State’s implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process. Most of the scientific information and advice, even after discussion and common understanding among a diverse stakeholder group, were ignored or over-ruled in the final decision-making phases. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. © 2021 British Ecological Society

AB  - Peatlands are shaped by slow litter decomposition, but threshold decomposition rates that allow peat formation remain unclear. Can agroforestry in the tropics be compatible with paludiculture that allows peat formation? We explored the determinants of litter decomposition in wet agro-forests adjacent to tropical peatlands in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) by litterbag studies (up to 16 weeks) with standing litter sources to estimate rate constants, characterize litter quality (especially lignin (L), polyphenolics (Pp) and nitrogen (N)), and monitor temperature and groundwater levels. In litter transfer experiments we tested for home-field advantage (HFA) effects between land cover types. Mean residence times around 85 weeks at 27 °C were associated with a high (L + Pp)/N ratio. However, in the crossover treatments, mean residence times varied from 30 to 180 weeks and strong HFA effects (up to 80% faster decomposition at “home”) were found when litter from other sources was tested in old fruit-based agroforests. HFA indicates a local decomposer community well-adapted to its normal litter diet. Litter residence times of around two years are below the ap-parent peat formation threshold. Maintaining wet agroforest conditions adjacent to peat domes sup-ports peatland rewetting and restoration but does not contribute to on-site peat formation processes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial dams investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by dams in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future. © 2022

AB  - Peatland conversion for agriculture is the leading cause of Indonesia's terrestrial carbon emissions that contribute substantially to global warming. Indonesia's peatlands contain 55–57 billion tonnes of carbon, the equivalent of almost 2 years of global carbon emissions at existing rates. This paper examines initiatives to retain soil-based carbon in Indonesia's province of Riau, where over half the surface area is composed of agriculturally productive peatlands. We qualitatively evaluate three types of partnership programmes (bilateral, co-governed and internationally funded local initiatives) in Riau aimed at the sustainable development of peatlands. The article finds that carbon loss is likely to persist in all case studies. Public, private and civil society actors in each partnership have exploited funding and political opportunities to advance agendas not directly related to the environment. The administrative category of the peatland hydrological unit as an ecologically meaningful scale of peatland governance is also under-utilised by the partnerships studied. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Urban afforestation can mitigate the effects of air pollution, but the suitability of plant species for this purpose needs to be determined according to pollution intensity and climate change. The goal of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of different phytotoxicity endpoints using two native Brazilian plant species as models, Aroeira (Schinus terebinthifolius) and Cuvatã (Cupania vernalis). The sensitivity parameters evaluated could help in selecting the most air-pollution-tolerant plant species for use in urban afforestation programs. The two plant species were exposed, in a greenhouse, to the combustion gases of a diesel engine for 120 days, with daily intermittent gas exposure. Every 30 days, leaf injury (chlorosis and necrosis), biomass, and physiological/biochemical parameters (proteins, chlorophyll, and peroxidase enzyme activity) were evaluated for both plant species. For the two selected species, the endpoints studied can be ranked according to their sensitivity (or inversely the tolerance) to diesel oil combustion gases in the following order: peroxidase > biomass ≈ chlorophyll > protein > leaf injury. The endpoint responses of higher plants can be used to assess the suitability of particular plant species for use in urban afforestation areas with relatively intense vehicle traffic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Su-matran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau’s peat-land as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Artisanal gold mining has generated tailings highly contaminated by arsenic (As) in Cachoeira do Piriá, eastern Amazon, leading to severe risks to the environment. Such risks should be mitigated considering the bioavailable concentration of the element, since it implies immediate damage to the ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of biochars in mitigating the environmental risks of bioavailable As concentrations in gold mining tailings from underground and cyanidation exploration. The biochar addition increased mineral components, cation retention, phosphorus in all fractions, and organic and inorganic carbon. The bioavailability of As was reduced after adding the biochars, following the order palm kernel cake biochar > Brazil nut shell biochar > açaí seed biochar, with reductions of up to 13 mg kg−1 in the underground mining tailings and 17 mg kg−1 in the cyanidation mining tailings. These results contributed to the statistically significant reduction of the environmental risks in both mining tailings (6–17% in the underground mining tailings and 9–20% in the cyanidation mining tailings), which was emphasized by Pearson's correlation and multivariate analyzes. The incorporation of the bioavailable fractions of As (from sequential extraction) in the environmental risk assessment was a promising method for evaluating the efficiency of biochars in mitigating the damage caused by this metalloid in gold mining tailings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable coffee production is significantly threatened by climate change. While implementing CSA practices offers numerous benefits, adoption rates remain low. Coffee plantations are dominated by smallholders and located in rural areas, making them more complex and requiring a comprehensive analysis and intervention. This study used an exploratory approach to assess farmers’ preferences for CSA practices, identify barriers to implement, and design a support system model. The investigation focused on Arabica and Robusta farmers, with case studies from two Indonesian production centres. Preferences assessment used conjoint analysis, barriers evaluation used Mann–Whitney analysis, model development used synthetic approaches, and priority analysis used the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The study revealed that diversification is more desirable than cultivation, soil management, and water management. Arabica farmers preferred intercropping with annual crops, whereas Robusta farmers preferred perennials crops. Robusta farmers assessed that agricultural inputs, such as labor, capital, climatic data, and farm equipment and machinery, existed as barriers. However, these represent a lesser issue for Arabica farmers. We proposed agricultural innovation support system, consisting of innovation support facilities and services, as a comprehensive support system model to accelerate CSA implementation. Further analysis showed that the priority strategy for Arabica farmers is support services that focus on network development, while for Robusta farmers is support facilities that focus on climate information system development. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control.

AB  - Intensive agricultural production has negative environmental impacts, increasing predisposition to desertification in areas with inadequate soil management. To evaluate the effects of agriculture, we aimed to perform a temporal analysis and analyze the development of desertification in Northeast Brazil. Initially, the region was separated into four climatic zones, grouping the locations with similar characteristics of air temperature and rainfall. In the analyses, images of the northeast region acquired from the Landsat 5 (1989, 1999, and 2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellites were processed using the Google Earth Engine platform. The periods were separated into dry and rainy periods, according to the climatic zones. The evaluation of vegetation index, characterization of the remaining vegetation cover, landscape pattern, and meteorological conditions were performed, respectively, through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, and albedo of the terrestrial surface. The desertification index showed an increase in susceptible areas when comparing the interval from 1989 to 2019. In general, our results showed that there is less predisposition for desertification to occur during the rainy season. Also, when the results of our study were compared to official data released by the National Program of Action to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought, there was disagreement regarding the classification of areas. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats (‘apicuns’) i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former ‘apicum’ area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - Soil is a vital non-renewable natural resource for food production. Healthy, nutritious, and good-quality food is only produced through healthy soil. As the essential food commodity in Indonesia, rice is mainly cultivated in heavily degraded paddy soil, characterized by low organic C content and available N, P, and K nutrients. The challenges of increasing food demand due to increasing population, narrow agricultural land, and climate change lead to severe pressure on paddy fields. Monitoring soil quality is necessary to prevent the ongoing degradation of rice fields and threaten food security. This paper is a literature review that reveals the importance of evaluating soil quality and determining the limiting factors so that a soil health-based paddy soil management strategy can be sought to sustain food security. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Forest biomass plays an important role in carbon storage to mitigate climate change. While many studies have investigated the carbon stock of various forests, adding knowledge in the context of education forest might enrich the importance of this forest as a carbon pool besides its role for education purposes. Gunung Bromo Education Forest in Karanganyar District, Central Java, Indonesia consists of several tree cover types with each type having a different ability to absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This research aimed to determine the accumulation of biomass in Gunung Bromo Education Forest and to investigate the potential for carbon sequestration across different tree species, age classes and densities. Three species of tree (i.e. pine, Indonesian rosewood and mahogany) with varying ages were measured and calculated the biomass (i.e. tree, litter and understorey) and total carbon sequestration potentials (i.e. tree, litter and understorey, and soil organic carbon). This study used purposive sampling method across 9 combinations of tree cover type and age classes, each with 3 replication, resulting in a total of 27 sampling points. The results showed pine stands planted in 1973 had the highest tree biomass of 461.08 t ha-1 and while the pine agroforest planted in 2016 and Indonesian rosewood agroforest planted in 2018 had the lowest tree biomass with 1.02 t ha-1 and 0.39 t ha-1, respectively. Similarly, the pine stands planted in 1973 had the highest total carbon sequestration of 372.68 t ha-1 and the lowest in the pine agroforest planted in 2016 and Indonesian rosewood agroforest planted in 2018 with 187.11 t ha-1 and 193.58 t ha-1 respectively. The results of this study strengthen the common agreement in previous carbon studies that tree age strongly affects biomass accumulation and carbon sequestration, in which the older the plant, the higher the carbon sequestration potential than that of younger plants. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - The Guandu River, one of the main rivers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, provides water for more than nine million people in the metropolitan region. However, the Guandu has suffered from massive domestic and industrial pollution for more than two decades, leading to high levels of dissolved total phosphorus, cyanobacteria, and enteric bacteria observed during the summers of 2020 and 2021. The use of Phoslock, a palliative compound, was not effective in mitigating the levels of phosphorus in the Guandu River. Furthermore, potable water driven from the river had levels of 2-MIB/geosmin and a mud smell/taste. With all these problems, several solutions are proposed for improving the Guandu River water quality, including establishment of (i) sewage treatment plants (STPs), (ii) strict water quality monitoring, (iii) environmental recovery (e.g., reforestation), and (iv) permanent protected areas. The objective of this paper is to verify the poor water quality in the Guandu and the ineffectiveness and undesired effects of Phoslock. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural regeneration and the restoration course. However, most developed restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014) formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover, dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Peatlands support the daily needs of people in many villages in Indonesia, including in Central Kalimantan Province. They provide the natural resources to enable fisheries, agriculture, plantations, and forestry. However, peatland utilization comes with various challenges, including fire, soil acidity, inundation, low fertility, and limited choice of suitable species. Many of the current uses of peatland can result in its degradation, oxidation, and increased risk of peat fire. Avoiding further environmental degradation will require the development of new technology that allows the community to both earn a livelihood and protect the peatland. In this study we assessed a range of technologies applied by 14 farmers at Tumbang Nusa village, Central Kalimantan province, in managing degraded peatlands in their home yard for agricultural business. The study shows that for endemic peatland species, good success can be achieved if they are planted directly. However, for species endemic to mineral land, there are four technologies applied by farmers in managing degraded peatland. The choice of technologies is influenced by their economic capacity/cash flow flexibility and their understanding of peatlands. Technologies intended to adapt to land inundation include the use of polybags, development of raised beds, and making peat mounds with mineral soil in the centre. Technologies to address the acidity and soil fertility include amelioration with dolomite lime and fertilizer. The use of polybags filled with peat soil is the easiest technology to adopt and can be conducted by all family members. However, a farmer’s choice of technology needs to always consider the potential environmental impacts in addition to increasing soil fertility so that peat conservation is maintained. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Predicting the effect of climate change on rice yield is crucial as global food demand rap-idly increases with the human population. This study combined simulated daily weather data (MarkSim) and the CERES-Rice crop model from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software to predict rice production for three planting seasons under four climate change scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the years 2021 to 2050 in the Keduang subwater-shed, Wonogiri Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. The CERES-Rice model was calibrated and vali-dated for the local rice cultivar (Ciherang) with historical data using GenCalc software. The model evaluation indicated good performance with both calibration (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.89, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.88) and validation (R2 = 0.87, NSE = 0.76). Our results sug-gest that the predicted changing rainfall patterns, rising temperature, and intensifying solar radia-tion under climate change can reduce the rice yield in all three growing seasons. Under RCP 8.5, the impact on rice yield in the second dry season may decrease by up to 11.77% in the 2050s. Relevant strategies associated with policies based on the results were provided for decision makers. Further-more, to adapt the impact of climate change on rice production, a dynamic cropping calendar, mod-ernization of irrigation systems, and integrated plant nutrient management should be developed for farming practices based on our results in the study area. Our study is not only the first assessment of the impact of climate change on the study site but also provides solutions under projected rice shortages that threaten regional food security. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Tropical peatland stores a large amount of carbon. In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%–34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%–58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18–25 cm compared to 57–73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%–43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%–29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This study aimed to assess current perceptions of heat stress, heat strain, acclimatisation and recovery practices in wildland fire suppression. A total of 1459 wildfire and structural firefighters, all involved in wildland fire suppression, completed an 18-question survey. Most participants (81.3%) reported heat strain as one of the main risks faced during wildland firefighting. Thermal strain is considered an important risk for health and safety in wildland firefighting. The best-valued heat strain mitigation strategies were those traditionally recommended in wildland fire suppression: (i) an adequate work/rest ratio (79.0%), (ii) acclimatisation (71.6%), (iii) enhancing body ventilation by opening protective clothing or removing helmets or gloves (63.5%), and (iv) drinking water and food supplementation (52.1%). Despite these results, only 22% of the participants reported carrying out acclimatisation in the workplace. The vast majority of the respondents (87.4%) consider active cooling strategies (i.e., ice slurry ingestion, ice vests, etc.) impractical in combating heat strain during wildfire suppression. We identified a gap between knowledge about heat strain, its mitigation strategies and the level of actual implementation of these practices in the workplace. Our results highlight the need to improve heat strain management and implement operational directives for acclimatisation and active cooling interventions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of dry matter production by cover crops and their effects on the dynamics of organic matter, organic carbon and nitrogen in the soil. This study contributes to minimize the effect of climate change and improve agricultural production systems. The experiment was conducted under field conditions, in the experimental area of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rondônia, Colorado do Oeste Campus, in the municipality of Colorado do Oeste, RO, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, arranged in a factorial scheme, with four replications, consisting of six species of cover crops cultivated in pre-season (Crotalária ochroleuca, Crotalária spectabilis, Mucuna pruriens, Cajanus cajan, Canavalia ensiformis and Lablab purpureus) and four sampling depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm and 30-40 cm). The production and macronutrient contents in the dry mass of shoots of the different cover crops were evaluated, as well as the dynamics of organic matter, organic carbon and N in the soil at different sampling depths. The species Crotalaria ochroleuca and Crotalaria spectabilis showed great potential for dry matter production, while Lablab purpureus bean stands out in the extraction of nutrients such as P, K and Ca at full flowering. Lablab bean and Jack bean as cover crops were the most efficient strategies to promote the increase in the input of OM, C and N forms in the soil. NH+4-N and NO3-N contents were higher in the surface layers of the soil. Management with cover crops promoted gradual accumulation of SOM, which made it possible to influence the maintenance and increase of C and N concentrations in the soil and contributed to minimizing environmental impacts and increasing the quality and sustainability of soils and agricultural production systems. © 2022,Australian Journal of Crop Science.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) is a woody shrub with various characteristics that have made it useful in agroforestry systems. Recently, a biomass gasification power plant (BGPP) is engaging in extending calliandra plantations because of calliandra’s high heating value. Since the byproduct of BGPP is biochar, widely known for helping CO2 mitigation, this research aims to integrate biochar application into calliandra plantings. Experiments evaluating biochar applications were implemented on a new farm in Indonesia's Kundur Island, yielding calliandra wood for BGPP and fresh leaves for sheep farming. Chicken manure that had been co-composted with biochar was provided as fertilizer. In nursery experiments, the application of 1.1 kg m−2 biochar provided the greatest qualified seedlings. A field experiment showed that 1 or 1.25 kg m−2 biochar application yielded the most sizable wood and fresh leaves. The soil covering with biochar increased the yield of wood and fresh leaves, suggesting biochar mulching could be used for subsequent batches of calliandra regeneration. Thus, this study concluded that the application of biochar benefited calliandra nursery planting, field planting, and shoot regeneration. With a stable monthly temperature, the experiment site could have insufficient calliandra growth due to distinct dry and wet seasons. The regression analysis showed a strong correlation (R2 > 0.878) between wood production and rainfall, suggesting the growth of calliandra could be predicted from rainfall forecasts. Therefore, a calliandra agroforest system with biochar application and sufficient rainfall could enable a sustainable biomass supply for both BGPP and sheep farming. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The geo-position of Bantul Regency, which has open seas directly facing the Indian Ocean, is very vulnerable to tsunami and abrasion hazards, therefore disaster mitigation is needed in the form of restoring mangrove forest ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to assess the land suitability of mangrove restoration. The method used in this research is geospatial modelling that utilizes field surveys and interviews. The parameters tested consisted of maximum inundation, inundation frequency and land use. The results showed the potential for mangrove restoration as disaster mitigation at the Opak river estuary in Tirtohargo Village Kretek District and Rejosari Village in Sanden District. The Progo River estuary is also a mangrove restoration area in Poncosari Village, Srandakan District. After doing the geospatial analysis, it was found that the potential for mangrove forest restoration with a very suitable class was 168 ha and a suitable class was 181 ha. This mangrove forest is highly recommended because it physically has a coastal defence, protecting beaches and river banks, and prevents seawater abrasion. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change causes hydrometeorological disasters in Indonesia more frequently happen. One of them is drought. Drought reduces water availability and decreases agricultural production. It is necessary to select soil and water conservation techniques according to the level of vulnerability to mitigate losses. We researched Capluk Watershed which is often experiencing drought. The watershed is located on the Northern Coast of Java. The aims of this study were (1) to analyze the level of drought vulnerability and (2) to recommend drought mitigation measures. The drought vulnerability was analyzed spatially using a modification method proposed by Pramono and Savitri in 2019. The data used included rainfall, the number of dry months, actual annual evapotranspiration, geological formations, land systems, and distance to surface water sources. The analysis shows that 73% of the Capluk Watershed has a moderate vulnerability level to drought. The high level of vulnerability only exists in the upstream area, which is part of the karst landscape. We suggest that drought management focuses on the areas with moderate and high vulnerability levels. The community has been conducted water conservation by making ponds in the agricultural land and wells as water storage structures in the residential areas. In addition, we recommend several vegetative techniques such as planting annual crops with low evapotranspiration, and reforestation using Multi-purpose Tree Species (MPTS) or tree species with low evapotranspiration rates. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Implementation of resource recovery technologies is becoming increasingly important, as humans are exhausting the world's natural resources. Recovering nutrients and water from wastewater treatment systems will play an important role in changing the current trends towards a circular economy. However, guidance is still needed to determine the most appropriate way to do this. In this study two decision-support tools, sanitation planning software (Santiago) and life cycle assessment (LCA), were applied to identify appropriate technologies and their environmental impacts. As a case study, current and alternative scenarios for a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Campo Grande, west-central Brazil, were used. Among 12 scenarios provided by Santiago for efficient nutrient recovery, eight were selected for further assessment. The current WWTP system (UASB reactors) resulted in the highest negative impacts in two of nine assessment categories (freshwater and marine eutrophication), due to nutrient discharge to water. A source separation scenario with urine stored in a urine bank and co-composting of feces showed best overall performance. Electricity consumption played a crucial role for impacts in several categories, while water consumption was not significantly affected by choice of toilet. One Santiago scenario matched the most appropriate scenario with the best environmental performance, but the other seven scenarios were not as beneficial, indicating a need for some adjustments in the software. These results highlight the importance of performing LCA to compare alternative scenarios, even when using a tool designed to identify locally appropriate technologies. The results also indicate that the current wastewater treatment system has reasonable environmental performance, but could be improved if measures were taken to recover energy and reuse water. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Amazonia experienced unusually devastating fires in August 2019, leading to huge regional and global environmental and economic losses. The increase in fires has been largely attributed to anthropogenic deforestation, but anomalous climate conditions could also have contributed. This study investigates the climate influence on Amazonia fires in August 2019 and underlying mechanisms, based on statistical correlation and multiple linear regression analyses of 2001–2019 satellite-based fire products and multiple observational or reanalyzed climate datasets. Positive fire anomalies in August 2019 were mainly located in southern Amazonia. These anomalies were mainly driven by low precipitation and relative humidity, which increased fuel dryness and contributed to 38.9 ± 9.5% of the 2019 anomaly in pyrogenic carbon emissions over the southern Amazonia. The dry conditions were associated with southerly wind anomalies over southern Amazonia that suppressed the climatological southward transport of water vapor originating from the Atlantic. The southerly wind anomalies were caused by the combination of a Gill-type cyclonic response to the warmer North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), and enhancement of the Walker and Hadley circulations over South America due to the colder SST in the eastern Pacific, and a mid-latitude wave train triggered by the warmer condition in the western Indian Ocean. Our study highlights, for the first time, the important role of Indian Ocean SST for fires in Amazonia. It also reveals how cold SST anomalies in the tropical eastern Pacific link the warm phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the preceding December–January to the dry-season fires in Amazonia. Our findings can develop theoretical basis of global tropical SST-based fire prediction, and have potential to improve prediction skill of extreme fires in Amazonia and thus to take steps to mitigate their impacts which is urgency given that dry conditions led to the extreme fires are becoming common in Amazonia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To understand the financial feasibility of externally-driven community forestry management (CFM), this study assesses twelve CFM systems in the Brazilian Amazon classified as particularly successful by supporting organizations. The study showed that significant investments were necessary to set up the initiatives, including pre-financing the annual operational costs. Only three of the twelve management systems were found to be financially viable. These successful cases were able to follow the Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) guidelines due to the large scale of their operations. The smaller initiatives were not financially autonomous. The findings indicate that the legal regulations and technical principles of the CFM approach do not correspond to the capacities and realities of typical local forest users in the Brazilian Amazon. There is an urgent need to better adapt this approach to the interests and capacities of local resource users. © 2022 Commonwealth Forestry Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the perspective of using cocoa as a response to climate change, a preliminary carbon stock assessment was conducted in cocoa agroforests of the Bengamisa-Yangambi forest landscape in the north-east of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were collected in 25 plots of 2500 m2 each, spread over 16 villages. Above-ground carbon stock assessment on cocoa trees and their associated plants revealed that cocoa agroforests store on average 44.48 Mg ha−1 of above-ground carbon of which, cocoa-associated plants represent 83.68%. The diversity (species richness) of cocoa associated plants determine the level of above-ground carbon stored in cocoa agroforests. Trees less than 50 cm in diameter stored a larger amount of above-ground carbon. Cocoa agroforests with associated plants dominated by forest species (Model F) store 1.76 and 1.72 times more carbon, respectively, than those where associated plants are dominated by oil palm (Model P) and a mixture of plant types (forest species mixed with oil palm plants, or Model FP). Associated plants inside cocoa agroforests also play additional roles to support livelihoods such as health care, household consumption and timber. Therefore, beyond carbon storage, cocoa agroforest is an important reservoir of some local species and thus useful for biodiversity conservation and local livelihoods. As cocoa agroforests in DRC are recognized as one of the main responses to climate change, this study constitutes an early contribution to the process of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) in forest landscapes in this country of the Congo Basin. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: The Cerrado of central Brazil—the world’s largest Neotropical savanna – is comprised of a mosaic of highly heterogeneous vegetation growing on an extremely diverse geologic and geomorphologic background. Geomorphic processes under stable tectonic and climatic conditions facilitated the development of diverse edaphic properties, which interact with disturbance events to form unique vegetation types. Scope: In this review, we detail how the geophysical environment affects soil formation and evaluate the mechanisms through which edaphic conditions control vegetation structure, floristic diversity and functional diversity. Conclusion: The influence of geomorphic processes on edaphic properties has a marked impact on the ecology and evolution of plant communities. Species exhibit morphological and physiological adaptations that optimise their successful establishment in particular soil conditions. Furthermore, fire disturbance alters these soil-vegetation associations further regulating the structural nature of these communities. Therefore, we propose an integrative view where edaphic, chemical and physical properties act as modulators of vegetation stands, and these conditions interact with the fire regime. The knowledge of plant edaphic niches, their functional traits related to resource acquisition and use, as well as the interaction of edaphic properties and disturbance regimes is paramount to research planning, conservation, and successful restoration of the full diversity of Cerrado vegetation types. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Brazil has experienced huge areas of forest loss over recent decades with an estimated removal of 80 MHa of natural forest since 1990. Deforestation creates substantial greenhouse emissions that have historically dominated all other sectors. Effective governance has reduced deforestation and net land-use emissions have fallen by 74% since the mid-2000s. Anthropogenic carbon removal from secondary forest regrowth and protected areas has increased by 62%, which has helped drive the reduction in net emissions, offsetting gross emissions which have fallen by 44%. Major Brazilian biomes, such as the Atlantic Forest are net-sinks and the Amazon was near net-zero in 2010. Deforestation has increased over the last 10-years and now stands at a decadal high in the Amazon region. These increases in deforestation put Brazil at risk of missing its original National Determined Contribution; however, the recent revision has substantially increased the 2005 baseline and therefore the overall target. Carbon removals in the forest sector play an increasingly important role in reducing emissions and achieving the NDC. The Brazilian target of achieving 12 MHa of reforestation and restoration has the potential to further offset emissions through enhanced regrowth. However, the natural carbon sinks of Brazil are weakening. The Amazon forest is the single largest Brazilian biome for natural carbon uptake but when combined with land-use emissions has seen a net loss over the last 30 years. The natural sink remains large, but ecosystem resilience is declining driven by global and local climate change linked to rising international emissions and changing circulation patterns associated with local deforestation and degradation. These combine to make realizing the huge potential for carbon removal more challenging. It remains evident that forest protection and avoided degradation and disturbance is the best way to mitigate emissions and reduce climate impacts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector has significant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. Besides reducing deforestation and forest degradation, plantation development also plays an important role in climate change mitigation, particularly for carbon stock enhancement. This study aims to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan. Rubber plantation carbon stock was measured by establishing 24 sample plots with the size of 20x20 m in two locations, Kutai Timur and Penajam Paser Utara regencies. Above-ground biomass of rubber was estimated using the allometric equation AGB = 0.144 x D2.40. While the carbon stock was further calculated using the lifetime average approach. The result shows that the carbon stock of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan is 75.71 tons C ha-1. With a total plantation area of 123,460 ha, the potential carbon sequestration of rubber plantations in East Kalimantan is about 9.05 Mt, equivalent to 33.19 Mt CO2e. Given the high carbon sequestration potential, rubber plantation development needs to be considered as an important strategy to achieve FOLU net sink by 2030. This is part of the enhancement of carbon stock through land rehabilitation, which is prioritized to be implemented in degraded lands to avoid deforestation and forest degradation in forested areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The hydrological condition can be determined by investigating local data or analyzing historical climatological records. Several methods can approach the wetland condition, including peatland in general. The definition of physical properties to assess critical groundwater table depths is one of them. Another way is to define the requirements in the area that can be approached by determining the condition of the wetland area for general. Understanding and assessing the wetland state is necessary to measure and evaluate the wetland situation, and it can be done by analyzing wetland hydrology parameters. Due to the necessity to mitigate change conditions in a wetland, it is common to know that either flood or drought will derive a difficult situation both in a wetland and a peatland but especially for a peatland, drought condition is severe. This study aims to observe the wetland condition and identify whether the wetland area has drought risk potential, especially in the peatland site. The study was conducted by directly taking data from the study location and downloading satellite data from local and regional websites: the local climatology agency Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi dan Geofisika (BMKG Indonesia), and the Jaxa website. The data from satellite needs to be used related to the limitation of ground data in the study location. The result showed that the satellite has an excellent relationship to the ground data with a pretty low root mean square error (RMSE) number. In addition, it showed the correlation between the amount of monthly rainfall and evapotranspiration with the water table elevation. It can be concluded at the initial conclusion that the decreased rainfall and the high evapotranspiration in a particular month can be expected the drought risk potentially will happen.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we analyze transformations within a land reform settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, with special land-use regulations targeting forest conservation. We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatobá Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social-ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding both carbon and nitrogen temporal and spatial inputs by rainfall in tropical forests is critical for proper forest conservation and management and might ultimately elucidate how climate change might affect nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems. This study aimed to quantify the net precipitation contribution to the Atlantic Forest's total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), identifying potential differences between these inputs regarding temporal (seasonal and monthly) and spatial scales. Rainfall samples were collected before and after interacting with the forest canopy from May 2018 to April 2019. The rainfall was enriched after crossing the forest canopy. Significant differences were found for gross rainfall and net precipitation between annual carbon (104.13 kg ha-1 and 193.18 kg ha-1) and nitrogen (16.81 kg ha-1 and 36.95 kg ha-1) inputs, respectively. Moreover, there was seasonal variability in the C and N inputs with 75% occurring in the wet season. Overall, the spatial patterns revealed that the same locations had the highest inputs regardless of the analyzed period. The forest-rainfall interactions provide constant C and N inputs, especially in the wet season, and are fundamental for the maintenance of ecological processes.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Silviculture has great importance worldwide, and the use of Eucalyptus species, which account for 75% of the local planted forest in Brazil, is one of the factors that contributes to the success of this activity in the country. Despite its adaptability, the yield of Eucalyptus is often affected by climate change, particularly water deficiency. Plants have developed strategies to mitigate water stress, for example, through their association with mycorrhizal fungi. The genus Eucalyptus, particularly in the plant domain, establishes symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF). The influence of Eucalyptus species on AMF and soil quality indicators is not well understood. Our aim was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the various responses of soil AMF communities and soil nutrient dynamics in the presence of Eucalyptus species with different degrees of drought tolerance. A field experiment was established containing six Eucalyptus species, E. brassiana, E. camaldulensis, E. citriodora, E. cloeziana, E. grandis, and E. urophylla, all of which were planted in large plots. Soil and root samples were taken when the plants were 1.7 and 2.2 years old. We found that Eucalyptus species with low (E. grandis and E. urophylla) and intermediate drought tolerance (E. citriodora and E. cloeziana) showed stronger correlations with the AMF community than Eucalyptus species with high drought tolerance (E. brassiana and E. camaldulensis). Differences were also found between Eucalyptus species for AMF spore numbers and root colonization percentages, which was most evident for E. urophylla. The microbiological attributes found to be most responsive to Eucalyptus species were soil enzyme activities, AMF spore numbers, root colonization percentages, and fungal abundance. Soil organic carbon, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, and iron were the main chemical drivers related to the soil AMF community structure in the presence of E. brassiana.

AB  - (1) Background: The management of forest and land fires has become of concern to the Indonesian government, as demonstrated by the issuing of the Presidential Instruction of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2015, then replaced by Number 3 of 2020, concerning Forest and Land Fire Management. In 2002, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) established Manggala Agni, a forest fire management organization, at the central government level. This study aims to explain the development of the Indonesian Forest and Land Fire Prevention Patrol System. The system development was conducted by the Computer Science Department of IPB University, in collaboration with the Agency for Climate Change and Forest and Land Fire Management, as well as the Directorate of Forest and Land Fire Management, MoEF. (2) Methods: The system development adopted the steps in the prototyping method, namely communication, quick planning, rapid design modeling, and prototype construction, as well as dissemination, submission, and feedback. (3) Results: The web-based system for the real-time monitoring and analysis of the forest and land fire prevention patrol is integrated into a mobile application for recording field observations during patrol activities. The system testing was successfully conducted by involving the users. The test results show that all features in the system are working correctly and meet the user’s requirements. The mobile application has saved 36.02% of the time for recording the patrol data and 40.32% for creating the patrol reports. In addition, using the web-based application has saved time in preparing the patrol reports by 56.48%. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change will have a significant impact on the water cycle and will lead to severe environmental problems and disasters in humid tropical river basins. Examples include river basins in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, where the coastal lowland areas are mostly composed of peatland that is a wetland environment initially sustained by flooding from rivers. Climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of flood inundation in these lowland areas, disturbing the peatland environment and its carbon dynamics and damaging agricultural plantations. Consequently, projecting the extent of inundation due to future flooding events is considered important for river basin management. Using dynamically downscaled climate data obtained by the Non-Hydrostatic Regional Climate Model (NHRCM), the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was applied to the Batanghari River Basin (42,960 km2) in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, to project the extent of flood inundation in the latter part of the twenty-first century. In order to obtain reasonable estimates of the extent of future flood inundation, this study compared two bias correction methods: a Quantile Mapping (QM) method and a combination of QM and Variance Scaling (VS) methods. The results showed that the bias correction obtained by the QM method improved the simulated flow duration curve (FDC) obtained from the RRI model, which facilitated comparison with the simulated FDC using reference rainfall data. However, the high spatial variability observed in daily and 15-day rainfall data remained as the spatial variation bias, and this could not be resolved by simple QM bias correction alone. Consequently, the simulated extreme variables, such as annual maximum flood inundation volume, were overestimated compared to the reference data. By introducing QM-VS bias correction, the cumulative density functions of annual maximum discharge and inundation volumes were improved. The findings also showed that flooding will increase in this region; for example, the flood inundation volume corresponding to a 20-year return period will increase by 3.3 times. River basin management measures, such as land use regulations for plantations and wetland conservation, should therefore consider increases in flood depth and area, the extents of which under a future climate scenario are presented in this study.

AB  - The plantation of fast-growing tree species plays a crucial role in supplying forest products to growing economies while relieving pressure on native forests reducing the overexploitation of native ecosystems. Grown in more than 90 countries, Eucalyptus spp. are fast-growing tree species driving economic production comprising pulp, wood, or thermal energy. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme drought episodes: the 2019 drought in Mato Grosso, Brazil, was the second driest episode ever recorded. Forest inventory data comprising thousands of individual tree measurements collected in consecutive surveys - years 2019, 2020, 2021 – were modelled with mixed-effects models to identify significant factors influencing tree mortality after drought. Time-series of growth dynamics of the four eucalypt commercial clones were tested. For the landscape assessment, surveys using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported a high-resolution image mosaicking to derive digital surface models and the vegetation indexes driving segmentation and classification methods using ground plot-level observations as training data. The impact of drought was measured in terms of mortality, growth dynamics and the financial losses computed when valuing the 1400-ha plantation along the 3-year series. The modelling results showed high-stocking plantations suffered more from extreme water-stress conditions. The interaction between stocking and clone was analysed. On average, the 2019 drought triggered an estimate loss of $3500 per hectare. The estimation of live and dead conditions using UAV-based outcomes reached an overall accuracy of 89% and 0.7 in the Cohen's kappa used to map forest health wall-to-wall. Our findings advocate for a reduction of tree planting density and enhanced clone selection to turn eucalypt plantations more resilient to extreme water-stress. Combining UAV-based remote sensing technology, ground truth data and management expertise in eucalypt management eases the operationalization of data-driven solutions towards more resilient silvicultural guidelines and increased efficiency of forest plantations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Brazilian agricultural sector is largely responsible for nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions, mainly due to beef cattle and the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, Brazil is looking for measures, such as integrated crop–livestock–forestry (ICLF), to increase productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. The forest component within this system plays a positive role in the context of climate change, soil conservation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, and biodiversity protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of management and rainfall on N2O emissions in eucalypt monoculture soils and eucalypt soils in ICLF systems. Manual static chambers were used to collect gas samples, from November 2013 to October 2014, in four treatments, i.e., one eucalypt monoculture (F) and three modalities of ICLF (livestock–forest [LF], livestock–crop–forest [LCF], and integrated crop–livestock–forest [ICLF]). A gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector was used to measure the N2O concentrations. The results showed that rainfall considerably affected N2O fluxes across all the treatments, indicating that rainfall is the main factor in increasing emissions. During the wet season, the N2O levels ranged from 0.158 to 0.482 kg N-N2O ha-1 across all treatments. During the dry season, all treatments behaved like sinks of N2O. Moreover, N2O flux did not differ between the soils in the eucalypt monoculture and ICLF systems. This indicates that the forestry component in the ICLF systems did not affect N2O soil fluxes. © 2022, Australian Journal of Crop Science. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are subject to subsidence in recent years, resulting in significant soil organic carbon loss. Their degradation is responsible for several environmental issues; however, understanding the causes of peatland subsidence is of prime concern for implementing mitigation measures. Here, we employed time-series Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using ALOS PALSAR-2 images to assess the relationship between subsidence rates and land use/land cover (LULC) change (including drainage periods) derived from decadal Landsat data (1972–2019). Overall, the study area subsided with a mean rate of −2.646 ± 1.839 cm/year in 2018–2019. The subsidence rates slowed over time, with significant subsidence decreases in peatlands after being drained for 9 years. We found that the long-time persistence of vegetated areas leads to subsidence deceleration. The relatively lower subsidence rates are in areas that changed to rubber/mixed plantations. Further, the potential of subsidence prediction was assessed using Random Forest (RF) regression based on LULC change, distance from peat edge, and elevation. With an R2 of 0.532 (RMSE = 0.594 cm/year), this machine learning method potentially enlarges the spatial coverage of InSAR method for the higher frequency SAR data (such as Sentinel-1) that mainly have limited coverage due to decorrelation in vegetated areas. According to feature importance in the RF model, the contribution of LULC change (including drainage period) to the subsidence model is comparable with distance from peat edge and elevation. Other uncertainties are from unexplained factors related to drainage and peat condition, which need to be accounted for as well. This work shows the significance of decadal LULC change analysis to supplement InSAR measurement in tropical peatland subsidence monitoring programs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil’s traditional cacao region, cacao is mostly grown under the shade of thinned Atlantic Forest (known as cabruca). These agroforestry systems are gradually being replaced by unshaded cacao monocultures that might be more vulnerable to changes in climate; however, the impacts of climate change have not been evaluated yet. We assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of cacao plantations in southern Bahia and evaluated to what extent the cabrucas reduce the vulnerability of cacao as compared to unshaded plantations. We measured the maximum temperature in a gradient of canopy cover during the warmest month of the year and projected ecological niche models (MaxEnt) on climate projections for 2050 simulating the microclimate of three production systems: cabrucas, intermediate shading, and unshaded plantations. We found that canopy cover drastically reduces daily maximum temperature, so that understory temperature in cabrucas can be up to 6.0 °C lower than in unshaded plantations. We show for the first time that all projected environmental changes negatively affect cacao in southern Bahia, diminishing its climatic suitability and reducing overall suitable areas across the region. More importantly, this study is the first one to show that cabrucas can reduce the negative impacts of climate change for cacao, especially where temperature extremes approach or exceed crop tolerance limits. We conclude that maximizing short-term profits by implementing unshaded monocultures will likely lead to production losses in the long term. Cabrucas have a central role in reducing the vulnerability of cacao to climate change and since these traditional agroforestry systems cannot be quickly restored, their conservation should be an important goal of agricultural policies in the region. © 2022, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Community engagement and integrated research are key approaches to solving complex socio-ecological challenges. This paper describes the experience of bringing together a team of natural and social scientists from Australia and Indonesia in the ‘Gambut Kita’ (translated as ‘Our Peat’) project. Gambut Kita aims to produce new knowledge and support efforts to successfully, and equitably, restore Indonesia’s tropical peatlands and ensure that livelihoods can be maintained on restored (rewetted) landscapes. The paper focuses on experiences of using community engagement for integrated research. It discusses three community engagement approaches used in the project—resilience, adaptation pathways and transformation approach (RAPTA), participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and community-led analysis and planning (CLAP). It also describes the qualitative analysis of 14 interviews with the project team of lessons learned in community engagement for integrated research. ‘Criteria for success’ from the literature on international development projects is used to assess progress. The findings highlight the specific complexities of working across countries and cultures. Successful community engagement is not so much about the ‘tool’ but about the trust, agency, and support to change. The tools do, however, have different strengths. PRA and CLAP can build deep community understanding and relationships. RAPTA has strengths in framing visions and pathways to the future, systems thinking, anticipatory learning, and taking a cross-scale systems view which is required to solve many of the problems manifesting at local or community scales. Similarly, success in integrated research is not just about individuals, but structures (e.g. explicit process) and infrastructure (e.g. access to technology). These findings suggest that integrated research needs special considerations in terms of design, and these relate across scales to individual researchers as well as teams, leaders and organisations. Integrated research projects need careful, inclusive, iterative management with a lot of interaction to learn from each other, build a common vision, achieve clarity of roles, and share emerging findings. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - Soil salinization and sodification, caused by inadequate land management, is one of the main threats to the semiarid agroecosystems. It is essential to investigate saline levels under different land-use conditions to maintain the sustainability of agricultural production. The main objective of this study was to diagnose the salinity status of the soil in different land-use conditions in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Soil samples were collected in the surface layer (0–5 cm) of three different land-use conditions: areas of low salinity (native vegetation – Caatinga), areas of different saline levels (cultivated areas), and areas of very high salinity (desertified by salinity), and compared regarding the chemical attributes of the soils by descriptive and multivariate analysis. The results showed that sodium and chloride were the predominant soluble ions in cultivated and desertified areas due to saline waters commonly used in the study region. Increases in electrical conductivity values of 1219 and 23207% were observed for cultivated and desertified areas, respectively, compared to areas of native vegetation. The principal component analysis contributed to identifying parameters responsible for the variation in soil salinity, and the second factor identified that percentage of exchangeable sodium, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable and soluble sodium plays an essential role in soil desertification. However, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride ions correlated positively with variables that degrade soils - EC, ESP, and SAR. We also found that in desertified areas, in addition to chloride, sulfate is also present in expressive levels, and due to the strong associations with calcium, magnesium, and sodium, our study suggests that in addition to the free forms of these ions, the forms of chlorides and sulfates of calcium, magnesium, and sodium also effectively contribute to the degradation of the areas. The combination of multivariate analysis × geochemistry × laboratory techniques was a valuable tool to identify and monitor saline levels in converting uncultivated to cultivated areas and from cultivated areas to desertified areas. © 2022

AB  - Plants adapted to different habitats exhibit differences in functional traits and these characteristics are influenced by soil properties. We tested the hypothesis that soil resource availability influences the functional traits of plants, affecting therefore herbivory levels. We examined three Byrsonima plant species with different life forms that occurred across a distinct edaphic habitat along the Doce River Basin, South-eastern Brazil. We characterized habitats according to soil nutrient concentration and measured functional characteristics of crown architecture, leaf nutrients, sclerophylly, leaf area and leaf density. In addition, we evaluated how these variables influenced herbivory levels of congeneric plants. Our data show that species along a gradient of soil nutrients have functional characteristics influenced by habitat, which in turn affect herbivory levels. By comparing congeners with different life forms found along a stress-gradient of continuous habitats, we describe a corresponding gradient of plant functional traits and tissue consumption by herbivorous insects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Water management is the leading key to success in tidal swamp rice farming of acid sulfate soils toward seasonal and climate changes to increase rice productivity for overcoming the threat of food crisis. This study aimed to assess and know the dynamics of tidal water quality from the dry peak season to the rainy season's peak and the best practices on tidal water management strategies for rice cultivation in acid sulfate soils. Measurement started from the peak of the dry season to that of the rainy season, carried out every month at the spring and neap tides. The first measurement was conducted in the Ray 5 Channel located 3 km from the Barito River, hourly for 24 hours. The second one was performed every kilometer from the Barito's Riverbanks up to 8 km during high and low tides. The main parameters measured were pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The results explained that water quality in tidal lands dynamically fluctuated, spatially, and temporally, hourly, daily, and monthly. Spatially, good water quality is only found at locations 0-4km on the water channel from the Barito River. The water quality decreases farther from the estuary channel and towards the rain peak. The best water quality in the channel occurs at the in-situ tide peak, usually for 2-3hours closest to or from the highest tide. However, the water quality is very acidic, with the pHa 1/43 value often overflowing the land at the height of the rainy season. This research can be used as a guide in water management in acid sulfate soils and other similar locations. Proper management and location-specific and compatible water systems are proposed to ensure good quality water can optimally improve agricultural success in tidal swamps of acid sulfate soils, namely by holding backwater during the dry season, water drain from the swampland in the rainy season, with leaching and flushing at the beginning rain, and closing the floodgates from the poor water quality.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In Brazil, forest conservation policies have centered primarily on the Amazon rainforest, given its significance to the actual discussion on climate change. Until 2018, and under a period of rigorous macroeconomic conditions, Brazil had successfully decreased Amazon’s deforestation by strengthening national environmental policies. On the other hand, in 2015, the Brazilian government had institutionalized the Matopiba region, placed in the northeast of the Cerrado biome. In the present study, we used linear and spatial regression models to evaluate determinant factors of land-use change in the southwest region of Piauí, Brazil, placed among Cerrado and Caatinga biomes. We considered determinant factors: distribution and proportions of deforestation and significant temporary agricultural products. Our results show that the natural vegetation represented 69.68% of the total area in 2016. The distance to roads variable does not play a substantive function in defining the deforestation patterns (Coef. = − 0.03). We found that variables as distance to ports, large proprieties size, and land price significantly impact land-use transition models. Also, the study shows that protected areas have reduced the probability of deforestation in the region (Coef. = − 0.22). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Forest loss is one of the most serious threats to biodiversity in the tropics and mainly occurs due to the conversion of native forests by the expansion of human activities. In addition, regional climate change is likely to adversely affect the remaining biota. These disturbances may have direct or indirect consequences on the demographic structure of plant species in human-modified landscapes. To test this hypothesis, and thus look for management practices aimed at enhancing the population viability, we used the palm species Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae) to assess the demographic structure of five ontogenetic stages prior (2014) and after (2017) a prolonged drought event (2015) that occurred in the northeastern Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We also investigated the influence of landscape forest cover on the ontogenetic demographic structure, given that forest remnants were embedded within landscapes ranging from 6 to 97% of forest amount. We revealed that forest cover was a key predictor explaining the abundance patterns of E. edulis, with all ontogenetic stages (except seedlings, immature, and adults) exhibiting lower abundance in forest remnants surrounded by lower amount of native forests. Conversely, the regional drought event unaffected the demographic structure of this palm species, which may suggest that populations of E. edulis were able to cope with an isolated, though severe, drought event. The impacts of forest loss on E. edulis demographic structure, particularly on juveniles, raises a concern about the future persistence of E. edulis populations, since the early stages represent the adult generation in the near future. Management measures, including species reintroduction, forest restoration, environmental education programmes and the enforcement of environmental laws must be encouraged to safeguard E. edulis populations in the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The mangrove is an ecosystem bounded by the line of the largest tide in size that occurs in climatic and subtropical regions. In this environment, microorganisms and their enzymes are involved in a series of transformations and nutrient cycling. To evaluate the biotechnological potential of fungi from a mangrove ecosystem, samples from mangrove trees were collected at the Paranaguá Estuarine Complex in Brazil and 40 fungal isolates were obtained, cultivated, and screened for hydrolytic and ligninolytic enzymes production, adaptation to salinity and genetic diversity. The results showed a predominance of hydrolytic enzymes and fungal tolerance to ≤ 50 g L−1 sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration, a sign of adaptive halophilia. Through morphological and molecular analyses, the isolates were identified as: Trichoderma atroveride, Microsphaeropsis arundinis, Epicoccum sp., Trichoderma sp., Gliocladium sp., Geotrichum sp. and Cryphonectria sp. The ligninolytic enzymatic potential of the fungi was evaluated in liquid cultures in the presence and absence of seawater and the highest activity of laccase among isolates was observed in the presence of seawater with M. arundinis (LB07), which produced 1,037 U L−1. Enzymatic extracts of M. arundinis fixed at 100 U L−1 of laccase partially decolorized a real textile effluent in a reaction without pH adjustment and chemical mediators. Considering that mangrove fungi are still few explored, the results bring an important contribution to the knowledge about these microorganisms, as their ability to adapt to saline conditions, biodegradation of pollutants, and enzymatic potential, which make them promising candidates in biotechnological processes. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - There has been widespread clearance of tropical forests for agriculture, but in many cases the cultivation phase is only transient. The secondary forests recovering on these abandoned sites may contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and protection of biodiversity, but the rates of recovery may be dependent on land-use intensity and changes in soil properties during cultivation. However fine-scale details on these changes are poorly known for many tropical forest locations. We quantified soil properties and recovery of woody biomass in 42 tropical forest fragments representing a chronosequence following two types of agricultural land-uses, and in 15 comparable reference old growth forests, between the Andes and the Amazon in Peru. Soil fertility, particularly base cation concentrations, responded negatively to increasing intensity of agricultural land-use, and either decreased or increased with time after abandonment dependent on prior land-use. The predicted mean recovery rate of woody biomass over the first 20 years following abandonment matched that predicted by a general model for the Neotropics, but recovery was three-fold higher on sites abandoned following traditional agriculture than on sites recovering from intensive agriculture. Estimated total biomass recovered to just above half that of reference old growth forests within 71 years. The inclusion of the biomass of lianas and smaller tree stems did not modify the apparent rate of ecosystem biomass recovery, however the proportion of the total biomass stored in small stems was greater following intensive than traditional agriculture, which suggests that patterns of stand structural development are sensitive to land-use history. We conclude that effects of historic land use on soil nutrient concentrations and their changes through time are required for a more complete interpretation of variation in biomass recovery rates at local scales. These results also highlight the critical importance of contemporary agricultural intensification for carbon storage in tropical forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cattle ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The rainforest-to-pasture conversion affects the methane cycle in upland soils, changing it from sink to source of atmospheric methane. However, it remains unknown if management practices could reduce the impact of land-use on methane cycling. In this work, we evaluated how pasture management can regulate the soil methane cycle either by maintaining continuous grass coverage on pasture soils, or by liming the soil to amend acidity. Methane fluxes from forest and pasture soils were evaluated in moisture-controlled greenhouse experiments with and without grass cover (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) or liming. We also assessed changes in the soil microbial community structure of both bare (bulk) and rhizospheric pasture soils through high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and quantified the methane cycling microbiota by their respective marker genes related to methane generation (mcrA) or oxidation (pmoA). The experiments used soils from eastern and western Amazonia, and concurrent field studies allowed us to confirm greenhouse data. The presence of a grass cover not only increased methane uptake by up to 35% in pasture soils, but also reduced the abundance of the methane-producing community. In the grass rhizosphere this reduction was up to 10-fold. Methane-producing archaea belonged to the genera Methanosarcina sp., Methanocella sp., Methanobacterium sp., and Rice Cluster I. Further, we showed that soil liming to increasing pH compromised the capacity of forest and pasture soils to be a sink for methane, and instead converted formerly methane-consuming forest soils to become methane sources in only 40–80 days. Liming reduced the relative abundance of Beijerinckiacea family in forest soils, which account for many known methanotrophs. Our results demonstrate that pasture management that maintains grass coverage can mitigate soil methane emissions, compared to bare (bulk) pasture soil. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Earth's forests harbor extensive biodiversity and are currently a major carbon sink. Forest conservation and restoration can help mitigate climate change; however, climate change could fundamentally imperil forests in many regions and undermine their ability to provide such mitigation. The extent of climate risks facing forests has not been synthesized globally nor have different approaches to quantifying forest climate risks been systematically compared. We combine outputs from multiple mechanistic and empirical approaches to modeling carbon, biodiversity, and disturbance risks to conduct a synthetic climate risk analysis for Earth's forests in the 21st century. Despite large uncertainty in most regions we find that some forests are consistently at higher risk, including southern boreal forests and those in western North America and parts of the Amazon. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - Pollination services, from both wild and managed populations of insect pollinators, have degraded as a result of agricultural intensification. Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (β = 0.418 ± SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (β = 0.845 ± SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Phlebotomines are a group of insects which include vectors of the Leishmania parasites that cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), diseases primarily affecting populations of low socioeconomic status. VL in Brazil is caused by Leishmania infantum, with transmission mainly attributed to Lutzomyia longipalpis, a species complex of sand fly, and is concentrated mainly in the northeastern part of the country. CL is distributed worldwide and occurs in five regions of Brazil, at a higher incidence in the north and northeast regions, with etiological agents, vectors, reservoirs and epidemiological patterns that differ from VL. The aim of this study was to determine the composition, distribution and ecological relationships of phlebotomine species in an Atlantic Forest conservation unit and nearby residential area in northeastern Brazil. Methods: Centers for Disease Control and Shannon traps were used for collections, the former at six points inside the forest and in the peridomestic environment of surrounding residences, three times per month for 36 months, and the latter in a forest area, once a month for 3 months. The phlebotomines identified were compared with climate data using simple linear correlation, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and cross-correlation. The estimate of ecological parameters was calculated according to the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, standardized index of species abundance and the dominance index. Results: A total of 75,499 phlebotomines belonging to 11 species were captured in the CDC traps, the most abundant being Evandromyia walkeri, Psychodopygus wellcomei and Lu. longipalpis. Evandromyia walkeri abundance was most influenced by temperature at collection time and during the months preceding collection and rainfall during the months preceding collection. Psychodopygus wellcomei abundance was most affected by rainfall and relative humidity during the collection month and the month immediately preceding collection time. Lutzomyia longipalpis abundance showed a correlation with temperature and the rainfall during the months preceding collection time. The Shannon trap contained a total of 3914 phlebotomines from these different species. Psychodopygus wellcomei, accounting for 91.93% of the total, was anthropophilic and active mainly at night. Conclusions: Most of the species collected in the traps were seasonal and exhibited changes in their composition and population dynamics associated with local adaptions. The presence of vectors Ps. wellcomei and Lu. longipalpis underscore the epidemiological importance of these phlebotomines in the conservation unit and surrounding anthropized areas. Neighboring residential areas should be permanently monitored to prevent VL or CL transmission and outbreaks.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of bioenergy to replace fossil energy has grown in recent years, raising concerns about the “carbon (C) neutrality” of bioenergy and the benefits of its use to enhance energy security and mitigate climate change. In Brazil, sugarcane ethanol is a feasible option and can result in negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through replacement of fossil fuels. This study evaluated the direct deforestation triggered by sugarcane expansion in Mata Atlântica and Cerrado biomes considering the periods of intense expansion from 2002 to 2008 and the stagnation of sugarcane production from 2009 to 2016. The expansion and associated land use changes (LUC) were evaluated and quantified to address direct effects on deforestation, soil C stocks, and associated GHG emissions/removals in two Brazilian watersheds. Most of deforestation in both biomes occurred before 2002. Two percent of the sugarcane expansion caused direct deforestation between 2002 and 2008. From 2009 to 2016, 3% of the new sugarcane areas were located outside the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning program. Regarding the assessed basins, almost six times more deforestation was observed in Goiás basin (~ 15,000 ha) than in São Paulo basin (~ 2500 ha). Deforestation in Goiás basin was strongly linked to expansion of annual crops, while in São Paulo basin reforestation has occurred. Lastly, sugarcane expansion had negligible impacts on the overall soil C budget for both basins. This assessment is an important step forward for incorporating LUC-induced emissions to develop and evaluate GHG mitigation strategies towards greater sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

In the case of Coffea arabica L., the use of agroforestry systems (AFS) with woody species is a promising practice to reduce excessive heat during the day. This study aimed to 1) evaluate air temperature changes that occur in an AFS of coffee and double alleys of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Müell. Arg.) and 2) carry out an analysis of future warming scenarios by comparing the cultivation of Arabic coffee in full sun and in an AFS of double alleys of rubber trees. The microclimatic variables were measured between two rows of coffee trees at 1.0 m of height from June 2016 to June 2018. The results indicate that the AFS with double alleys of rubber trees spaced 16 m apart had an average temperature reduction from 1.4 to 2.5 °C from 10h00 to 16h00. The study also simulated temperature increases of 1.7, 2.6, 3.1, and 4.8 °C from 2018 to 2099, according to scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the impact in coffee production in Paraná State, Brazil. Using the climatic generator PGECLIMA_R, simulations suggest a progressive reduction of traditional areas suitable for open-grown coffee in the state. Production conditions can be maintained through the AFS, since the systems attenuate mean temperatures by 1-2 °C. We conclude that the AFS of coffee and rubber trees contribute to coffee crop adaptations to a future warmer environment. © 2022, University of Sao Paolo. All rights reserved.

AB  - With 120 million hectares of forest area, Indonesia has the third largest area of biodiversity-rich tropical forests in the world, and it is well-known as a mega-biodiversity country. However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia’s forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia’s remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia’s forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Although an experienced pedologist quickly identifies soils with a cohesive character (similar to hardsetting soils) directly in the field, advances in its correct diagnosis are needed, since the description requires wet and dry soil situations and relies upon qualitative aspects. Taxonomic systems usually consider metrics for other diagnostic attributes (clay fraction activity, abrupt textural change, etc.), but not for the cohesive character, although the latter is environmentally important and is referred to in soil taxonomy systems. Research is especially required at the microscale, where adhesive and cohesive forces are manifested as particle interactions. The aim of this study was to determine whether rheological properties obtained in amplitude sweep tests can serve as indicators of hardsetting or cohesive soils to improve the understanding of underlying processes in such soils. We analyzed soil samples from horizons identified as either cohesive or non-cohesive from six Brazilian soils (Typic Paleudalf, Ultic Hapludalf, Typic Hapludalf, Typic Paleustult, Kandiudox and Hapludox), separated by depth in top, middle and bottom layers. As rheological properties we determined: strain at the end of the linear viscoelastic range (LVR) (γLVR), shear stress at the end of the LVR (τLVR), strain at the yield point (YP) (γYP), storage and loss modulus at the YP (G′G″YP), maximum shear stress (τmax), strain at the maximum shear stress (γ τ max), and integral z (Iz). Cohesion only affected γLVR in the base position, and had a significant effect on τmax and γ τ max in the top and middle positions, respectively. Three soil materials did not reach the yield point. The Iz was either higher or lower in cohesive soils compared to non-cohesive soils. Where the Iz was higher in non-cohesive soils, this seems to be linked to a small dilatancy as a consequence of the high friction between soil particles. Also, τmax and Iz showed significant interactions of soil type and cohesion by means of a two-way ANOVA. Soil type had a greater effect on rheological properties, and the Typic Paleudalf had generally higher values. Parallely determined iron, organic carbon and clay contents, bulk density and normal force at the beginning of the test had the greatest impact on rheology. Tensile strength, a property evaluated on the mesoscale, had the closest relationship with γτ max and τmax. In conclusion, rheometry can support common analyses to identify the cohesive character, however, for an independent evaluation based upon most sensitive rheological attributes, further testing is needed, with a greater diversity of soils and at different water contents. The possibility to promptly identify cohesive character by quantitative means is essential for effective measures for the mitigation of the mechanical impediments of cohesive soils for agriculture. With the existence of a single parameter to distinguish cohesiveness and its magnitude, different soil management strategies can be easily tested and compared to obtain greater soil workability and, therefore, improved fertility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soils have many ecological functions and provide various ecosystem services including support for global food and fuel production. However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet’s arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

AB  - Development cooperation in agriculture aims to contribute to the achieving of a large part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN 2030 Agenda, especially the first three, No Poverty (1), Zero Hunger (2), and Good Health and Well-being (3). Development cooperation in agriculture tries to help local communities to increase their awareness, participation, and skills about the management of land and environmental resources, in order to realize sustainable development. In this context, methods of participatory assessment of land suitability have been widely and successfully applied. The present research took place in the framework of a real development cooperation intervention in Nord Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo) and aimed to implement a rapid participatory assessment of land suitability. In this context, where official and detailed data are not available, the study fostered the active involvement of local experts and used geographical information systems (GIS) to identify the most suitable crops to be supported in different zones of the study area. Toward this aim, the authors used a procedure based on the following steps: the identification of relevant land use types (LUTs), mapping capability factors, describing the responses of each LUT to the different capability factors, mapping potential land suitability for the LUTs, mapping accessibility, mapping land suitability for the LUTs. Resulting maps and tables were used to identify the most suitable areas for the different uses. Globally, forestry was the most suited use (99.6% of the study area is potentially highly suitable), followed by the cropping of manioc, sorghum, banana, oil palm, bean and cattle grazing in decreasing order (62.6% of the study area is potentially highly suitable for grazing). When accessibility is considered, forestry presents the largest decrease in the class of high potential suitability (−34.9% equal to a loss of 24,945.5 ha), while less adaptable uses, such as cattle grazing showed lower decreases in highly suitable class (−11.2%) and larger increases in scarcely suitable class (+9.5%). At a later stage, the comparison between computed suitability and actual land use helped with identifying the areas where forestry should be the only (or most) supported activity and the areas where to push integrated land uses. Our interpretation of the results allows us to recommend the adoption of agroforestry and intercropping as the main methodologies to integrate multiple aims such as the environmental conservation and the improvement of livelihoods. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Deforestation fires are hindering climate change mitigation efforts and compounding global environmental challenges. Indonesia and Brazil have experienced high rates of deforestation fires in recent years, with many of the fires burning in peatland-rich ecosystems. We quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 2019 and 2020 deforestation fires in both countries and determine the share of emissions originating from peatlands. Specifically, we use publicly available data for deforested area estimates and quantify the above-ground biomass (AGB), dry matter, and peat soil emissions associated with these fires. We find that the cumulative emissions impact from deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil was 3.7 (±0.4) and 1.9 (±0.2) Gt CO2eq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Nearly half of this GHG impact can be attributed to emissions from peatlands. However, real-time monitoring tools can underestimate these emissions as fires in peatlands smolder underground and can go undetected by satellites. We compare our results with publicly available land-use and fire emissions data and find that the magnitude of underestimation is of the order of 200–300% for severe fire years and highest in the peatland-rich Brazilian Pantanal. We identify the gaps in current policies that are exacerbating the GHG and climate impacts of deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil and emphasize the need for regular pre- and post-fire ground measurement, transparent data sharing, and robust policy enforcement for effective forest and peatland protection.

AB  - The potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for atmospheric carbon sequestration in degraded tropical lands is of key interest for climate change and rural development policies. This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0–20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 ± 2.0 and 47.2 ± 8.1 Mg ha−1, respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 ± 2.5 and 26.5 ± 19.5 Mg ha−1). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 ± 11.0 Mg ha−1), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 ± 5.1 Mg ha−1) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 ± 7.5 Mg ha−1). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (± 16) in AFS and 35% (± 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Coastal City of Banda Aceh has experienced considerable changes related to urban morphology, and also the environmental and climatic aspects, particularly after a massive earthquake hit the City on 26th December 2004. The city’s climate is basically characterized by high air temperature and relative humidity. However, climatic data of 1995-2015 shows that its temperature has actually increased. The issue worsens the thermal comfort, lead to more energy used for cooling, and can even induce heat-stress-related health problems. Urban heat island effect is one potential cause, triggered by significant progress of infrastructure development, increased number of vehicles, and land-use changes. It argues that sustainable urban landscaping is a prerequisite to environmental sustainability, especially in coastal city that prone of disasters. This study composes and analyzes the potential of vegetative measures for mitigating the issue. To provide reflective solutions, both substantial vegetative cooling mechanisms are studied. Hence, the paper asserted that unsustainable use of urban landscape structures leads to environmental problems, such as biodiversity loss, climate change, and soil erosion. The outputs become the foundation for the strategic framework of the proposed vegetative measures, i.e. tree planting, development of greenspaces with optimum size, cover composition and distribution, and green façade application to support sustainable landscapes. The impact of each vegetative intervention is investigated through microclimate simulations run using ENVI-met. Air temperature and other climatic factors related to outdoor thermal comfort and urban heat island are used as the indicators. The results reveal that landscaping such: tree planting with proper distance, adjusted based on tree canopy’s width to optimize shading, improves outdoor thermal comfort considerably, while the impact on urban heat island is rather small. On the other hand, green facade application only impacts insignificantly on both aspects. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - The performance of private forest governance systems, such as the standard and approach developed by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), is often assessed at the local level although they also have an indirect influence on public policies at the national level. Such spillover effects must be understood to assess the effectiveness of certification in contributing to improved forest governance. With this purpose, this article analyses the influences of the implementation of FSC standards on changes in forest governance in Cameroon, Congo and Gabon based on perceptions of 43 “knowledgeable” actors of FSC natural forest management. The information was collected through the use of semi-open and open interviews, and rankings. Findings show that perceived FSC influence on forest governance has followed two pathways: (a) a clear impact on stakeholder participation and timber traceability; and (b) a limited impact on improving national governance, as illustrated by the lack of global improvement in resource management practices or in biodiversity conservation. Moreover, interviewees agreed that struggles against corruption and transparency have not been impacted by the FSC certification in the Congo Basin. This mitigated influence of FSC on forest governance is first explained by a limited spillover effect of the virtuous practices of the seven FSC-certified companies on the national logging sector. Secondly, progress in FSC certification has been little taken up by public policies, which remain the main leverage for action on forest governance in producing countries. © 2021 United Nations.

AB  - The number of smallholders' farmer around the forest areas in Indonesia are about fifteen million households, and facing the risk of climate change disaster in their activities on the various national park area in Indonesia. This paper discussed about the role of management decentralization of National Park Zonation toward enhancement livelihood adaptation strategy of smallholder farmers, facing the risk of climate change disaster using spatial analysis (GIS) and content analysis. The result describing proprietor's devolution at the resort level in the management of special zone and traditional zone that is a basic strategy to provide access to smallholders manages the land to develop agroforestry patterns that are resistant to climate variability. While in the jungle zone and utilization zone, devolution is only authorized user rights until the claimant right to collect non-timber forest products grown naturally to ensure resource sustainability. Pseudo de-concentration by the SPTN is required to monitor and ensure proprietors devolution rights, authorized user right, or claimant right in the management of traditional zone, special zone, jungle zone, and utilization zone between resort institution, the village head, and smallholders' farmers. The implementation of devolution that produces anonymous adaptation supported by planned adaptation from village institutions and government can enhancement the adaptation capacity of smallholder farmers in managing rice fields and their PLKCS land or in conservation forest areas with the availability of irrigation water sources. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article canvasses the current definitions and framings of “agroforestry” in different academic literature and policies. Three key framings of “agroforestry” are identified in the scholarship and explored for their differences. The findings suggest that the distinct schools of research on “agroforestry” focus on distinct points of departure, and these baseline situations from which transitions to what is called “agroforestry” occur vary in distinct ways from monoculture plantations to primary forests. Political-economic analysis is used to scrutinize three key “agroforestry” transition categories: agroecological, agribusiness, and forest degradation, which the article identifies as agroecoforestry (the good), agrobizforestry (the bad), and agrodeforestry (the ugly) transitions, respectively. Examples of each type are provided based on field research in Brazil, and the results are put into a global perspective. The categories are helpful in identifying the “agroforestry” transitions that are currently marketed as good solutions but might also have negative impacts and in highlighting the agroecological agroforestry transitions that would help simultaneously increase global food production, adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis, and achieve equity and social justice. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Integrated farming systems are promising strategies towards land-use efficiency and sustainable agriculture. The integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) system stablish complex interactions were synergies or competition depend on the arrangements throughout time and space. Fine root (≤2 mm) growth dynamics of crops, pasture and trees remains unclear when these species are integrated. We aimed to assess root growth dynamics after Eucalyptus urograndis introduction into an integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system. Previous ICL area was used as a reference. We assessed ICLF 1.9, 4.3 and 7.5 m distances from tree rows, starting the study when trees had three years of age. Eucalyptus rows were spaced 15 m apart and integrated to annual crops and pasture. We evaluated the root growth under two different successional periods: (i) corn cultivation interspaced with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha); and (ii) a pasture, when palisade grass was grazed. We tracked fine root length using the minirhizotron technique, capturing 3200 images scanning up to 70 cm soil depth. Data of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission, soil bulk density, rainfall and air temperature were used as complementary information to support the discussion. Our results showed that Eucalyptus trees impaired root growth of annual crops cultivated in the interrow position, regardless of distance from the row. From 31 to 80 days after corn germination, root length production in ICLF was reduced by 120–179 cm m−2.d−1 along the tree interrow space. For the pasture period, total produced root length density reduced 6% at 1.9 m but increased 25% at 4.3 and 7.5 m, when compared to ICL. Shade of Eucalyptus trees at ICLF 1.9 m position, with PAR transmission mainly below 60%, sharply impaired root growth. Eucalyptus roots represented 12% from total root length produced in ICLF system, and 38% of these roots had positive ectomycorrhizal status. In conclusion, under Eucalyptus trees higher than 20 m, pasture of palisade grass is more adaptable than corn when considering the root growth dynamics of our studied ICLF arrangement. Based on our findings, corn intercropped with palisade grass should not be introduced in future management of the ICLF system, unless part of the trees is chopped to reduce light competition. However, implemented pasture of palisade grass showed belowground synergies with Eucalyptus, increasing root growth in intermediary interrow positions and emerging new fungal symbiosis, which could be playing important functions in soil, as soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Droughts have increased in frequency, duration, and severity across most of the tropics but their effect on forest communities remain not fully understood. Here we assessed the effects of a severe El Niño-induced drought event on dominant and low abundance understory plant species and the consequent impacts on ecosystem functions in the South American Atlantic Forest. We established 20 permanent plots with contrasting vegetation structure and topography. In each plot, we measured the stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of every understory woody plant (i.e. 1 to 10 cm stem diameter) before and after a severe 4-year drought event to calculate relative growth and mortality rates after drought. Litter biomass, litter nutrient content and soil nutrients, as well as tree canopy cover, were also quantified. High stem density reduced survival to drought for both dominant and low abundance understory woody species. The growth rate of dominant and low abundance species was lower on steeper slopes during the drought. Dominant species were the main contributor of litter biomass production whereas low abundance species were important drivers of litter quality. Overall, our findings suggest that habitats with low tree density and larger trees on flat areas, such as in valleys, can act as refuges for understory plant species during drought periods. These habitats are resource-rich, providing nutrients and water during unfavorable drought periods and might improve forest resilience to climate change in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear. Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Três Marias basin (50.600 km²) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992–2005) and evaluated (2006–2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossil-based economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015–2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %–15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %–15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow. Riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed, as expected by many PES. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The emission of CO2 from the soil in agricultural areas is the result of the interaction of several factors, including soil and crop management practices and local edaphoclimatic conditions. The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas, can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability, quality, or decomposition capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating CO2 emissions. The study was carried out in the municipality of Selvíria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing, subsidized by the forage plant Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas, and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The results indicated that soil management practices, followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with U. brizantha, increased the total OC (TOC) stocks through the stable fraction (OC associated with the mineral fraction) and consequent reduction in CO2 emissions from the soil. This highlights the spatial variability in CO2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere. The use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast CO2 emissions from the soil. This small-scale study provides a theoretical basis for the large-scale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control CO2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems, particularly in degraded pasture areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The positive phenomenon of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD +) in 2019 caused an extreme dry season in parts of Indonesia, including in the province of South Sumatera. This caused massive fires on peatlands in South Sumatera. The Government of Indonesia through the Agency for Peat Restoration (BRG) has deployed an integrated equipment system to measure in situ several fire control parameters on several peatlands, including in South Sumatera. The aim is to predict and mitigate fire incidents on peatlands. One of the measured parameters is soil moisture. This study has examined the impact of the extreme dry season on the rate of decline in soil moisture at four BRG measurement stations, namely: Cinta jaya-1, Cinta Jaya-2, Padang Sugihan-3, and Karang Agung. The rate of decrease in soil moisture (% per day) obtained were: 0.06, 0.31, 0.38, 0.47 respectively for the stations Cinta jaya-1, Cinta Jaya-2, Padang Sugihan-3, and Karang Agung.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km2 of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 ± 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 . Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia’s emission reduction target by 2030. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is a serious global threat to be addressed by rapid reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Subsequent to the 1997 Kyoto protocol, there was a consensus among environmental and natural scientists that increasing green cover is the only realistic way to reduce carbon dioxide emission due to anthropogenic interferences. Reduction of emission through deforestation and degradation (REDD) emerged as a prime agenda to be adopted through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In 2007, the UNFCCC COP 13 held at Bali, Indonesia appreciated the conservation strategies of developing countries like India, China, Thailand, etc., and recommended adding Enhanced Carbon storage and came up with the concept of REDD+. In its unique conservation efforts to protect the forests, India strengthened its legal framework and has also undertaken several field conservation measures. It has shown an increase in the forest cover despite massive human and cattle population. It is imperative to measure the carbon stock (both biomass and soil carbon) in the forest in order to estimate the enhanced carbon stock. The enhanced carbon stock in the forest is helpful in compensating the emission reduction activities of India as envisaged in INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution). Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu (Javadi hill) in India are taken in the present study and the status of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classification are taken up for analysis using sampling techniques and Geospatial technology. The LANDSAT data was analyzed to assess the NDVI and the soil samples were analyzed to estimate the SOC using CN analyzer. All the gridded point samplings were interpolated spatially by Kriging tools. The variations in the NDVI and SOC are spatially estimated for the whole area and the low SOC coupled with low green cover are identified, and precise forest degradation was estimated in the study. As per the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 15, reversal of land degradation and eco-restoration are prime components to be addressed with adequate eco-restoration works in conjunction with the agenda of INDC. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.

AB  - The increasing carbon emission caused by human and industrial activity has a destructive impact on earth. Agroforestry as one of model in forest management has played an essential role in carbon sequestration through vegetation growth. Information about the potency of biomass is important to evaluate carbon stock in the forest. The study was conducted to determine the potential of stored biomass and carbon stocks managed by the Dusung of agroforestry Toisapu Negeri Hutumuri, Sirimau Protected Forest in Ambon.The study was conducted using nondestructive method in three main plots (PU) for observing vegetation at the level of poles, trees, understorey, litter, and dead organics. Observation parameters include plant biomass stocks and carbon stocks potency.

AB  - Brazil has a high diversity of primates, but increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change could influence forest cover in the country and cause future changes in the distribution of primate populations. Here we aim to assess the long-term suitability of habitats for the conservation of three threatened Brazilian primates (Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus flavius and Sapajus libidinosus) through (1) estimating their current and future distributions using species distribution models, (2) evaluating how much of the areas projected to be suitable is represented within protected areas and priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and (3) assessing the extent of remaining forest cover in areas predicted to be suitable for these species. We found that 88% of the suitable areas are outside protected areas and only 24% are located in areas with forest cover. Although not within protected areas, 27% of the climatically suitable areas are considered priority areas for conservation. Future projections, considering a severe climate change scenario, indicate that A. belzebul, S. flavius and S. libidinosus may lose up to 94, 98 and 54% of their suitable range, respectively. The establishment of primate populations and their long-term survival in these areas are at risk. Mitigation actions such as the implementation of new protected areas, forest restoration and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be essential for the conservation of Brazilian primates.

AB  - Luetzelburgia auriculata is used in the reforestation of degraded areas in Brazil due to its adaptation to the conditions of the country’s semiarid region. However, saline stress is one of the main abiotic factors with a negative impact on plant development. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the mass of Luetzelburguia auriculata seeds on tolerance to saline stress. The experiment was conducted with a completely randomized design in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme with two classes of seeds [light (< 0.35 g) and heavy (≥ 0.35 g)], from ten morphologically similar mother plants that showed natural variation in seed mass, and five salinity levels, distributed in four replicates of 25 seeds. We evaluated the following variables: germination rate; germination speed index; mean germination time; initial seedling growth; and fresh and dry mass of the shoots, cotyledons and roots. The data were submitted to analysis of variance. Means for seed classes were compared using the F-test and regression analysis was performed for NaCl levels. The increase in saline stress led to reductions in germination, root length, fresh and dry mass of the shoots, and the GSI, as well as a delay in MGT. Seedlings from heavy seeds (≥ 0.35 g) exhibited greater tolerance to salt stress than those from light seeds (< 0.35 g), due to lower occlusion caused by NaCl levels. Thus, heavy seeds of L. auriculata are more tolerant to salt stress and should be prioritized, especially in the presence of high salinity levels. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as cost-effective, high-resolution alternatives to satellites for the environmental monitoring of large areas. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using UAV-acquired soil surface temperature to monitor groundwater level in a peatland undergoing groundwater restoration to mitigate fire risk (Tanjung Leban, Indonesia). We used two UAVs (Inspire 1, with an infrared camera, and Phantom 4) to map soil surface temperatures at 459 points on bare land. Using a spline analysis of groundwater-level and elevation data in Arc GIS 10.6, we produced ground elevation and groundwater table maps and measured the groundwater level (depth from the ground surface) at each bare-land point. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis determined a negative correlation between the soil surface temperature and groundwater level. Our study shows that soil surface temperature is a reliable proxy for groundwater level in tropical peatlands. This proxy can be monitored cost-effectively using UAVs equipped with infrared cameras. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon. Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (CT) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and CT values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y—this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study, tweets related to fires in Riau, Sumatra, were identified using carefully selected keywords for the 2014–2019 timeframe. The TAGGS algorithm was applied, which allows for geoparsing based on the user’s nationality and hometown and on direct referrals to specific locations such as name of province or name of city in the message itself. Online newspapers covering Riau were analyzed for the year 2019 to provide additional information about the reasons why fires occurred and other factors, such as impact on people’s health, animal mortality related to ecosystem disruption, visibility, decrease in air quality and limitations in the government firefighting response. Correlation analysis between meteorological information, Twitter activity and satellite-derived hotspots was conducted. The existing approaches that BMKG and other Indonesian agencies use to detect fire activity are reviewed and a novel approach for early fire detection is proposed based on the crowdsourcing of tweets. The policy implications of these results suggest that crowdsourced data can be included in the fire management system in Indonesia to support early fire detection and fire disaster mitigation efforts. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34–98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1 on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. Highlights: On-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Many countries have implemented national climate policies to accomplish pledged Nationally Determined Contributions and to contribute to the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2023, the global stocktake will assess the combined effort of countries. Here, based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, we show that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 GtCO2eq by 2030 with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2 °C and 1.5 °C Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions would be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. Interestingly, the countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 °C. This shows that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Many activities related to the expansion of food supply, energy and infrastructure result in great environmental impacts, whose most visible features are observed in the degradation of large areas. The present study demonstrates how the combined use of stonemeal technology and agroforestry systems can help to reverse such impacts, allying the recovery of degraded areas with agricultural and forest production. The study area is located in a hydroelectric reservoir affected by the siltation process and soil erosion in the hydrographic basin of the San Francisco River, Brazil. An Experimental Unit (EU) was set up in the Ecological Station of Pirapitinga (Três Marias reservoir). The design of the EU was based on a factorial design, with seven treatments applied on six native tree species, with three replications (21 blocks). The germination and establishment data of each species were considered in the different treatments. The oxides concentration and fertility level of sediments were analyzed for the determination of the sampling points in the reservoir. The experiment and evaluation were conducted over six years, and the sediments analysis presented high levels of the essential macronutrients K2O, MgO and TiO2, while CaO and Na2O levels were significantly low, due to their high solubility and mobility. The P2O5 also showed equally low values. After two years, soil pH was balanced, especially in the blocks with mineral inputs. P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations were increased up to 5 times more than those of original soil of the EU, and the highest values were found in the remineralizer + sediment treatment. The use of geological material (e.g. mining waste) and organic compost was proved to be an adequate and sustainable technology to mitigate degradation processes. Besides, locally available sources of organic matter enhanced. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bees are typically diurnal but around 1% of described species have nocturnal activity. Nocturnal bees are still poorly studied due to bias towards studying diurnal insects. However, knowledge concerning their biology and role as crop pollinators has increased. We review the literature on nocturnal bees’ traits and their host plants, and assess the crop pollination effectiveness of this neglected group. Nocturnal bees have visual adaptations to cope with low light intensities, and floral scents are a key sensory cue used to find their host flowers. Nocturnal bees generally show high flower constancy, the ability to vibrate flowers, and high transfer rates of pollen grains to stigmas. The flowers visited by nocturnal bees range from small radial and zygomorphic flowers to large brush blossoms; moreover, they visit plants with different flowering strategies. Nocturnal bees are effective pollinators of regional fruit crops in Brazil, such as cambuci (Campomanesia phaea), guaraná (Paullinia cupana), cajá (Spondias mombin), and in North America of cultivated pumpkins (Cucurbita species). However, they most likely are pollinators of several other crops. Strategies to host high numbers of nocturnal bees around cropping areas should be taken, such as preserving adjacent native forests, restricting soil management, providing food resources beyond crop flowers, and avoiding light pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Land use change in the Bangsri sub-catchment of the Brantas basin in East Java during the past three decades has increased both local and global climate vulnerability, by degrading soils and contributing to net greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Our study aimed to estimate land use change and its impact on net carbon emissions, as well as to formulate strategies for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change downstream of a National park. We analyzed land cover changes from satellite imagery and measured carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil (0 to 30 cm) pools. Satellite imagery of land cover in 1994, 2001, 2011 and 2017 showed a decrease in natural forest area and an increase in the area of shrubs, agroforestry, production forests and annual crop land. Net CO2 emission increased from 2.4 to 6.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Sand mining is the most destructive land use pattern in the area, as it leaves soil profiles stripped of their topsoil. Vulnerability to less reliable rainfall has been addressed by the common creation of small reservoirs and the abundant use of irrigation for vegetables growing under partial shade in the agroforestry zone. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Small-scale anaerobic digestion of wet organic wastes can make positive contributions to climate mitigation, energy security and nutrient cycling in agri-food systems. However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m3) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 ± 37 741 m3 of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile “BioMiniGen” system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 ± 449 MWh yr−1 bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 ± 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management. BioMiniGen technology could make an important contribution to energy security for the 1.4 billion people globally who lack access to electricity. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Ensuring a sufficient and adequate supply of water for humans and ecosystems is a pressing environmental challenge. The expansion of agricultural and urban lands has jeopardized watershed ecosystem services and a changing climate poses additional risks for regional water supply. We used stream water quality data collected between 2000 and 2014, coupled with detailed precipitation and land cover information, to investigate the effects of landscape composition and short-term precipitation variability on the quality of water resources in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The state is home to over 45 million people and has a long history of human landscape modification. A severe drought in 2014–2015 led to a major water crisis and highlighted the fragility of the regional water supply system. We found that human-dominated watersheds had lower overall water quality when compared to forested watersheds, with urban cover showing the most detrimental impacts on water quality. Forest cover was associated with a better overall water quality across the studied watersheds, with forested watersheds having low turbidity and high dissolved oxygen. High precipitation led to increased turbidity and fecal coliforms levels and lower dissolved oxygen in streams but these effects depended on watershed land cover. High precipitation diluted concentrations of nitrogen and dissolved solids in highly urbanized watersheds but exacerbated turbidity in pasture-dominated watersheds. Given the high costs of water treatment in densely populated regions, there is a pressing need to plan and manage landscapes in order to ensure adequate water resources. In tropical regions, maintaining or restoring native vegetation cover is a promising intervention to sustain adequate water quality. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Ecological restoration is a tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and yet its outcomes are susceptible themselves to climate change impacts. Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions – Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN – revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a “future-proofing” approach to restoration success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021–2030 through more climate resilient restoration. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Meeting Brazil’s ambitious national commitments on both climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation depends on securing its reserves of forest carbon and biodiversity. Brazil’s ‘Forest Code’ is a key tool to reconcile environmental preservation and agricultural production; it limits deforestation and requires forest restoration in illegally deforested areas. However, not all provisions of the law’s 2012 revision have yet been implemented and some are facing new challenges. Using modelled land use change projections for the whole of the country, we show that full implementation and enforcement of the law has the potential to contribute to conserving biodiversity. Biodiversity outcomes will be especially positive if (i) deforested areas are restored in ways that support recolonization by native species and (ii) additional measures are implemented to protect native vegetation in areas like Caatinga dry forests and Cerrado savannas, which may experience added pressure displaced from other regions by Forest Code implementation. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Demand for land has increased very rapidly in line with population development and economic growth. In an effort to achieve high economic growth, land productivity is spurred in such a way as to result in the increased exploitation of natural resources which has an impact on the destruction of forests, land, water, air, and biodiversity. The concept of sustainable use of natural resources will face various challenges because, on the one hand, increased economic resilience must be encouraged, while on the other hand, ecological aspects and physical preservation of the landscape must be maintained. The study was aimed at finding out the historical basis of forest land-use change and recommendations for sustainable land use models based on the economic and ecological adaptation of farmers around the buffer zone of Lore Lindu National Park (TNLL), Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This type of research is qualitative research to describe the history of land-use change and ecological adaptation. Meanwhile, economic risk analysis is used to explain the economic adaptation of farmers. The results showed that land use with agroforestry systems was the result of the economic and ecological adaptation of farmers based on the economic and climate change risks faced by farmers around forests. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Eugenia involucrata DC. is a forest species with high environmental and economic potential. The objective of this study was to quantify the genetic variability and analyzed the genetic structure of three natural fragments located in the central region of the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We used four microsatellite loci developed for the congener species Eugenia uniflora and using GenAlEx 6.5 software, parameters of genetic variability and its partition among and within fragments were estimated for each locus. We observed high levels of genetic variability (3.67 alleles per locus; HO = 0.815; HE = 0.625; FIS = −0.294), most of which (93%) were distributed within the fragments, suggesting that these individuals came from a single original population. Gene flow between fragments was high (2.35 to 4.56 migrants per generation), resulting in low genetic differentiation indexes (FST values ranging from 0.052 to 0.096). The fragments showed high genetic variability, distributed within the remnants themselves, and low genetic differentiation. Our results have repercussions for planning locally adapted germplasm collections for forest restoration programs, thereby avoiding the implantation of populations with an exogamous depression. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of aboveground biomass (AGB) variation in present-day tropical forests can contribute to management strategies that help mitigate against CO2-driven climate change and provide other services related to high AGB. Higher tree diversity can lead to higher woody productivity and carbon storage, but how diversity interacts with land-use history is less certain. We assessed variation in AGB across forests with different land-use histories and surrounding landscapes in southeastern Brazil and how AGB relates to tree diversity per se, while controlling for important factors such as mean functional trait values, stem density and soil fertility. Our findings indicate that aboveground biomass of forests is dependent on land-use history and the landscape matrix in which they occur (urban or non-urban). We found that tree diversity, measured as the average evolutionary divergence among close relatives, shows a strong positive relationship to AGB, but only in old-growth, non-urban forests. This suggests that higher niche complementarity leads to higher AGB in certain ecological contexts. Forests in an urban matrix, and those that regenerated from cropland (in an urban or non-urban matrix), showed weak or insignificant relationships between AGB and diversity, and forests that regenerated from completely denuded landscapes, including soil removal, actually showed a negative relationship between diversity and AGB. Meanwhile, across all forest classes, the abundance-weighted mean wood density of tree species present showed a consistent positive correlation with AGB, indicating the ubiquity of mass-ratio effects on AGB. Overall, our study suggests that strategies for conservation and restoration should account for past land-use and the matrix where forests are inserted, as the distribution of carbon stocks and biodiversity may need to be considered separately. © 2021

AB  - Biodiversity-friendly agricultural systems allow the maintenance of native species even in highly fragmented landscapes by providing corridors to species dispersion and offering supplementary resources for animal populations. In the tropical region, cocoa agroforestry systems are of great importance for biodiversity conservation as they maintain part of the native vegetation, and therefore can be used by the local fauna. In this system, understory of native forests is replaced by cocoa trees, which are shaded by large old-growth trees. However, the persistence of native species in cocoa agroforests depends on local vegetation characteristics but also the landscape structure in which these systems are located. Here, we investigated the influence of landscape composition (i.e. amount of forest cover, cocoa agroforestry and cattle pasture) and local vegetation structure (i.e. number of native and cocoa trees, basal area of native trees and canopy closure) on understory birds in 18 cocoa agroforestry systems located in three regions in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, presenting distinct land use contexts. Specifically, we assessed the effects of these landscape and local features in predicting richness and abundance patterns of the entire community, and also in distinct ecological groups, such as forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent birds, and insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. Using generalized linear models and Akaike information criterion, we observed lower species richness of complete community, non-forest and omnivorous birds in the most deforested region. Also, our findings demonstrated that cocoa agroforests integrated in more forested landscapes harbor greater richness and abundance of frugivorous birds. Conversely, the increase in cattle pasture amount at the landscape had a harsh effect on all bird groups evaluated. Regarding local vegetation, we observed that the increase of canopy closure leads to greater abundance of insectivorous birds in cocoa agroforestry systems. Similarly, abundance of non-forest species increased in agroforests with higher number of cocoa trees. Our study demonstrated that cocoa agroforestry systems can provide complementary habitats for many species, including forest birds, and therefore can mitigate the effects of habitat loss. However, this key benefit for bird conservation will be more effective when these agroforestry systems are located in more forested landscapes, with low amount of cattle pastures. Our findings therefore reinforce the alarming need to maintain and recover landscape-scale forest amount to ensure species persistence of birds in anthropogenic landscapes, even in those comprising biodiversity-friendly land uses such as cocoa agroforestry systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i.e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three- (SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha−1). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biochar is a product rich in carbon, which improve the soil attributes and crop yield. In the Brazilian tropical dry region, common bean is cultivated under rainfed, in poor, acidic, and with low water retention soils. This work aims to evaluate the effect of biochar on soil physical and chemical attributes, on evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), and on bean yield. The field experiment was conducted over four biochar rates (B0: no biochar; B10: biochar at 10 t ha−1; B20: 20 t ha−1 and B40: 40 t ha−1), and three replications. Our analysis revealed that different rates of biochar do not affect the soil physical attributes due to a mismatch between soil texture and the particle size of biochar. Treatments with biochar promoted an increase in soil pH, P content, cation exchange capacity, reduced the Al+H content, which caused an increase in bean yield and consequently WUE. Our findings expand our knowledge about the effect of the biochar applied to the Acrisols on decreasing the soil acidity and to increase the yield and WUE, and add important information that can be suitable for development of strategy to mitigate problems caused by instability of rains and poor fertility soils. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Drought periods may change mangrove litterfall production through water deprivation and increasing tree evapotranspiration, but these impacts have been rarely estimated. In Brazil, an intense drought and strong winds impacted mangrove forests leading to mass tree mortality in 2016, suggesting that forest productivity also declined rapidly. Fifteen months after the initial impact, we started to monitor and quantify litterfall production in paired transects from disturbed and undisturbed mangroves. The litterfall production of the undisturbed forests (575 ± 28 Kg C ha−1 y−1) was 31- to 3-fold higher than that at the disturbed mangrove forests (18 to 169 Kg C ha−1 y−1). The strong decline in litterfall production may have implications to the export of nutrients to estuarine ecosystems. Our baseline suggests that mangrove forests are greatly vulnerable to climate impacts and that the litterfall production collapse in dead mangrove forests may impair marine ecosystem food webs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The expansion of blackberry cropping in subtropical regions is recent, requiring adaptability studies and the development of new cultivars, as well as suitable plant management. Aiming to study adaptability and agronomic performance of blackberry (Rubus spp.) under drastic summer pruning in a subtropical region, the response of four blackberry cultivars (‘BRS Tupy’, ‘Guarani’, ‘Brazos’ and ‘Choctaw’) to N and K fertilization was evaluated during two growing seasons in Jundiaí (Brazil). The experiment used split-plots in a randomized complete block design with four replicates. The plots consisted of combinations of three N rates (75, 150 and 300 kg·ha–1·year–1) and three K rates (50, 100 and 200 kg·ha–1·year–1 of K2 O) in factorial arrangement and an additional control treatment without fertilizer application. In the subplots, four cultivars of blackberry were studied. Considering fruit yield, accumulation of phytomass and mineral elements, as well as the nutrient efficiency use, the cultivars that showed greater adaptation to cultivation in a subtropical area under drastic summer pruning management are ‘Brazos’, ‘Guarani’, ‘BRS Tupy’ and ‘Choctaw’, in that order. An annual application of 120 and 67 kg·ha–1 of N and K2 O, respectively, is expected to be sufficient to achieve maximum economic yield. © 2021, Agronomic Institute of Campinas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Necromass is crucial to understanding both carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the forest. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock and spatial distribution of necromass components in an Atlantic rainforest, southern Brazil, one hotspot of biodiversity. Necromass comprised: standing dead trees and stumps (SWN), large-sized woody necromass (LWN), medium-sized woody necromass (MWN), and litter (LTR). Specific sample designs assessed each component, while the Payandeh index indicated spatial distribution. Mean wood densities of LWN ranged from 0.24 to 0.46 g.cm−3, and mean carbon fraction ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 gC.g−1 d.m. depending on decay class. The total necromass carbon stock was 12.83 MgC.ha−1. SWN, LWN, MWN, and LTR carbon stores were 3.15, 4.24, 1.50, and 3.53 MgC.ha−1, respectively. LWN and MWN showed a reverse J-curve skewed carbon stock distribution and clumped spatial pattern. LTR presented asymmetric distribution and a random spatial pattern. Coarse and heavy necromass is clumped near dead trees, while the wind scatters fine necromass throughout the forest. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon cycle in Atlantic rainforests and may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and the Global Forest Resource Assessment. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - We assessed the influence of the intertidal and salinity gradients and mangrove forest structure on C stocks and sequestration rates in mangrove soils of an estuarine system in Todos os Santos Bay, Eastern Brazil. The accumulation rates of organic C (Corg) during the last century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to 1073 g Corg m−2 yr−1. The mean stocks of Corg and N for the top 1 m soils were 263 ± 14 Mg Corg ha−1 and 11.8 ± 0.4 Mg N ha−1, respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on Corg and N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs of mangroves (~ 10%) on the planet, has 207 ± 34 Tg Corg in the upper meter of soils, which represents 3–8% of the C stored in mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2 emissions. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography

AB  - Challenges in reclaiming tin-mined soil in Bangka Island, Indonesia are the declining quality of soil properties, metal and heavy metal contamination, and increasing acidity. A recent evaluation found leaf and root anatomical traits of species in ex tin mined soils were not correlated with survival rates, height growth or canopy areas. Thus, a renewed study focusing more on the functional traits to confirm morphological performance in the field is needed. Combining the study of leaf and root functional traits with the other physical trait studies may streamline the determination of species selection criteria for tin reclamation use. By studying samples of 92 plant species (24 herbs, 21 shrubs, 44 trees, and 3 lianas) grown in mined spoils and in forest fragments, focusing on 8 key functional traits, it is found that the leaf functional traits and root traits differed between plants grown in the ex-mined site and in the forest. Stomatal conductivities of several plant habits that grow on tin-mined soil were higher than those that grow on undisturbed land. Chlorophyll a of herbs and lianas and chlorophyll b in all habits, which were grown in ex-mined soils, were lower. Stomatal densities of herbs and lianas in-mined land were higher than plants grown in the forest. Leaf thickness, mesophyll and adaxial cuticle thickness of all habits grown in ex-mined spoils were higher than for plants grown in the forest. The enlarged palisade cells of those living in the dry ex-mined environment indicate their tolerance to water stress. In other study, the root conductivities in sedge and shrub species were higher in ex-mined soil compared to those grown in the undisturbed environments, while tree showed the opposite pattern. Some attributes are consistent with plants growing under greater water stress, therefore selection of species for regevetation should rely on those. The correlations of root and leaf traits are not consistent among herbs, shrubs, trees, and lianas and this might reflect different adaptive strategies. This inconsistency suggests that root conductivity, stomatal conductivity, and leaf nitrogen content in more species representing traits related to drought tolerance, regardless of growth habit, should be emphasized in the future studies. © 2021, Qualified Mining Consultants LLC,.All right reserved.

AB  - Mangrove microbiomes play an essential role in the fate of mangroves in our changing planet, but the factors regulating the biogeographical distribution of mangrove microbial communities remain essentially vague. This paper contributes to our understanding of mangrove microbiomes distributed along three biogeographical provinces and ecoregions, covering the exuberant mangroves of Amazonia ecoregion (North Brazil Shelf) as well as mangroves located in the southern limit of distribution (Southeastern ecoregion, Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic) and mangroves localized on the drier semi-arid coast (Northeastern ecoregion, Tropical Southwestern Atlantic), two important ecotones where poleward and landward shifts, respectively, are expected to occur related to climate change. This study compared the microbiomes associated with the conspicuous red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) root soils encompassing soil properties, latitudinal factors, and amplicon sequence variants of 105 samples. We demonstrated that, although the northern and southern sites are over 4,000 km apart, and despite R. mangle genetic divergences between north and south populations, their microbiomes resemble each other more than the northern and northeastern neighbors. In addition, the northeastern semi-arid microbiomes were more diverse and displayed a higher level of complexity than the northern and southern ones. This finding may reflect the endurance of the northeast microbial communities tailored to deal with the stressful conditions of semi-aridity and may play a role in the resistance and growing landward expansion observed in such mangroves. Minimum temperature, precipitation, organic carbon, and potential evapotranspiration were the main microbiota variation drivers and should be considered in mangrove conservation and recovery strategies in the Anthropocene. In the face of changes in climate, land cover, biodiversity, and chemical composition, the richness and complexity harbored by semi-arid mangrove microbiomes may hold the key to mangrove adaptability in our changing planet. © Copyright © 2021 Tavares, Bezerra, Normando, Rosado and Melo.

AB  - This study evaluates the benefits of mineral fertilizers replacement for biodigested vinasse. Data from experimental anaerobic digestion (AD) of vinasse were applied to support the analysis. Based on previous experiments, this assessment assumed that vinasse production could reach 2.38 × 107 m3/year generating around 66,585 MWh/year of electric energy from biogas burning in the Administrative Region of Campinas (ARC). This amount of energy could supply more than 103,000 inhabitants and avoid 35,892 tCO2eq/year (from electric energy replacement). The biodigested vinasse might also reduce the total N, P, and K mineral fertilizers demand per hectare of sugarcane crop in 30%, 1%, and 46%, respectively, avoiding additional greenhouse gas emissions of 111,877 tCO2eq/year. There is no biodigested vinasse surplus for a moderate fertigation rate of 100 m3/ha, complying with local environmental laws related to nutrients excess side effects in areas destined to sugarcane crop. Notwithstanding, a Geographic Information System analysis for a small adjacent area to ARC indicated nine different fertigation rates, ranging from 50 to 100 m3/ha. Even though the general analysis for ARC shows high NPK replacement levels, the fertigation practices should be subsidized for robust soil analysis and adequate to safe environmental levels. A management tool can be designed using the results here presented to subsidize investments for AD widespread adoption by the sugarcane industry to catch a reasonable practice from the economic and environmental perspectives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry (“jungle rubber”), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%–38% and 30%–40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Urban forests play an important role in the thermal comfort and overall life of local populations in large- and medium-sized cities. This study analyzes urban forest loss and maps land use and land cover (LULC) changes between 1991 and 2018 by evaluating the use of urban planning instruments for the mitigation of urban forest loss in João Pessoa, Brazil. For this purpose, satellite-derived LULC images from 1991, 2006, 2010 and 2018 and data on urban forest loss areas obtained using the Google Earth Engine were used. In addition, this paper also discusses the instruments used for integrated urban planning, which are (a) the legal sector, responsibility and nature; (b) the urban expansion process; and (c) the elements of urban infrastructure. The results show a clear shift in land use in the study area. The major changes in LULC classes occurred in urban areas and herbaceous vegetation, while the greatest loss was in arboreal/shrub vegetation. Thus, an increase in the pressure to occupy zones intended for environmental preservation could be estimated. Our results showed similar accuracies with other studies and more spatial details. The characteristics of the patterns, traces, and hotspots of urban expansion and forest cover loss were explored. We highlighted the potential use of this proposed framework to be applied and validated in other parts of the world to help better understand and quantify various aspects of urban-related problems such as urban forest loss mapping using instruments for integrated urban planning and low-cost approaches. © 2021, Science in China Press.

AB  - The management of water resources in medium and large cities has been changing in recent years, mainly as a result of climate change and the sharp increase of urbanization. In addition to the traditional solution of expansion of water supply, an approach that integrates technological alternatives of demand management in the infrastructure of urban constructions is proposed herein. However, these facilities are often more complex and expensive than conventional ones, being also challenging to achieve a balance between costs and benefits. While the environmental, social, and engineering benefits seem obvious, expressing them in monetary terms is usually a challenge that cost-effectiveness do not respond satisfactorily. Therefore, this research uses the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process multiple criteria method to rank three main alternatives (rainwater harvesting system, gray water recycling system, and water saving devices) that can be applied in low-income residences in Brazil. For this purpose, this paper considers criteria normally used in this type of analysis such as economic, technical, environmental and social criteria but also includes the local population acceptance and the evaluation of experts. The main results suggest that the most appropriate alternative is the use of water saving devices and that there is also a need for public policies that offer financial incentives to the population and prevent socioeconomic conditions from inhibiting the adoption of water conservation practices. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Productivity of coffee plantations is threatened by both climate change and decreasing revenues of coffee growers. Using shade trees might protect against temperature variability, erosion and excessive radiation but there may be trade-offs in productivity and quality. While impacts of shade trees on arabica (Coffea arabica) have been reviewed, a global synthesis on robusta (Coffea canephora) coffee is lacking. We assessed how shade affects robusta growth and productivity, and what are the interactions and trade-offs. We conducted a systematic literature search in Web of Science and CAB Abstracts on 16 December 2019. Thirty papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria of being experimental studies on the impact of overstory trees with approximately half being from Brazil or India. Shade improved robusta tree growth and yield with some contrasting effects on physicochemical and biochemical properties. Shade (> 30%) was associated with reduced beverage quality. Significant interactions between shade and location, rainfall level and robusta clone were found. Among the clones tested, 06V, C153, LB1, GG229 and JM2 showed a higher productivity and growth (from + 17 to + 280%) under moderate shade (41–65%). This is the first meta-analysis of the effects of shade on robusta coffee. By synthesizing data from different studies, we highlight for the first time that the effect of shade on robusta coffee depends on tree age. Shade had positive impacts on older robusta trees (mean of 16 years), while the impact of shade on younger trees was either insignificant or negative. We highlight the importance of both clone type and tree ages. Research gaps included a lack of knowledge on the effects of shade with respect to coffee and shade tree age as well as interactive effects. More in-depth studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of how shade trees affect robusta coffee. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Several studies indicate that the Amazon rainforest is home to the greatest biodiversity of tree species on the planet. The unique quality of this forest typology is under constant threat of change owing to the behavior of climate variables and different anthropic activities that occur in the biome itself. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies that clarify the factors that affect the formation of forests in this ecosystem and to validate the use of forest resources by society through appropriate forest management practices. Thus, this study aimed to answer how the structure, composition and floristic diversity of the forest are influenced by forest logging in different phases of development of a local Amazonian forest, and whether there is a relationship between these attributes and regional and global climate factors. This study assessed the dynamics of natural regeneration of 36 permanent plots over 33 years after logging in the Tapajós National Forest in Belterra, State of Pará, Brazil. The plots studied were measured in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, and 2012. All individuals with height greater than 30 cm and diameter at breast height <10 cm were monitored in three regeneration strata (seedlings, saplings, and small trees) and three forest classes (gap-phase forest, growing forest, and old-growth forest). Density, floristic similarity according to the Sørensen Index, and floristic diversity according to the Hill series were analyzed. Climate variables such as mean annual compensated temperature; total annual precipitation, and Oceanic Niño Index were correlated with the mortality, recruitment, and density of growing trees. An ANOVA for count data verified that the density of individuals differed over time since logging among the regeneration strata and forest classes analyzed. Likewise, the diversity profiles generated from the Hill series were significantly different from each other, and the floristic similarity varied between regeneration strata over time. For the forest classes, the similarity values ranged between 50% and 96%. The gap-phase forest areas had the lowest similarity values, with some 100% dissimilar surveys. However, there was an exponential reduction in similarity over time in the different forest classes. The results indicate that logging promotes significant changes in floristic structure and diversity in different strata of natural regeneration and forest classes over time. Additionally, no correlation was found between climate variables and the natural regeneration dynamics in the Tapajós National Forest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical peatlands are threatened by climate change and land-use changes, but there remain substantial uncertainties about their present and future role in the global carbon cycle due to limited measurements. Here, we present measurements of carbon dioxide and methane emissions between mid-2017 and mid-2020 as well as nitrous oxide emissions between 2019 and 2020 at two contrasting sites at a coastal peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia. We find that greenhouse-gas emissions from intact peatland increased substantially due to an extreme drought caused by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole phase combined with El Niño. The emission in the degraded site was two times greater than that at the intact site. The smaller emission from the intact peatland suggests that protecting the remaining intact tropical peatlands from degradation offers important climate benefits, avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions of 24 ± 5 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1 (average ± standard deviation) at our study site in Indonesia. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The largest and most dynamic agricultural frontier in Brazil is known as MATOPIBA, an area that covers part of the Cerrado biome. Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest.  © 2020 Dionizio et al.

AB  - Globally, many parts of fire emissions are driven by deforestation. However, few studies have attempted to evaluate deforestation and vegetation degradation fires (DDF) and predict how they will change in the future. In this study, we expanded a fire model used in the Community Land Model to reflect the diverse causes of DDF. This enabled us to differentiate DDFs by cause (climate change, wood harvesting, and cropland, pastureland, and urban land-use changes) and seasonality. We then predicted the state of fire regimes in the 2050s and 2090s under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Our results indicate that the area affected by global total fires will decrease from the current 452 to 211–378 Mha yr−1 in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and to 184–333 Mha yr−1 under RCP 2.6, mainly due to socioeconomic factors such as population and economic growth. We also predict that DDF will decrease from the current 73 million hectares per year (Mha yr−1) to 54–66 Mha yr−1 in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and 46–55 Mha yr−1 under RCP 2.6. The main contributor to these decreases in DDF burned area was climate change, especially the increasing of precipitation. The impact of future land use change on future DDF was similar or slightly lower than present-day. South America, Indonesia, and Australia were identified as high-risk regions for future DDF, mainly due to the expansion of wood harvest and pastureland. Appropriate land and fire management policies will be needed to reduce future fire damage in these areas. © 2021. The Authors.

AB  - Water as vital needs to our life must be fulfilled. Increasing population tends to water scarcity causes by the high demand and limited source. Water reuse is one of the solutions to face the challenge. Helminth eggs is one of the parameters for water reuse recommended by WHO. Previous studies have shown that there are helminth eggs presence in irrigation water and wastewater system in Indonesia, thus the possibility of disease by helminth eggs presence. This study was conducted to give an advice about the importance of helminth eggs assessment in Indonesia for better water reuse and prevent disease like soil-transmitted helminthiases. To detect the presence of helminth eggs in water, adaptations from several existing methods is required. Indonesia needs an exact method to determine the presence of helminth eggs. Government, institutions, and society have to collaborate to prevent the existence of helminth eggs for the water reuse purpose in the future. This can lead to increase quality of health and environment aspects.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the implementation of forest fire management and control policies in the perspective of the Indonesian and Malaysian governments. The research method used a qualitative approach, data analysis This study used a qualitative approach. The results showed the Dilemmas and Challenges of Haze Handling in Border Areas (1). It is traced to procedural norms and behavior embedded in the doctrine called the ASEAN Way which its members uphold. One such norm is the principle of enforcement of non-intervention and mutual respect. at the ASEAN level to combat environmental pollution has been deepened, with the introduction of various cooperative measures and projects, including haze mitigation initiatives (2). Indonesian Government Policy Approach in Haze Disaster Management in Perbatasana Area. (A) Diplomacy Steps. First track diplomacy in the form of bilateral diplomacy has been carried out by the Government of Indonesia and the Government of Malaysia since 1985. The Ministry of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, clarified that the Memorendum of Understanding (MoU) contains provisions for land clearing without burning (zero burning). Second track diplomacy between Indonesia and Malaysia on the issue of haze in Indonesia has been carried out since 1998 by several non-governmental organizations such as: Greenpeace, Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), World Wide Fund (WWF) Indonesia. World Wind Fund dor Nature (WWF) Malaysia and the Global Environment Center (GEC). The non-governmental organization assists the first track diplomacy in realizing negotiations, in the form of preventing, providing information on the causes, impacts, losses of the haze, conducting technical exercises, and scientific research on forest fires that can cause haze. (B) Steps Through Court Roads The resolution of forest and land fires has been mostly through civil court proceedings, where the state, represented by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), has filed a lawsuit. Of the many complaints, only a few have reached court proceedings and the results have been unsatisfactory, ranging from light sanctions decisions to acquittals. Not to mention that it takes a long and convoluted process as well as the energy- draining problem of witnesses and evidence. The provisions regarding forest fires/burning in the forestry law actually do not give adequate attention to fire control efforts, because the prohibition on burning forests contained in the forestry law can actually be countered for special purposes as long as it obtains permission from the authorized official. Until now, there has not been a single law that prohibits clearing land by burning forests. Although there are forest and land fire control centers in the regions, but because of the missing legal instruments, it does not function optimally. (C) Completion through Forest, Garden and Land Fire Prevention Pilot Project (Ministry of Economic Affairs) The concept of this project focuses on early warning, early detection, early suppression, and center assistance. This pilot project will be carried out in villages bordering forest and plantation concessions of stakeholders who are committed to participating in the development of forest, land and plantation fire prevention.Through this pilot project, the government can formulate a concept of best practices and a well-tested standard operating procedure (SOP) for fire prevention which can be effectively applied across villages throughout Indonesia. (3) Malaysian Approach to Combating and Managing Transboundary Haze Pollution Most of these actions are in the form of policy and legal reforms, with a focus on regulating and eliminating sources of environmental pollution, including haze. In addition, over the years, the Malaysian government’s approach to the haze problem evolved into a multi- pronged strategy involving all federal and state agencies. Therefore, in cooperation with the Indonesian and provincial governments, it is in the interest of Malaysia to play an important role in preventing the widespread incidents of open burning on these plantations which are a major contributor to the haze. The following discussion will describe the policy and legal initiatives undertaken by Malaysia on the issue of transboundary haze. © 2021

AB  - Tropical savanna ecosystems play a major role in the seasonality of the global carbon cycle. However, their ability to store and sequester carbon is uncertain due to combined and intermingling effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change, which impact wildfire regimes and vegetation dynamics. Accurate measurements of tropical savanna vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) over broad spatial scales are crucial to achieve effective carbon emission mitigation strategies. UAV-lidar is a new remote sensing technology that can enable rapid 3-D mapping of structure and related AGB in tropical savanna ecosystems. This study aimed to assess the capability of high-density UAV-lidar to estimate and map total (tree, shrubs, and surface layers) aboveground biomass density (AGBt) in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado). Five ordinary least square regression models estimating AGBt were adjusted using 50 field sample plots (30 m × 30 m). The best model was selected under Akaike Information Criterion, adjusted coefficient of determination (adj.R2), absolute and relative root mean square error (RMSE), and used to map AGBt from UAV-lidar data collected over 1,854 ha spanning the three major vegetation formations (forest, savanna, and grassland) in Cerrado. The model using vegetation height and cover was the most effective, with an overall model adj-R2 of 0.79 and a leave-one-out cross-validated RMSE of 19.11 Mg/ha (33.40%). The uncertainty and errors of our estimations were assessed for each vegetation formation separately, resulting in RMSEs of 27.08 Mg/ha (25.99%) for forests, 17.76 Mg/ha (43.96%) for savannas, and 7.72 Mg/ha (44.92%) for grasslands. These results prove the feasibility and potential of the UAV-lidar technology in Cerrado but also emphasize the need for further developing the estimation of biomass in grasslands, of high importance in the characterization of the global carbon balance and for supporting integrated fire management activities in tropical savanna ecosystems. Our results serve as a benchmark for future studies aiming to generate accurate biomass maps and provide baseline data for efficient management of fire and predicted climate change impacts on tropical savanna ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The utilization of peatlands as agricultural areas that do not pay attention to proper water management will result in peatland degradation. To restore the degraded peatlands, it is necessary to explore the peat's hydrological and physical characteristics. Therefore this study investigates the hydro-physical peat characteristics in the peatlands that have been converted into agricultural use. The research was carried out in the Liang Anggang Protected Forest area, specifically in the area converted to agricultural land. Undisturbed peat samples were collected in both intensive and un-intensive agricultural sites. Peat characteristics were analysed in the laboratory include bulk density, particle density, porosity, total soil water content, and hydraulic conductivity variables. The result shows that peat characteristics in the intensive agricultural land significantly indicate higher bulk density and particle density with the values 0.30 g/cm3 and 0.91 g/cm3, respectively. Still, significantly lower values are found in porosity (66.87%), total soil water content (226.95%), and hydraulic conductivity (0.0025 cm/s). Degraded peatland restoration that functions as a protected forest must be carried out through rewetting activities and maintaining the water table depth. On the other side, the peatland whose function is designated as an agricultural area, wetland farming systems should be applied using adaptive crop species. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem. We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference. We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years. We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often. Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow. ​. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - N-fixing leguminous species can reach atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N2), having an advantage under N-limited degraded environments. These N-fixers are constantly used as facilitative species. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChF) acknowledges how different species take up and use light energy during photosynthesis. These techniques assess stress and performance responses to photosynthesis and are used for the selection of species with potential for reforestation. Six Fabaceae species were selected for this study: three nonfixing species (Cenostigma tocantinum, Senna reticulata and Dipteryx odorata) and three N-fixing species (Clitoria fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Acacia spp.). Variations in chlorophyll fluorescence under high vs. low water and nutrient conditions were studied. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the effects of seasonality and fertilization on dark-adapted ChF two years after the experiment was established. The correlation among ChF variables and growth, photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations was evaluated. Under high water- and nutrient-availability conditions, plants exhibited an enhanced performance index on absorption basis values correlated with electron transport fluxes. Under drought and nutrient-poor conditions, most species exhibit increased energy dissipation as photoprotection. High interspecific variation was found; therefore, species-specific responses should be considered in future ChF studies. Corroborating the ability to colonize high-light environments, N-fixers showed an increased performance index correlated with electron transport and Zn and N foliar concentrations. Negative correlations were found between photosynthesis and trapped fluxes. Diameter growth was positively correlated with electron transport fluxes. Given the different responses among species, ChF is an effective technique to screen for seasonality, fertilization and species effects and should be considered for use during forest restoration. Finally, the addition of fertilization treatments may facilitate tropical forest restoration due to the importance of nutrients in physiological processes. N-fixers showed high photochemical performance and tolerance to abiotic stress in degraded areas and therefore should be included to support ecosystem biomass restoration.  © 2021 Jaquetti et al.

AB  - Agroforestry is an agricultural system that many people use in mountainous areas. Some experts have proven that this system can become the mitigation strategy in volcano areas. This study analyzes the risk and hazard perception of agroforestry adopters and non-adopters in the Mt. Merapi prone area. 139 agroforestry adopters and 130 non-adopters were randomly taken from four different areas in Mt. Merapi. Results show that both adopters and non-adopters show different perceptions regarding hazards and risk. The effectiveness of agroforestry practice for mitigation strategies needs to be studied more. The awareness of hazards and risks in the Mt. Merapi prone area is essential to save more lives during the eruption. The challenge is how to persuade agroforestry adopters and non-adopters to flee when the big eruption comes. Even though they flee, they still insist on returning home to take care of their livestock, farm, and protect properties. Mitigation education is needed; also, the infrastructure is important in supporting the mitigation efforts. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change represents an unprecedented threat to global biodiversity and, for many species, gaps in our knowledge of their biology remain acute. Gaps in baseline knowledge, such as confirmed identifications (Linnean shortfalls) and adequate collections (Wallacean shortfalls), need to be minimized with new studies, since this is often critical for effective conservation. Despite the increase in scientific research on primates in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon, little is known about the species Mico nigriceps (Ferrari & Lopes, 1992) Primates, Platirryni. In the current study, we sought to reduce the extent of the Wallacean shortfall for M. nigriceps, understand whether climate change represents a threat to the distribution of the species, and identify priority areas for its conservation. Accordingly, we provide 121 new records in 14 locations, obtained directly from the field, and five from the literature. Using this, we carried out ecological niche modeling, to better understand how environmental suitability might limit the area occupied by the species. We then projected a distribution for 2070 with the SSP2-4.5 (more optimistic) and SSP5-8.5 (more pessimistic) scenarios. Our data confirmed the geographic distribution of the species as being restricted to headwaters of the Ji-Paraná/Machado river, but with a 400 km extension to the south. Under the modeled climate change scenarios, the area suitable for the species declines by 21% under the most optimistic, and by 27% in the pessimistic, scenario across the projected 50-year period. Although we have expanded the area of known occurrence for this species, we point out that climate change threatens the stability of this newly-discovered population strongly, and that this danger is intensified by deforestation, fire and hunting. We recommend that further studies be carried out to confirm the presence of the species in adjacent areas, those indicated by generated models as being potential environmentally suitable. In addition, we recommend intensifying forest restoration in currently pastured areas, and protection of the areas forming the current and future habitat of this species through such measures as protected area creation.  © 2021 Gusmão et al.

AB  - The most severe global warming is predicted to occur in the Amazon region of Brazil, with an estimated temperature increase of 4 to 8 °C between 2071 and 2100. Our study evaluated the effects of increased temperatures on germination success of seeds in the soil seed bank of secondary forests in Central Amazonia. Soil samples (3-cm depth) were collected in six secondary forests with different land-use histories and ages of regrowth. Soils from all sites were sieved and mixed, and germination and seedling development were assessed during 4 months of incubation in germination chambers at (1) a constant temperature of 25 °C and a 12:12 h alternating temperature regime of 20:30 °C, considered as controls; (2) a simulated 5 °C temperature increase to 30 °C and 25:35 °C and (3) a 10 °C temperature increase to 35 °C and 30:40 °C. To determine the effect of light vs. dark on germination, germination was compared for samples in light (12 h daily photoperiod) vs. continuously dark for 1 month, followed by 3 months in light. Six temperature conditions were tested with 30 subsamples each. In the mixed soil seed bank, 3640 seeds germinated, of which 18 families, 28 genera and 41 species (grouped in 20 trees, 11 shrubs, eight herbs and two lianas) could be identified. A light requirement for germination was detected for 94–97% of the species. Alternating temperatures did not stimulate germination in the dark. Seedling density m−2 was 1.7 to 2.3 times higher at alternating (20:30 °C and 25:35 °C) than at constant temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C); but an increase of 10 °C decreased seedling density to 47% at 35 °C and 26% at 30:40 °C compared to control (100% at 25 °C and 20:30 °C); and furthermore increased seedling mortality. Thus, the secondary forest at the study area may maintain its integrity with a 5 °C but not with a 10 °C temperature increase. Species-specific sensitivities to temperature were detected. Temperature may function to fine-tune germination at a specific microsite, and the variety of germination requirements may enhance coexistence and maintenance of species diversity within the pioneer species subset. In general, seeds of tree species were more sensitive to increased temperatures than those of shrubs and herbs, supporting the hypothesis of replacement of the tropical forest by savanna-like vegetation in the Amazon region. Our results show that natural regeneration may be significantly affected by global warming and with potential to alter floristic composition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agriculture and soil management practices are closely related to CO2 emissions in crop fields. These practices directly interfere on the carbon dynamics between the land and atmosphere. In this study, we investigated the temporal variability of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (xCO2), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in areas with the main agroecosystems in southern-central Brazil as a way to understand if and how crops cycle and agricultural management could be associated with the temporal variability of NDVI, SIF and xCO2. The study was carried out in areas corresponding to the three agroecosystems’: sugarcane (Pradópolis, State of São Paulo, Brazil), cropland with soybean-corn succession (Santo Antônio do Paraíso, State of Paraná, Brazil), and grassland (Águas Claras, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil). Air temperature, precipitation, NDVI, and SIF and xCO2 were retrieved from NASA-POWER, NASA-GIOVANNI, SATVeg-EMBRAPA, and OCO-2, respectively, during a two-year study. Trends were removed from the NDVI, SIF, and xCO2 time series applying the regression method. A negative correlation between SIF and xCO2 was found in sugarcane and cropland areas, but in grasslands, no correlation showed up. Higher SIF values were observed in grassland (2.24 W m−2 sr−1 μm−1), and lower xCO2 values were observed above grains, which varied from 396.8 to 404.2 ppm. Both xCO2 and SIF followed more a seasonal pattern in sugarcane and annual crops, but over pasture this presented an unusual pattern related to higher precipitation events. Our results indicate a potential use of SIF and xCO2 which could help identifying potential sources and sinks of the main additional greenhouse gas over agricultural areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Study region: The Muda River Basin (MRB), Malaysia. Study Focus: This study proposed a framework to improve the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI LC) products through the integration with the Annual Oil Palm Dataset (AOPD). The improved land use land cover (LULC) maps were then used to produce five LULC scenarios as input maps into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for analyzing the impact of LULC changes on water balance in the MRB. New hydrological insights for the region: The improved LULC maps have good performance in representing rubber and oil palm, with an overall accuracy up to 81 %. In addition, SWAT simulated monthly streamflow well for the MRB, with the highest R2 and NSE values of 0.84 and 0.86, respectively. During the 2001–2016 period, the MRB experienced an expansion of oil palm from 7.10%–17.36 %, a reduction of rubber from 34.93 % to 26.38 % and a slight decrease in forest from 54.23%–52.80 %. The urban expansion scenario showed significant increment in surface runoff, while the reforestation scenario helped to reduce surface runoff, while increase lateral flow and groundwater. Oil palm expansion led to a higher reduction in lateral flow and groundwater than rubber trees due to the higher soil water absorption rate. The proposed framework can be duplicated and applied in other tropical basins, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Uncontrolled expansion of urban areas over mangrove systems is a historical threat for conservation and restoration of coastal landscapes. In Brazil, a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet, recent political changes considered mangroves as “Permanent Preservation Areas” with the environmental function of preserving their ecosystem services. Under this regulation, mangrove deforestation is allowed in cases of regularization of irregular occupations and consolidated urban areas. However, these political changes may not be an effective to prevent mangrove deforestation in the country. This study aimed to analyze mangrove deforestation over twenty years in Santos and São Vicente estuarine region located at the Baixada Santista region (southeastern of Brazil), a highly vulnerable region subject to intense land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Using remote sensing spatial analysis techniques, we analyzed if changes in Brazilian legislation has been reflected in degradation of mangrove forests over a period of twenty years due to the presence of vulnerable mangroves and accelerate land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Findings show that, approximately 10.6 km2 of mangroves in this region have been lost mainly due to irregular low-income occupation processes. The greatest gross loss occurred between the years 1999 and 2011 (8.1 km2). Land regularization has caused mangrove reduction of only 0.03 km2 in 2014, but it is possible that, in this case, mangrove forests were replaced by distinct vegetation physiognomy altering the original vegetation pattern. Demand for mangrove legislation that considers both social adaptation and legal protection has grown to support socioenvironmental vulnerability assessments. The data of this study can support environmental policy in a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet. © 2020

AB  - In the Brazilian Amazon, nitrogen input strategies are required to maintain forage–livestock systems productivity. However, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions mitigation from tropical soils is also a global demand. This research aims to assess productivity and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from Oxisol cultivated with Marandu palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha [Hochst. Ex A.Rich.] Stapf) submitted to nitrogen (N) input strategies (N fertilization and biological N fixation) in the Brazilian Amazon. The treatments were the following: control (unfertilized); U40 (fertilized with 40 kg N/ha as urea); U80 (fertilized with 80 kg N/ha as urea); AS40 (fertilized with 40 kg N/ha as ammonium sulfate); AS80 (fertilized with 80 kg N/ha as ammonium sulfate); and IAB (inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense). From January to March 2016, soil N2O emission, forage accumulation (FA) and relative emission (RE) were assessed during two 28-day cycles. The FA was greater in the U80 and AS80 than in control and IAB. The highest peaks of soil N2O flux occurred from 4 to 7 days after N fertilization, primarily in the highest N rates treatments. Overall, 40 kg N/ha resulted in higher N2O flux than control and IAB, which were lower than 80 kg N/ha regardless of the N source. The lowest fluxes occurred in the control and IAB (below 20 μg N-N2O m−2 hr−1). All of the emission factors (EF) calculated for both fertilizers and rates were lower than 0.35%, which is below the 1% established by the IPCC. Our results indicate the need for discussion of the EF in the pasture intensification to contribute to avoid deforestation and mitigating emissions. The inputs of 40 kg N/ha per application with urea or ammonium sulfate, due to the low EF and RE, are recommended as a pasture N input strategy in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2020 Japanese Society of Grassland Science

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivation leaves behind around 20 t ha−1 of biomass residue after harvest and processing. We investigated the potential for sequestering carbon (C) in soil with these residues by partially converting them into biochar (recalcitrant carbon-rich material). First, we modified the RothC model to allow changes in soil C arising from additions of sugarcane-derived biochar. Second, we evaluated the modified model against published field data, and found satisfactory agreement between observed and predicted soil C accumulation. Third, we used the model to explore the potential for soil C sequestration with sugarcane biochar in São Paulo State, Brazil. The results show a potential increase in soil C stocks by 2.35 ± 0.4 t C ha−1 year−1 in sugarcane fields across the State at application rates of 4.2 t biochar ha−1 year−1. Scaling to the total sugarcane area of the State, this would be 50 Mt of CO2 equivalent year−1, which is 31% of the CO2 equivalent emissions attributed to the State in 2016. Future research should (a) further validate the model with field experiments; (b) make a full life cycle assessment of the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation, including additional effects of biochar applications on greenhouse gas balances. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Rural landscapes in many parts of Indonesia are rapidly being transformed, due to the expansion of agrocommodity plantations—oil palm in particular. At the same time, communities in those landscapes face declining crop yields and ecosystem degradation as a result of both climate and non-climate factors. We assessed local perceptions on climate stressors, adaptation and vulnerability using focus group discussions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. We found that the main perceived climatic stressors were extreme and unpredictable seasons, fires, and saltwater intrusion, affecting ecosystem services and agricultural production. Land clearing and forest loss were mentioned as exacerbating non-climatic stressors. Respondents indicated willingness to adapt to these changes by investing in long-term measures, such as tree-planting. To adapt to yield declines, respondents indicated that many farmers shifted from rubber to oil palm. Such adaptation actions benefit households in the short term but may be at odds with long-term adaptation objectives at the landscape level. Finally, we found that perceptions about vulnerability differed between landscapes, and between communities at the landscape level and stakeholders at the district level. This stresses the importance of participatory and inclusive planning and multi-stakeholder processes towards context-based climate action planning to accommodate the differences in contexts and scale, and to reconcile the differences in perceptions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Aims: Increased nitrification risks accelerating soil acidification under land-use change from tropical forest to cropland or plantation, but acidity might be neutralized by net mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) that has accumulated under the former fallow vegetation. We aim to analyze key drivers of soil acidification and acid neutralization under different crops and fallow vegetation. Methods: We compared 30 year changes in soil C stocks, pH, and exchangeable Al under different land-uses (primary dipterocarp forest, Macaranga forest, Imperata grassland, Imperata grassland converted to Acacia plantation, Imperata grassland converted to oil palm plantation) in Indonesia and identified the major drivers of acidification using proton budgets in soil. Results: Nitrification is major driver of acidification in soil profiles under N-fixing Acacia or fertilized oil palm plantation. Protons generated by product removal and nitrification in oil palm plantation are neutralized partly by fertilizer and mineralization of the native SOM that has formerly accumulated under grassland. The remaining acidity results in accumulation of soil exchangeable Al. The SOM storage under short-term (< 10 yr) grass or long-term (> 10 yr) Macaranga forest increases without intensive acidification, while long-term Acacia plantation maximizes both SOM storage and acidification. Conclusion: Magnitude of soil acidification is regulated largely by the balance between proton generation by nitrification of fertilized N and biologically-fixed N and proton consumption by net mineralization of the native SOM that has formerly accumulated under grass fallow. SOM accumulation under Imperata grassland or Macaranga forest could mitigate soil acidification in Acacia or oil palm plantation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Differently from commonly used forest conservation strategies, the absence of disturbance in non-forest-ecosystems can result in loss of biodiversity. Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision-makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Climate change has become an pivotal issue and impacted on the socio-economic community because it contributes not only to prolonged land droughts and fires in the dry season but also to increased rainfall and flooding in the wet season. One of the climate change phenomena in Indonesia is El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) consisting of El Nino and La Nina. The ENSO phenomenon drives rainfall variability that impacts on the agricultural sector which depends on water availability. The objective of this study was to analyse the impact of El Nino and La Nina on the prices of six agricultural food crops using static panel data. The data used consist of 23 provinces affected by El Nino and La Nina in 2010-2017. Rainfall is used as a proxy for El Nino and La Nina, supported by a negative and significant correlation between Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and rainfall. The results showed that El Nino has greater impacts on food prices than La Nina by increasing the price of rice, sweet potato, and mung bean. While La Nina has a significant impact in increasing the price of cassava. Considering the importance of food crops for Indonesians, efforts can be made to improve community resilience, such as using adaptive varieties of climate, developing agricultural insurance, time and planting patterns adjustment and agroforestry patterns for communities nearby the forests in the framework of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ultimately, this study can provide important insights to formulate effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the climate change impact.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia’s population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of ~400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Deforestation in Indonesia in recent decades has made increasingly large parts of the region vulnerable to fires. Burning is particularly widespread in deforested peatlands, and it leads to globally significant carbon emissions. Here we use satellite-based observations to assess loss and fragmentation of primary forests and associated changes in fire regimes in Sumatra and Kalimantan between 2001 and 2019. We find that fires did not penetrate undisturbed primary forest areas deeper than two kilometres from the forest edge irrespective of drought conditions. However, fire-resistant forest now covers only 3% of peatlands and 4.5% of non-peatlands; the majority of the remaining primary forests are severely fragmented or degraded due to proximity to the forest edge. We conclude that protection and regeneration of the remaining blocks of contiguous primary forest, as well as peatland restoration, are urgently needed to mitigate the impacts of potentially more frequent fire events under future global warming. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the Amazon rainforest, land use following deforestation is diverse and dynamic. Mounting evidence indicates that the climatic impacts of forest loss can also vary considerably, depending on specific features of the affected areas. The size of the deforested patches, for instance, was shown to modulate the characteristics of local climatic impacts. Nonetheless, the influence of different types of land use and management strategies on the magnitude of local climatic changes remains uncertain. Here, we evaluated the impacts of large-scale commodity farming and rural settlements on surface temperature, rainfall patterns, and energy fluxes. Our results reveal that changes in land–atmosphere coupling are induced not only by deforestation size but also, by land use type and management patterns inside the deforested areas. We provide evidence that, in comparison with rural settlements, deforestation caused by large-scale commodity agriculture is more likely to reduce convective rainfall and increase land surface temperature. We demonstrate that these differences are mainly caused by a more intensive management of the land, resulting in significantly lower vegetation cover throughout the year, which reduces latent heat flux. Our findings indicate an urgent need for alternative agricultural practices, as well as forest restoration, for maintaining ecosystem processes and mitigating change in the local climates across the Amazon basin. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Understanding the processes that underlie the effects of tree diversity on primary production is of foremost importance to enhance climate change mitigation by tropical forests. Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama—Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil—Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures). We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species. Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception. Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs. © 2021 British Ecological Society

AB  - To mitigate anthropogenic impacts on plant diversity in tropical montane grasslands, one of the most threatened ecosystems in Brazil, it will be essential to develop ex situ conservation strategies to preserve wild species. The lack of basic research on the seed storage behaviour of grassland species may, however, limit their use for reintroduction and restoration projects. We investigated seed storage behaviour at the community level by comparing the effects of cold–low RH (10 °C; 10% RH) and freezing–low RH (20 °C; 10% RH) conditions on seed viability, germination and dormancy of 47 species. Fresh seeds of 43% of the species showed primary dormancy. More than half of the species showed high seed survival responses (viability >60%) under both storage temperatures. Despite a variety of dormancy responses among the different species, the low RH storage conditions tested released dormancy for most species during 12- and 30-month storage times. Multivariate analysis of the best (freezing–low RH, 30 months) storage condition evidenced the formation of five distinct groups, three with species having high conservation potential in seed banks. Although further studies are needed to test dormancy-breaking treatments and improve seed conservation practices, this first approach to assessing seed banking techniques could contribute to demand for locally adapted seeds for ecological restoration projects in tropical montane grasslands. © 2021 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands

AB  - Plant species models are among the available tools to predict the future of ecosystems threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and degradation. However, they suffer from low to no inclusion of plant dispersal, which is necessary to predict ecosystem evolution. A variety of seed dispersal models have been conceived for anemochorous and zoochorous plant species, but the coupling between vegetation models and seed dispersal processes remains rare. The main challenge in modelling zoochoric dispersal is simulating animal movements in their complex habitat. Recent developments allow straightforward applications of hidden Markov modelling (HMM) to animal movements, which could ease generalizations when modelling zoochoric seed dispersal. We tested the use of HMM to model seed dispersal by an endangered primate in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, to demonstrate its potential simplicity to simulate seed dispersal processes. We also discuss how to adapt it to other species. We collected information on movement, fruit consumption, deposition, and habitat use of Leontopithecus chrysomelas. We analysed daily trajectories using HMM and built a deterministic Model Of Seed Transfer (MOST), which replicated, with good approximation, the primate's movement and seed deposition patterns as observed in the field. Our results suggest that the dispersal behaviour and short daily-trajectories of L. chrysomelas restrict the species' role in large-scale forest regeneration, but contribute to the prevalence of resource tree species locally, and potentially maintaining tree diversity by preventing local extinction. However, it may be possible to accurately simulate dispersal in an area, without necessarily quantifying variables that influence movement, if the movement can be broken down to step-length and turning angles, and parametrised along with the distribution of guttransit times. For future objectives, coupling MOST with a DVM could be used to test hypotheses on tree species survival in various scenarios, simulating regeneration and growth at regional scales by including data on main dispersal agents over the area of interest, distribution of tree species, and land use data. The principal advantage of the MOST model is its functionality with data available from the literature as the variables are easy to parametrise. We suggest using the coupled model to perform experiments using only available information, but varying the numbers and species of seed dispersers, or modifying land cover or configuration to test for possible thresholds preventing the extinction of selected tree species. © 2020 Raghunathan et al.

AB  - Soil compaction is one of the most relevant crop yield-limiting factors in no-till (NT) farming systems in southern Brazil. This study aimed to identify strategies to mitigate soil compaction and increase crop productivity at low, medium and high yield environments within a field. Treatments evaluated were: control (without intervention), PG (phosphogypsum), MC (mechanical chiselling), PCC (polyculture of cover crops), MC + PG, PCC + PG, MC + PCC and MC + PCC + PG. Soil physical and chemical attributes (soil macroporosity, bulk density, penetration resistance) and soybean yield (Glycine max L.) and black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) biomass production were evaluated. In the low and medium yield environments, MC + PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yields: 5,455 kg ha−1 and 5,534 kg ha−1, respectively. In the high yield environment, PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yield (5,579 kg ha−1), whereas MC decreased yields relative to the control. Black oat biomass production responded to the treatments similarly to soybean yields. Overall, integrating two or three decompaction strategies improved soil physical attributes in a greater proportion relative to single strategies and to the control, enhancing both soybean and black oat performances. Selection of the right decompaction strategies for each yield environment might help increase productivity under NT and optimize the use of time, labour, fuel and other resources. Highlights: Soil compaction limits crop yields under no-tillage farming in southern Brazil. Low, medium and high yield environments were delineated with precision agriculture tools. Single or integrated mechanical, chemical and biological soil decompaction strategies were tested. Soil decompaction strategies to increase soybean yields are specific to yield environments. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Simultaneous cultivation of agricultural and forest species may result in changes in plant community interactions, generating microclimatic changes within the understory and then modifying growth and yield characteristics of the intercropping systems. Thus, this study aimed to assess the radiation use efficiency, growth and yield of bean and soybean cultivated in succession under two arrangements of agroforestry and full sun. To these ends, two field experiments were conducted in Southern Brazil: bean in-season and soybean off-season. Absolute and relative growth rates, net assimilation rate, leaf weight ratio, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, radiation use efficiency and yield of bean and soybean were assessed. The solar radiation flux was modified by plant arrangement and tree canopy characteristics. Shading affected growth and yield characteristics and the radiation use efficiency of the studied crops. From the results obtained in this study, it is possible to recommend crop bean cultivation in agroforestry systems. However, for soybean, due to the reduced yields obtained in agroforestry systems, further research should be conducted in order to study more spaced arrangements and crop insertion in the early years of agroforestry, in order to enable its insertion in agroforestry systems in Southern Brazil. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) strategy provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice (Oryza sativa) production. The SSNM fertilizer recommendations are based on the yield goal approach, which has been frequently cited in empirical studies. This study evaluates the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice-producing countries around the world, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explore whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). The results suggest the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites—some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. The SOM also significantly affects the nitrogen fertilizer uptake. I conclude by suggesting that the SSNM strategy can be made to be more adaptive to farmer’s fields if these relationships are accounted for in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm. © 2020 by the author.

In this study, we evaluated the role of continental runoff and intrusion of oceanic water masses in the trophic state of the Bay of Santa Catarina Island (BSCI) over the last three decades (1993–2019) by using multiple biogeochemical and eutrophication assessment tools. The sub-watersheds of BSCI showed high concentrations of nutrients, fecal coliform and chlorophyll-a, directly correlated to the number of inhabitants. Worst-case scenarios were found in summer and fall seasons due to sewage inputs caused by mass tourism and the inefficiency or even absence of treatment systems, boosted by strong rainfall. The intrusion of the South Atlantic Central Water and the Plata Plume Water into the BSCI favored autotrophy in the summer and heterotrophy in the winter, coupled with low and high residence time, respectively. El Niño events enhanced rainfall and continental runoff, exporting elevated nutrients and phytoplankton biomass loads from the eutrophic rivers to the continental shelf. The pattern reverses during La Niña, when chlorophyll and nutrient peaks were detected inside the bay. Eutrophication evaluation indicated that the trophic state oscillated from moderate to high and that these conditions tend to remain the same in future scenarios due to the moderate residence time of the water, anthropogenic pressures, periodic algal blooms and the intrusion of nutrient-rich oceanic water masses. Management actions, such as the improvement of the wastewater treatment system and wetlands restoration, are needed in order to mitigate eutrophication and the loss of ecosystem services and functions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Upland forest cover in the Amazon basin has been reduced by land use changes, e.g., the establishment of hydropower plants. Such plants cause permanent flooding and may produce periodic flooding in adjacent upland forests. We determined the short- and long-term effects of artificial flooding on the soil chemistry of upland forests adjacent to the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, Amazonas State, Brazil. We randomized 20 sampling units in upland forests located on the banks of streams adjacent to the hydropower plant. Each sampling unit consisted of two paired forests: one artificial “flooded forest” near the stream and an unflooded “control forest.” We performed soil chemical analyses to determine the pH and total organic C, N, Al3+, and nutrient levels (P, Ca, Mg, and K). In the short term, flooding caused soil acidification, C loss, and increased soil nutrient availability, but this effect did not occur in the long term. In the long term, soil acidity decreased, C loss occurred, and available N cumulatively decreased because of annual flooding after the impoundment of the reservoir. These cumulative N losses, associated with high C emissions, may alter the regional climate and contribute to global climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Since 2016, peatland restoration policy is implemented in Central Kalimantan province through facilitation and coordination by Peat Restoration Agency (Badan Restorasi Gambut [BRG]), with the goals of reducing the peat subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to fire of peat areas. After years of implementation, local peat fires persist, however, and knowledge is still lacking about the challenges and opportunities for supporting the restoration process. This study examines policy implementation from the perspective of regional stakeholders by unraveling the dynamics of stakeholder interactions associated with the policy process. It reveals that the current state of governance somewhat restricts the ability of restoration actors to adaptively address emerging policy challenges and proposes measures for addressing these challenges. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Arabica is a global premium coffee commodity whose land suitability is vulnerable to climate change. The presence of exposure and sensitivity will have a potential impact such as a decrease in the quality and quantity of production. This study analyzes how the level of vulnerability of climate change to the development of land suitability of Arabica species and analyzes the potential of Arabica agroforestry by the community. The method used is quantitative with a quantitative approach that utilizes secondary data for spatial processing. Modeling results show that climate change leaves 6% of the area that has the suitability of Arabica species in Indonesia at this time. There is a 67% loss of land suitability nationally and has the potential to shift the new land suitability area by 28% in 2050. Many areas are at a moderate level of vulnerability that is lost, which is 87% of the total land suitability loss. The areas that have a very high value of climate change vulnerability is not necessarily a highly degraded land. The development of Arabica coffee agroforestry can contribute 29% to efforts to increase adaptation capacity to reduce climate change vulnerability from the perspective of land use diversification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Despite the importance of tropical forest conservation in achieving global sustainability goals and the key role of forest-risk commodity trade in driving deforestation, consumer country policy options for reducing imported deforestation have received limited scholarly attention. Drawing on gray literature and a European Commission public consultation, we identify 86 policy options for the European Union to address deforestation. We assess the political feasibility and map the “theory of change” (TOC)—the causal chain through which the policies address deforestation—for each of these policy options, identifying a trade-off between feasibility and potential impacts: information-based and cooperative policies, which dominate our sample, typically exhibit high feasibility, but mostly lack convincing TOCs, while more stringent regulatory and market-based policy options generally have lower feasibility. We propose three principles for overcoming the feasibility-impact dilemma: (1) build policies on proven TOCs, (2) use policy mixes, and (3) work with key stakeholders, supply chains, and regions. Images of distressed orangutans in Indonesia and forest fires in Brazil have increased public awareness of deforestation across the globe. Still, deforestation continues more or less unabated, driven by demand for forest-risk commodities, such as palm, soy, cocoa, and beef. What can the European Union (EU) and other consumer regions do to address this problem? Here we present 86 policy options for the EU to address tropical deforestation, identified through a review of gray literature and EU stakeholder consultation responses. Analyzing these, we show that policy options that are politically feasible policies tend to have a weaker theory of change—the causal chain through which the policies address deforestation—setting up a trade-off between feasibility and impact. However, there are exceptions, such as mandatory due diligence, which show potential impact and appear politically feasible. Through policy mixing and working with key stakeholders, supply chains, and producer regions, these barriers can be overcome.

AB  - Quantifying forest fires remain a challenging task for the implementation of public policies aimed to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we propose a new method to provide an annual burned area map of Mato Grosso State located in the Brazilian Amazon region, taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution sensors. The method consists of generating the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy–Vegetation), and Suomi NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) datasets. The shade fraction images highlight the burned areas, in which values are represented by low reflectance of ground targets, and the mapping was performed using an unsupervised classifier. Burned areas were evaluated in terms of land use and land cover classes over the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes in the Mato Grosso State. Our results showed that most of the burned areas occurred in non-forested areas (66.57%) and old deforestation (21.54%). However, burned areas over forestlands (11.03%), causing forest degradation, reached more than double compared with burned areas identified in consolidated croplands (5.32%). The results obtained were validated using the Sentinel-2 data and compared with active fire data and existing global burned areas products, such as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1, and Fire CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative) products. Although there is a good visual agreement among the analyzed products, the areas estimated were quite different. Our results presented correlation of 51% with Sentinel-2 and agreement of r2 = 0.31, r2 = 0.29, and r2 = 0.43 with MCD64A1, MCD45A1, and Fire CCI products, respectively. However, considering the active fire data, it was achieved the better performance between active fire presence and burn mapping (92%). The proposed method provided a general perspective about the patterns of fire in various biomes of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, that are important for the environmental studies, specially related to fire severity, regeneration, and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Trees are central in the Nature-based Solutions for promoting simultaneously quality of life and biodiversity while providing mitigation and adaptive ecosystem services in the cities. Based on the Geodesign framework using the GISColab Platform, the impact of decision-making scenarios on tree-cover changes, as well as the consequences it will have for carbon sequestration, was evaluated for 2020, 2035 and 2050 in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). This metropolitan area is one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world with more than 22 million people. It lies on the Atlantic Rainforest Biome, a tropical moist broadleaf forest regarded as a world hotspot of biodiversity. First, a diagnostic of the current conditions was elaborated using available layers of geospatial data from the MASP. Then the future tree cover was discussed according to three scenarios: i) the non-adopters that represent the business as usual; ii) the late-adopters that develop innovative actions from 2035; and iii) early-adopters that undertake innovative interventions of urban greening from 2020. The vegetation cover was estimated to be reduced by 4% considering the current non-adopter scenario by 2050. On the other hand, vegetation cover has the potential to increase 30% in 2050, once there is an early adoption of innovative interventions, promoting various ecosystem services and co-benefits that support the quality of life and the biodiversity in the MASP, while fostering the carbon credit in the city through vegetation carbon sink. This article points to possible pathways required to attain desired afforestation goals in the MASP following the Geodesign framework. This framework proved to be effective even though it was based only on remote meetings, imposed by the social distancing during the pandemic of COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The restoration methods applied on the areas affected by the Fundão tailings dam collapse have a high priority in Mariana region. We evaluated the effect of different restoration methods and site preparation techniques, depth and seasonality on penetration resistance of tailings, and how these predictors affect tree aboveground biomass in areas affected by the Fundão dam collapse in Mariana, Brazil. No significant differences in penetration resistance and aboveground biomass between treatments were observed, but significant differences were observed between seasonal periods. The main univariate model explained the significant effects of depth and seasonality, mainly by a negatively wet effect on penetration resistance. According to the best models (univariate and multivariate) were those that had depth as a predictor. This study showed how penetration resistance can be an indicator to select the best period for restoration process in areas affected by the collapse of the Fundão dam, but no limit to the aboveground biomass recovery on tailing. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Fire is an important ecological disturbance, but anthropogenic wildfires increasingly threaten native ecosystems and human lives. In fire-prone ecosystems, zero-fire policies have been replaced by active fire management to reduce the risk of wildfires and improve ecological outcomes. The environmental drivers of fire behavior are widely known, but climate change and deforestation are changing their roles, making fires less predictable. Thus, reassessing the main determinants of fire behavior is preeminent to allow for safe and adaptive uses of fire in protected areas (PA). We did this research in collaboration with PA managers during the initial implementation of a pilot Integrated Fire Management (IFM) program in the Brazilian savanna. The program mainly aimed to prevent large wildfires in the late-dry season and included prescribed burns during the rainy, early- and mid-dry seasons to create vegetation patch mosaics with different fire histories. We assessed fire behavior and its environmental drivers during prescribed fires in the mid-dry season (MF) and experimental late-dry season fires (LF) (emulating wildfires). We applied Linear Models to test for differences in fire intensity, heat released, combustion factor and flame height between fire seasons and to check the influence of meteorological and fuel conditions in these parameters. LF had a significantly higher fire intensity (3508 vs. 895 kW m−1), heat released (5537 vs. 3329 kW m−2), combustion factor (90 vs. 51%) and flame height (2.5 vs. 1.9 m) than MF. Relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and fuel load were the best predictors of fire behavior, corroborating previous research. Air temperature and relative humidity pushed the seasonal differences in fire behavior while wind speed and fuel load showed similar effects across seasons. Our results emphasize the importance of considering primarily environmental variables during fire management planning, especially in the current climate changing world where extreme events and seasonal weather fluctuations are constantly defying our knowledge about fire behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In almost all forms of agriculture and farming practice, land clearing is the initial step. In Indonesia, in general, the most cost effective means of clearing land is through the use of fire. However, this use of fire often results in uncontrolled outbreaks, particularly in lowland areas especially and during prolonged dry seasons. In recent years, these uncontrolled fire outbreaks have had a catastrophic environmental, social and economic impact. The Indonesian government has expressed a strong commitment to controlling these outbreaks, as demonstrated by a broad set of laws, regulations, decrees, guidelines, and directives to control and manage land and forest fire. However, despite these measures, the occurrence of widespread, high-intensity fire outbreaks is still unacceptably high. This study assessed land-clearing techniques associated with a low risk of fire outbreaks, comparing the costs associated with a range of these techniques. It then analyzed intervention options that would involve the adoption of these techniques by farmers. These low-risk techniques included: (i) zero-burning practices involving traditional machinery and farmer groups; (ii) zero-burning involving modern machinery and partnerships with government agencies/private enterprises; (iii) controlled burning; and (iv) the chemical removal of biomass using herbicides. The study finds that the costs for all four of these options are higher than with land-clearing techniques that use fire alone. However, it also showed that the cost implications for farmers could be mitigated by taking a more holistic view of farming practices as a system, rather than focusing only on land-clearing practices in isolation. It found that when land-clearing practices that involve low risks of fire outbreak are combined with good agricultural practices (GAP), farmers could still achieve higher levels of profitability and productivity than under a business as usual (BAU) scenario. The study produced scenarios involving BAU practices; land clearing without fire and with BAU practices; and land clearing without fire and with good agricultural practices (GAP) for four agricultural commodities (oil palm, cocoa, rubber, and paddy). It found that the return on land (NPV) in the case of the scenario involving land clearing without fire and with GAP was still higher than under the BAU scenario, except in the case of rubber, with which the NPV was higher in the scenario with modern machinery and GAP. The study concludes that a systems approach is necessary to effectively control fire outbreaks. Government programs should be designed and implemented on the basis of this systems approach with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including through partnerships with the private sector operators, to effectively control the risk of fire outbreaks while at the same time supporting farmers' livelihoods by ensuring that they are enabled to generate higher levels of productivity and profitability from their land. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield’s treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The number of clean water needed will always increase when the number of the population still shows growth. It must have the same level from the supply and demand or the supply of clean water has higher than the demand for clean water. Some cities in Indonesia have problems with the fulfilment of clean water. Factors from climate change, behaviour, and management can affect the conditions of clean water resources. The development of technologies and science makes the reuse of the water process can be done for another resource of clean water fulfilment. Rainwater harvesting, membrane bioreactors, reverse osmosis, and filtration systems are some kind of processing systems for the water mechanism for the fulfilment of clean water. Sustainable clean water resources and supply is one of the indicators of sustainable development goals. This research was conducted to see how is the potential of water reuse for the fulfilment of clean water in Indonesia by using several systems or processing that have been installed and used. The control and evaluation is the best key to make sure the clean water resources still in the best condition and water reuse is one of the plan to support fulfilment of clean water. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical forest habitats. Some of the fastest diminishing tropical forest habitats in the world occur in Indonesia, where fragmentation is severely impacting biodiversity, including on the island of Java, which holds many endemic species. Extreme fragmentation on the western part of the island, especially due to small-scale agriculture, impacts animal movement and increases mortality risk for mainly arboreal taxa. To mitigate this risk in an agroforest environment in Garut District, West Java, we installed 10 canopy bridges and monitored them through camera trapping between 2017 and 2019. Five of the monitored bridges were made of waterlines and five of rubber hose. We recorded Javan palm civets using the waterline bridges 938 times, while Javan slow lorises used the waterlines 1079 times and the rubber bridges 358 times. At least 19 other species used the bridges for crossing or perching. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple and cost-effective materials can be used to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. We also recommend the use of camera traps to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Relatively few studies have documented the impacts of afforestation, particularly production forestry, on belowground carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes to the atmosphere. We evaluated the changes in the soil CO2 efflux—a proxy for soil respiration (Rs)—for three years following a native grassland conversion to eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil where minimum tillage during site preparation created two distinct soil zones, within planting row (W) and between-row (B). We used root-exclusion and carbon (C)- isotopic approaches to distinguish Rs components (heterotrophic-Rh and autotrophic-Ra respirations), and a CO2 profile tube (1-m deep) to determine the concentration ([CO2]) and isotopic C signature of soil CO2 (δ13[CO2]). The soil CO2 efflux in the afforested site averaged 0.37 g CO2 m−2 h−1, which was 56% lower than the soil CO2 efflux in the grassland. The δ13CO2 in the afforested site ranged from − 14.1‰ to − 29.4‰, indicating a greater contribution of eucalypt-derived respiration (both Rh and Ra) over time. Higher soil CO2 efflux and lower [CO2] were observed in W than B, indicating that soil preparation creates two distinct soil functional zones with respect to C cycling. The [CO2] and δ13[CO2] decreased in both zonal positions with eucalypt stand development. Although the equilibrium in C fluxes and pools across multiple rotations is needed to fully account for the feedback of eucalypt planted forests to climate change, we provide quantitative information on soil CO2 dynamics after afforestation and show how soil preparation can leverage the feedback of planted forests to climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry has potential for strengthening the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, the food security challenges faced by smallholders will likely worsen due to climate change impacts. Agroforestry provides and option for strengthening climate change resilience, while contributing to food access, income, health, and environmental stability. To evaluate the evidence for such benefits, this systematic review identifies 22 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2019 which assess agroforestry’s contributions to food security in Indonesia, mostly in Java or Sumatra. Analysis of the studies indicate that traditional and commercial agroforestry contribute to food security in diverse ways: for example, traditional homegardens offer 20% more dietary diversity than commercial counterparts, while commercial homegardens may contribute up to five times more income. Agri-silviculture contributions fall along a timber versus non-timber forest product continuum that displays a similar tradeoff between diversity and income. Those systems with a commercial focus may receive 54% of their income from a single commodity crop such as coffee, while traditional systems allow greater access to plants with medicinal benefits. Nearly all agroforestry systems offered indirect benefits for food security, such as allowing more off-farm work than traditional agriculture and contributing to environmental stability: users of agroforestry were found by one study to collect 83% less fuelwood from natural forests. One study highlighted that agroforestry options have up to 98% greater net present value (for periods over 30 years) compared to slash and burn style agriculture. However, very few studies of Indonesian agroforestry focused explicitly on financial analysis and food security, indicating the need for further research. Given the similar situations faced by many Southeast Asia countries, our findings contribute to emerging trends throughout the region regarding the relationship between agroforestry and food security. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The inadequate management of soils and the absence of conservation practices favor the degradation of pastures and can trigger adverse environmental alterations and damage under the terms of Brazilian Federal Law no. 6.938/1981. Based on this premise, this study aimed to estimate soil losses caused by water erosion in pasture areas using the brightness index (BI) from the annual series of Landsat 8 images in different geological formations. A specifically prepared Google Earth Engine (GEE) script automatically extracted the BI from the images. The study occurred in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of Uberaba River basin (Minas Gerais, Brazil). To accomplish the goal, 180 digital 500-wide random buffers were selected from 3 geologic types (60 points per type), and then analyzed for zonal statistics of USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) soil loss and BI in a Geographic Information System. The regression models BI versus USLE soil loss allowed estimating BI soil losses over the pastures of EPA. The model fittings were remarkable. The validation of soil loss maps in the EPA occurred in pasture phytophysiognomies through the probing of penetration resistance in 37 randomly selected locations. The results were satisfactory, mostly those based on the BI. The BI losses increased for greater resistances. Amplified losses also occurred in regions exposed to environmental land use conflicts (actual uses that deviate from land capability or natural use). Overall, the BI approach proved efficient to accurately track soil losses and pasture degradation over large areas, with the advantage of standing on a single parameter easily accessed through remote sensed data. From an environmental standpoint, this is an important result, because the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of degraded pastures is paramount to implement mitigation measures following the “polluter pays principle”, even more in Brazil where the areas occupied by degraded pastures are enormous. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the last few decades, deforestation and climate change have caused increasing number of forest fires. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has been the most affected country by tropical peatland forest fires. These fires have a significant impact on the climate resulting in extensive health, social and economic issues. Existing forest fire prediction systems, such as the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, are based on handcrafted features and require installation and maintenance of expensive instruments on the ground, which can be a challenge for developing countries such as Indonesia. We propose a novel, cost-effective, machine-learning based approach that uses remote sensing data to predict forest fires in Indonesia. Our prediction model achieves more than 0.81 area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, performing significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds 0.70 area under ROC curve on the same tasks. Our model's performance remained above 0.81 area under ROC curve even when evaluated with reduced data. The results support our claim that machine-learning based approaches can lead to reliable and cost-effective forest fire prediction systems.

AB  - Drylands are experiencing an overall increase in aridity that is predicted to intensify in the future due to climate change. This may cause changes in the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems, affecting ecosystem services and human well-being. Therefore, detecting early signs of ecosystem change before irreversible damage takes place is important. Thus, here we used a space-for-time substitution approach to study the response of the plant community to aridity in a Tropical dry forest (Caatinga, Brazil), and infer potential consequences of climate change. We assessed plant functional structure using the community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity, measured through functional dispersion (FDis), along a 700 km climatic gradient. We studied 13 functional traits, reflecting strategies associated with establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal of the most abundant 48 plant species in 113 sampling sites. Spearman correlations were used to test the relation between aridity and single-trait functional metrics. Aridity was a major environmental filter of the plant community functional structure. We found a higher abundance of species with deciduous leaves, zoochorous dispersal, fleshy fruits, chemical defense exudation and spinescence, and crassulacean acid metabolism towards more arid sites, at the expense of species with evergreen and thicker leaves, autochory dispersal, and shrub growth-form. The FDis of leaf type and thickness decreased with aridity, whereas FDis of fruit type, photosynthetic pathway, and defense strategies increased. Our findings provide functional indicators to early detect climate change impacts on Caatinga structure and functioning, to timely adopt preventive measures (e.g. conservation of forest remnants) and restoration actions (e.g. introduction of species with specific functional traits) in this threatened and unique ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes (fLULCC) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and, hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale fLULCC is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, fLULCC estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based fLULCC in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the socalled loss of additional sink capacity (LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The fLULCC from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the fLULCC from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived fLULCC estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate-and CO2-induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global fLULCC (under transient conditions) of 2:00:6 PgC yr1 for 2009-2018, of which 40% are attributable to the LASC (0:80:3 PgC yr1). From 1850 onward, the fLULCC accumulated to 18956 PgC with 4015 PgC from the LASC. Around 1960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient fLULCC estimates to exceed estimates under presentday conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that fLULCC estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of fLULCC estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the fLULCC that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble fLULCC and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes (CO2 only). © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is an international mechanism linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It has been described in the field of political ecology as the panacea of neoliberal nature conservation policies, in particular though the decreasing role of the state in the definition and implementation of forest policies in favour of market-based-mechanisms and non-governmental actors. The article explores the links between the privatisation of forest conservation and national sovereignty in the context of limited statehood through a case study in the Mai Ndombe province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It proposes an original approach combining African political anthropology with Franz Neumann's political economy analyses of the power of authoritarian states. It argues that this model of forest conservation uses carbon accounting and results-based payment, which privileges private actors for the design and implementation of REDD+ activities; it also paradoxically strengthens Congelese state legitimacy. © 2021 ROAPE Publications Ltd.

AB  - The global demand for beef is rapidly increasing (FAO, 2019), raising concern about climate change impacts (Clark et al., 2020; Leip et al., 2015; Springmann et al., 2018). Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%–18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of “improved” versus “conventional” beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Global change drivers including eutrophication, hydrological disturbance, climate change, chemical pollution, overexploitation, invasive species, and land-use change are affecting the function and structure of freshwater ecosystems. South American freshwater ecosystems are especially threatened by the combination of rising human pressures on natural resources (i.e., water use, intensive agriculture, mining, deforestation, and afforestation) and the lack of adequate legislation and economic resources for environmental protection and restoration. We assess the state of freshwater ecosystems in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela, focusing on broad categories of human-induced threats grouped into 5 categories: climate change, watershed stressors, hydrological alteration, channel modification, and biological stressors. For most countries, the most severe threats are related to land uses such as mining, agriculture, and urban expansion. Other threats relate to the abstraction or wasteful use of water and the intense regulation of flows, including the effects of large hydraulic infrastructure. There is also an increasing need to empower public organisations that focus on environmental protection, to update or develop an adequate regulatory and legal framework, to provide adequate funding for the implementation of environmental legislation, and not least to implement ecological rehabilitation. Implementation of these steps would reduce the threats to South American aquatic ecosystems and allow progress toward the sustainable development of this region in future decades. © 2021 International Society of Limnology (SIL).

AB  - Forest conversion to agricultural land in the upstream area of Merawu watershed has changes the ecosystem composition and reduced the stability. Mass erosion and landslide occurred in the upstream and increased the ecosystem vulnerability. Tamansari and Penanggungan hamlets are prone to erosion, landslides and environmental pollution from intensive farming. Potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and chili are the main commodities planted, particularly in Penanggungan hamlet. Planting on the steep slope, intensive land mechanization and high intensity of pesticide spraying caused the area to be prone to ecosystem disasters such as erosion, landslides and environmental pollution. This study aims to determine the people's perceptions of ecosystem disasters and analyse the community adaptation and mitigation strategies. Community perceptions is analysed using Mann Whitney test, while adaptation and mitigation strategies using qualitative descriptive. The results showed that the upper Merawu watershed community's perceptions varied greatly by knowledge and attitudes of the community. Knowledge is affected by the intervention of PT. Indonesia Power and Field Extension Officer. Community attitudes are influenced by the type of land use and commodities planted. Adaptation actions practiced by the community include water drainage cleaning, application of intercropping, crop rotation and agroforestry. Mitigation actions carried out by the community include the construction of drainage channels, terraces, embankments, and planting of wood plants (structural mitigation) while mitigation carried out by the government is more towards non-structural mitigation such as socialization and training, planting joint seedlings and the establishment of disaster resilient village (i.e., Destanta). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate change may impose severe challenges to farmers to maintain agricultural production levels in the future. In this study we analysed the effect of projected changes in climate on the area suitable for coffee production in 2050, and the potential of agroforestry systems to mitigate these effects in a major coffee production region in southeast Brazil. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis with the bioclimatic model MaxEnt to explore the area that is suitable for coffee production in 2050 when coffee is grown in unshaded plantations and in agroforestry systems. The projected climate in 2050 was assessed using 19 global circulation models, and we accounted for the altered microclimate in agroforestry systems by adjusting the maximum and minimum air temperature. The climate models indicated that the annual mean air temperature is expected to increase 1.7 °C ± 0.3 in the study region, which will lead to almost 60 % reduction in the area suitable for coffee production in unshaded plantations by 2050. However, the adoption of agroforestry systems with 50 % shade cover can reduce the mean temperatures and maintain 75 % of the area suitable for coffee production in 2050, especially between 600 and 800 m altitude. Our study indicates that major shifts in areas suitable for coffee production may take place within three decades, potentially leading to land conflicts for coffee production and nature conservation. Incentives that contribute to the development of coffee agroforestry systems at appropriate locations may be essential to safeguard coffee production in the southeast of Brazil. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Restoring forests, especially within deforested or degraded protected areas, is critical to prevent global biodiversity loss and climate change. In this article, we explore the current conditions and progress of forest restoration in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. The aim of this research was to review forest restoration projects and their success in the park, and to analyse lessons learned from those projects. From 2009 till 2018, nearly 5000 ha of damaged forest in Gunung Palung National Park were replanted, but with only a 1% restoration success rate. The main reason for failed restoration is wildfire. We found four issues that should be resolved in forest restoration projects: fire management, weed management, cost calculation and defining an appropriate restoration strategy. Restoration projects in the park have estimated the price per seedling at around USD0.36 to USD0.78 for one year. We proposed a revised price per seedling of USD1 for the first year, with an additional 10 cents per year for the following three years, to account for maintenance and labour costs. One-time projects that focus only on planting are likely to fail, especially without fire prevention management. Successful forest restoration projects should do more than simply planting trees by also including care and maintenance after they are planted. With this in mind, we provide a standardised framework to guide decision-making and successful forest restoration. Our results should help increase forest restoration success, improve sustainability and allow for the persistence of forested landscapes. © 2020 Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Managing for resilience in agriculture will be required to overcome future challenges such as growing food demand, climatic uncertainty, scarce raw materials and economic instability. Identifying resilience-enhancing practices is therefore fundamental for developing sustainable agroecosystems. We aimed to assess the resilience of two agricultural systems with different levels of diversification in southern Brazil: a specialized soybean (Glycine max) system and an integrated soybean-beef cattle system. We assessed the robustness and the adaptive capacity of these systems when facing climate hazards and price volatility. The study was based on a long-term trial that has been carried out since 2001, composed of an annual rotation of no-till soybean production during the summer and grazing of mixed black oat (Avena strigosa) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) pasture in the winter. Treatments consisted of four grazing intensities in the integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS), defined by sward heights: 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm plus an ungrazed control representing the specialized cropping system (CS). The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. We analysed system results over five years using two methods: i) a downside risk analysis to estimate the expected losses of yield and gross value added; and ii) the Ecological Network Analysis, which was applied to each treatment and year, for the assessment of the resilience of nitrogen (N-Ɍflow) and phosphorus (P-Ɍflow) flows. Both methods showed that co-located crop-livestock production in an ICLS was more resilient than the specialized soybean system and had improved nutrient cycling and resource-use efficiency. The effects of grazing management on system resilience depended on the output: beef yields were more stable under lower grazing intensities, but the risk of falling below a target economic threshold was inversely proportional to grazing intensity and null when the highest grazing intensity was adopted. The ecological network analysis did not reveal differences in resilience of nutrient flows among grazing management treatments. Our study suggests that Ɍflow (N or P) is a useful proxy for assessing the robustness and adaptability of agroecosystems. Our comprehensive resilience analysis of nutrient and economic flows provides evidence that system diversification through the integration of grazing animals into specialized cropping systems is a good strategy towards the sustainable intensification of agriculture. It would be relevant, however, to consider further studies comparing more complex system configurations and levels of diversification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tietê Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the São Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An alluvial river system is a dynamic system that can alter the hydraulic flow and sediment load. Sediment modelling can enhance our understanding of river morphology. This model has also proved to be a useful tool to overcome problems concerning sediment transport and sedimentation and to provide effective mitigation measures. This article discussed the concept of sediment modelling. The sediment transport simulation method used sediment river hydraulic two dimension (SRH-2D), which is a hydraulic model for river systems developed by United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The SRH-2D results showed that the Krueng Baro River underwent many sedimentations, and the increase in the height of the layers was observed during the simulation period. It examined the main categories of sediment transport models and presented the boundaries. Besides, this study also considered the constraints on the operation of Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (Indonesian regional water utility company) (PDAM) and irrigation intakes because of the sedimentation in the Krueng Baro River flow, taking into account the structure of the Keumala weir. Specifically, this study thoroughly discussed the position and altitude of river aggradation and degradation to minimise conflict of interest between the PDAM and irrigation water supply because of sedimentation. © 2020.

AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the occurrence of fire foci during the severe drought that occurred in 2005 in the State of Amazonas. The study was conducted in the State of Amazonas, which is inserted in the northern region of Brazil. The main types of vegetation are Igapó Forest, Várzea Forest and Terra Firme Forest. Kernel density was used to spatialize fire foci to quantify them in seven classes of land use and cover (forest, pasture, exposed soil, urban area, pastoral agroforestry system, agroforestry system and agriculture). Through the regression analysis, the relation among the number of fire foci and four meteorological variables was obtained: rainfall, evapotranspiration, relative humidity and average air temperature. Forest and pasture classes were those with the highest number of fire foci corresponding, respectively, to 58 and 37% of the total number of foci. This can be explained by the greater representativeness of these classes in the State and by the high degree of soil exposure in the case of pasture. The number of fire foci was higher in the dry season, covering approximately 85% of the total fire foci. The variable that had the greatest influence on the occurrence of fire foci in the dry season was evapotranspiration. The study puts on alert the vulnerability of the State of Amazonas to the occurrence of fires and may also suggest actions to mitigate carbon emissions and biomass stock. Research like this one may provide subsidies to region’s managers in an attempt to preserve forest areas and a greater controlling in priority areas considered very high. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes have profound impacts on the functioning of (agro)ecosystems and have potential to mitigate global climate change. However, we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future LULC scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments. Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 × 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 % of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 %, and coffee from 3 to 11 %. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to its low global share of direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (1–2%), the implications of technological transitions in the agricultural and forestry sector on the energy system have been overlooked. This paper introduces the Agriculture and Land Use Sector module part of the ModUlar energy System Environment (MUSE), a novel energy system simulation model. The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways. To illustrate the model's capabilities, Brazil is used as case study. Outputs suggest that by 2030 under a 2 °C mitigation scenario, most of Brazil agricultural production would move from ‘transitional’ to ‘modern’ practices, improving productivity and reducing deforestation rates, at the expense of higher energy and fertiliser demand. By mid-century Brazil has the potential to liberate around 24.4 Mha of agricultural land, where large-scale reforestation could have the capacity to sequester around 5.6 GtCO2, alleviating mitigation efforts in the energy system, especially reducing carbon capture and storage technology investments in the industry and power sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems. Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted. During the 2019 El Niño, the involvement of a closed-loop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table, which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Trees’ growth responses to climate may depend on tree age and site conditions. In dioecious species, sex adds an extra level of complexity due to differential reproductive effort between the sexes and potentially sex-related dimorphic growth. Araucaria araucana is a long-lived dioecious conifer with outstanding morphological and functional adaptations considered an excellent model to explore interactions between radial growth, climate variability and reproductive effort. We assessed the potential dimorphism of growth rates of the sexes, the effects of site, tree age and sex on the individual climatic responses, and the growth-climate-cone production relationships of A. araucana in two environmentally contrasted sites at the Andes of south-central Chile. We quantified tree-ring growth, its dependence on weather variability, and the relationships of cone production with growth and climate. We found site-dependent sexually-dimorphic growth rates, with females growing more in the warmer site while males growing more in the colder site. Resource allocation to growth was dependent on weather conditions prior to the growing season. Clear effects of site conditions, tree sex and age on the responses of individual tree growth to climate were identified. A more resilient response to drought stress occurred in the colder site and female trees’ growth showed tighter limitations by winter snow cover. Warm conditions in spring and summer exerted an age-dependent detrimental effect on growth, which is coherent with earlier xylogenesis resumption in younger trees. Cone production was strongly dependent on antecedent weather conditions up to seven years prior to seed dispersal that induced female cone primordia formation and favoured fertilization of female cones and soil nutrient uptake. The revealed lagged connections between vegetative growth, weather cues and cone production point towards a long-term life strategy for A. araucana. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In fire-influenced savanna ecosystems, native and invasive exotic plants may use different abilities to coexist and compete for nutrients available in post-fire soil. The availability and uptake of nitrate by two C4 grasses (Urochloa brizantha (exotic invasive) and Axonopus siccus (native)) were characterized in an unburned area and in a recently burned area in the Cerrado of Southeastern Brazil. Ecophysiologic tests were performed to measure Nitrate Reductase Activity (NRA) and nitrate content in leaves and roots. Soil fertility was also analyzed. In the unburned area, organic matter (25.3 ± 2.4 g kg-1), phosphorus (19.0 ± 2.0 mg dm-3), and nitrate (19.9 ± 7.4 mg dm-3) levels were higher than in the recently burned area, which had 27% less cations in the soil. In comparison with soils from the recently burned and unburned areas, ashes of the recently burned area had higher pH, electrical conductivity and nitrate, potassium, and calcium contents. In both areas, the aboveground part of U. brizantha was more responsive to nitrate compared to A. siccus and both had low belowground NRA. This confirms the working hypothesis that the two species undergo distinct ecophysiologic processes and indicate the adaptive potential of U. brizantha to bypass soil nutrient limitation. © 2019 Université Laval.

AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006–2009; 2010–2013; and 2014–2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006–2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000–2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km2 lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 ± 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondônia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapá states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund. © Copyright © 2019 West, Börner and Fearnside.

AB  - The restoration of degraded environments is a challenging process due to the presence of adverse factors, which can prevent the establishment and development of forest species. The use of appropriate methods and species, which are able to adapt to the soil and climatic conditions, enable successful conservation plantings. Herein, we aim to identify the performance of native forest species grown under two planting models and different silvicultural practices in a degraded riparian area in the extreme south of the Atlantic Forest Biome. The experiment was initiated in September 2015 with a randomized block design arranged in a 3 × 2 factorial scheme (three silvicultural practices and two planting models). We evaluated the performance of nine native species by the analysis of morphological (i.e., survival, height, and stem diameter) and physiological attributes (i.e., photosynthetic pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence). The use of intensive silvicultural practices in restoration plantations maximized tree survival rates, height, and stem growth, and provided better values for the physiological attributes. The two planting models tested in this study (i.e., “framework species” and diversity) can be used in future restoration projects in subtropical regions associated with intensive silvicultural practices. Solanum mauritianum, among other studied species, presented excellent rates of survival and growth. Several secondary species (e.g., Actinostemon concolor, Trichilia elegans, and Eugenia rostrifolia) propagated from the seedling transplants, also showed the potential to enrich forest plantations in degraded environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils, especially when topsoil is removed by mining. This nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions, which have direct consequences for P availability to plants and, consequently, for restoration success. Therefore, understanding how the stocks of different soil P fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions, monitoring, and adaptive management. Here, we investigated the recovery of soil P fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic P at (1) a bauxite mine prepared for restoration; (2) two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years; and (3) an old-growth forest remnant. Overall, restored areas recovered levels of labile organic P (Po-NaHCO3) at 5–40 cm and of moderately labile organic P (Po-NaOH) at different depths, exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest. The use of P-rich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome. Some other fractions, however, recovered only after 24 years of restoration. Other inorganic P fractions did not differ among mined, restored, and conserved sites: nonlabile Pi (residual P and P-HCl), labile Pi (Pi-NaHCO3), and moderately labile Pi (Pi-NaOH). Forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil P fractions, highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Deforestation is a global concern due to its problematic consequences, which intensify natural phenomena such as floods. In the past century, Brazil lost large areas of forests due to agricultural and livestock development, mining activities, the construction of hydroelectric plants and the expansion of the urban-industrial sector. The recovery of forests is an alternative to mitigate impacts caused by floods, although it is not known for sure the extent of such mitigation. The objective of this study was to assess the flow behavior of the Velhas River, Southeast Brazil, under different reforestation and deforestation scenarios, through multicriteria analysis and hydrological modeling. The combination of these methods allowed for interesting results, showing that a reforestation in 34.3% of the watershed area would have effects on river flow behavior similar to a reforestation of 9.2%. A scenario of deforestation in 100% of the forest area showed that there would be an increase in flow peaks in the rainiest months.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Java Island has experienced numbers of forest conflict. Consequently, it may contribute to the disturbance of the sustainability of its forest biodiversity and increasing number of local poverty surrounding the forest area. Agroforestry system is known as one of the strategies to mitigate the forest conflict. The system helps the farmers to increase agricultural production, social life, and ecological stability. Local community in Kemuning forest had been implementing coffee-based agroforestry system for a long time, as part of their main income. This system allowed farmers to acces the forest through an intensive interaction between locals and its forest environment. This study aimed to understand the forest conflict mitigation through agroforestry practices in Kemuning forest better, which allegedly become a key factor for the sustainability of the presence of Javan slow lorise. This study builds on the assumption that people frame conflicts on Kemuning forest according to their experiences, expectations, objectives and interests at a specific moment. The basis for our analytical framework is found in theories on framing. In doing so, the study uses the framing analysis theory to identify framing of the conflict by different involved stakeholders. Data were collected in 2018 - 2019 through several techniques such as in depth interview, field observation, and study literatures. Collected data were analyzed descriptively by discussing each finding with framing analysis theory. Findings revealed that conflict in Kemuning forest were triggered by three main issue/problem frames identified as the root causes of the conflicts which are forest security, unfollow the signed contract, and an unequal benefit sharing from the coffee-based agroforestry sector. Other frames: identity, characterization, and conflict management frames were constructed in such a way to reinforce the issue/problem frames. This study also found that related to Javan slow lorise habitat, this coffee-based agroforestry system is the appropriate land use management that provide secure habitat for the sustainability of the presence of the animal within Kemuning forest. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate change and biological invasions are two of the most cited factors that may affect species diversity in the coming decades. Here we used five climate scenarios to investigate the potential distribution of two invasive tree species, Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformis, in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Additionally, we used expansion–contraction maps and maps of potential areas for forest restoration to investigate whether biological invasion could affect restoration efforts. We found A. mangium has a large suitable area in all scenarios (average 268,010.1 km2 ± 25,292.4 SD), while A auriculiformis is confined to a relatively small region (average 13,123.1 km2 ± 361.7 SD). In the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), the suitable area for A. mangium varied from the current scenario of 24.8% of the Atlantic Forest to 26.2% and 25.4% in the years 2050 and 2070, respectively. In the high greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP 8.5), the suitable area contracted to 23.1% and 20.5% in 2050 and 2070, respectively. Approximately 30.8% of the potential area for restoration currently overlaps the suitable area for A. mangium, and this overlap reaches at least 23.8% of the potential areas for restoration in the future scenarios (RCP 8.5 in 2070). A. mangium has a large suitable area in the Atlantic Forest and can become a barrier to restoration efforts in the coming decades. Expansion–contraction maps should be used to establish environmental policies that promote both forest restoration and prevention of biological invasion in suitable areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Canopy bridges are increasingly used to reduce fragmentation in tropical habitats yet monitoring of their impact on the behavior of primates remains limited. The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) is endemic to Java, Indonesia, where the species most often occurs in human-dominated, highly patchy landscapes. Slow lorises cannot leap, are highly arboreally adapted, and are vulnerable on the ground. To increase arboreal connectivity, as part of a long-term conservation project in Cipaganti, West Java, we built and monitored seven slow lorises bridges of two types—waterline or rubber—and monitored their use by seven adult individuals from 2016 to 2017. Motion triggered camera traps collected data for 195 ± standard deviation (SD) 85 days on each bridge. We collected 341.76 hr (179.67 hr before and 162.09 hr after the installation of bridges) of behavioral and home range data via instantaneous sampling every 5 min, and terrestrial behavior (distance and duration of time spent on the ground) via all occurrences sampling. We found that slow lorises used bridges on average 12.9 ± SD 9.7 days after their installment mainly for traveling. Slow lorises showed a trend toward an increase in their home range size (2.57 ha before, 4.11 ha after; p = 0.063) and reduced ground use (5.98 s/hr before, 0.43 s/hr; p = 0.063) after implementation of bridges. Although the number of feeding trees did not change, new feeding trees were included in the home range, and the proportion of data points spent traveling and exploring significantly decreased (p = 0.018). Waterline bridges serve a purpose to irrigate the crops of local farmers who thus help to maintain the bridges, and also ascribe value to the presence of slow lorises. Other endemic mammal species also used the bridges. We advocate the use and monitoring of artificial canopy bridges as an important supplement for habitat connectivity in conservation interventions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, has been cultivated outside its native environment and introduced into humid tropical lowland regions of Asia, South America and Africa over the last few decades. It is a multipurpose tree used in agroforestry, forestry and for restoration of degraded lands. It is also highly invasive in many regions where it has been introduced outside its native range. This paper reviews evidence of its obvious benefits and its negative impacts on biodiversity. Methods: A literature review on Australian acacias and especially on A. mangium was undertaken to highlight both benefits and threats associated with their increasing worldwide use outside their native ranges. Results: Through N2 fixed from the atmosphere, A. mangium improves soil fertility, especially by increasing N status and soil C accretion when introduced to N-limited areas; it thus has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems. No studies have, however, been done to assess the effectiveness of A. mangium in restoring biodiversity of degraded lands. Most Australian acacias have traits that facilitate invasiveness, and 23 species have been recorded as invasive to date. A. mangium has been reported as invasive in Asia, Indonesia, Pacific Islands, Indian Ocean Islands, southern Africa and Brazil. Research on other invasive Australian acacias in several parts of the world has elucidated the types of impacts that are likely in different types of ecosystems and key options for mitigating impacts. Conclusions: A. mangium has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems, but is highly invasive wherever it is planted. Many parts of the world have a large invasion debt for this species. Experience with other invasive acacias around the world suggests a suite of interventions that could be used to reduce invasions and mitigate impacts. Careful risk assessments should be undertaken prior to any new plantings of this species. © The Author(s). 2019.

AB  - We evaluate the effects of “Water and Forest Producers” (PAF), a payment for ecosystem services project, on forest cover outcomes in a watershed serving the Rio de Janeiro region of Brazil. We apply propensity score matching and regression to 81 beneficiary properties on 8848 ha and 398 control properties on 33,748 ha. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for changes in rates of reforestation and deforestation, and the resulting change in forest cover. Over the first 7 years of PAF (2010–2016), our results indicate that the project increased forest cover on participating properties by only 136 ha (95% confidence intervals of 8–265 hectares), or 1.5% relative to our estimate of the counterfactual scenario without PAF. Impacts on forest cover were caused mostly by reduced deforestation rather than reforestation. “Placebo” impact tests estimated using pre-intervention data indicate that our results are robust. The observed forest cover benefit came at the per-hectare cost of $32,963 ($16,917-$560,367) paid mostly with off-site mitigation funds. Semi-structured interviews with PAF beneficiaries suggest that the limited impacts of PAF may be the result of mostly enrolling properties that likely would have remained forested even without the project. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Naturally dense soils have been commonly managed for coffee plantations in Vertentes Fields physiographic zone of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Such dense soils in association with the irregular rainfall in recent years have increased risks for crop productivity. Therefore, management practices aiming at improving subsoil root exploration have been recommended for enhancing absorption of water and nutrient uptake, thus mitigating the edaphic drought process and ensuring the development, productivity, and longevity of the coffee crop. A field experiment was carried out in an area of dense Inceptisols through the planting of the coffee crop to investigate the effect of deep furrowing with additional liming on soil quality indexes and as a function of normalized pore distribution by volume [S*(h)]. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 5 treatments: 40 (conventional soil preparation with furrows at 0.40 m of depth); 60 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.60 m of depth with conventional (60S) and complementary liming application (60C)); 80 (soil preparation with furrow to 0.80 m of depth with conventional (80S) and complementary liming application (80C)). These treatments were compared to an area under native Cerrado vegetation. Undisturbed soil samples were collected at different depths in each treatment. On these samples, water content was measured at different matrix potentials, and physical quality indicators along with the S*(h) were calculated. The results indicated that soil management practices, compared to the native condition, promoted a better distribution of water and air (PAWC, RFC, PMAC and S index) as well S*(h) up to 0.40 m. Below this depth, none of the management practices were able to promote significant improvements (p < 0.05) of these variables in relation to the soil native condition. The 80C treatment had the best air and water availability, with increased of pore size class having functions of drainage and aeration. Moreover, this treatment stood out in comparison to the conventional management (40) for all measured variables, maintaining the adequate conditions of the native area in depth.

AB  - Information on reference values is one of the great demands in ecological restoration, as they enable evaluating the restoration progress and taking adaptive management measures. Here we aimed to: (i) verify whether ecological indicators are influenced by the area of reference ecosystems (mature fragments); (ii) determine reference and comparison values for comparing the restoration progress; and (iii) check how long restoration forests take to reach naturalness values that are like the reference ecosystems (and can therefore be considered restored). We used the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as an object of study and compilated information about 967 secondary, mature and restoration forests in a wide geographical extension. In total, 14 ecological indicators were assessed in a sampling area of 1,928,024 m2. We used simple linear regression to analyze the data and descriptive statistics for creating the reference and comparison values. We found that ecological indicators were not related to the area of mature fragments. Thus, they are useful for monitoring reference ecosystems of different sizes, and more attention can be given to the degree of conservation of the ecosystems. We defined intermediate and final reference values from secondary and mature forests, respectively. We also established comparison values for several restoration stages using data of planting, assisted and unassisted restoration areas. At the same time, we applied the concept of naturalness in restoration and obtained a continuum of naturalness, which was very useful for tracking the restoration progress. With the reference and comparison values determined, restoration practitioners can evaluate their restoration areas by comparing their monitoring results with ours. Moreover, by using the naturalness concept we verified that indicators can have different restoration trajectories. Some indicators reached similar naturalness levels as references from the beginning of restoration, but others required between one and two decades to recover. This study is the first to create evaluation criteria for forest restoration based on a large data set, and we hope that similar studies can be developed in other biomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Active fires are considered to be the key contributor to, and critical consequence of, climate change. Quantifying the occurrence frequency and regional variations in global active fires is significant for assessing carbon cycling, atmospheric chemistry, and postfire ecological effects. Multiscale variations in fire occurrence frequencies have still never been fully investigated despite free access to global active fire products. We analyzed the occurrence frequencies of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires at national, pan-regional (tropics and extratropics) to global scales and at hourly, monthly, and annual scales during 2012–2017. The results revealed that the accumulated occurrence frequencies of VIIRS global active fires were up to 12,193 × 104, yet exhibiting slight fluctuations annually and with respect to the 2014–2016 El Niño event, especially during 2015. About 35.52% of VIIRS active fires occurred from July to September, particularly in August (13.06%), and typically between 10:00 and 13:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT; 42.96%) and especially at 11:00 GMT (17.65%). The total counts conform to a bimodal pattern with peaks in 5°–11°N (18.01%) and 5°–18°S (32.46%), respectively, alongside a unimodal distribution in terms of longitudes between 15°E and 30°E (32.34%). Tropical annual average of active fire (1,496.81 × 104) accounted for 75.83%. Nearly 30% were counted in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, and Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). Fires typically occurred between June (or August) and October (or November) with far below-average rainfall in these countries, while those in MSEA primarily occurred between February and April during the dry season. They were primarily observed between 00:00 and 02:00 GMT, between 12:00 and 14:00 within each Zone Time. We believed that VIIRS global active fires products are useful for developing fire detection algorithms, discriminating occurrence types and ignition causes via correlation analyses with physical geographic elements, and assessment of their potential impacts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate (a) the performance of two modern rice varieties (non-tolerant and tolerant for saline soils) under different fertilizer management options, and (b) assess the yield gap and income increase through proper crop and nutrient management at different levels of soil salinity. Experiments were carried out in moderate and high levels of soil salinity in West Java, Indonesia. A split plot design with three replications was used. The main plots included two rice varieties, Inpari-30 Ciherang sub1 and Inpari-34 (tolerant variety for saline soils), and subplots included eight fertilizer management treatments. Farmer participatory field trials were also established across three levels of soil salinity with four different rice varieties, Sidenuk, Inpari 30, Inpari 34, and Inpari 35, and a fertilizer package consisting of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Under low and moderate soil salinities, Sidenuk and Inpari 30 with recommended practice had higher productivity and economic benefit compared to the saline tolerant rice varieties, Inpari 34 and Inpari 35. However, under high soil salinity, the yields of Inpari 34 and Inpari 35 with recommended practice were 93% higher than farmers’ practice, representing an exploitable yield gap of 1.3 t ha-1 and benefit above fertilizer cost of USD 301 ha−1. The combination of tolerant varieties and improved nutrient management use for rice production can therefore be used as a strategy for improving farmers’ income and livelihoods in coastal areas of Indonesia. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Agroforestry systems can minimize heat stress and improve cattle welfare, but the influence of the forest component in microclimatic changes in the southern Amazon remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the thermal comfort indices in grass monoculture and integrated systems. The three systems were pasture under full sunlight (PFS), integrated (triple-row) livestock-forestry (ILFT), and integrated (single-row) livestock-forestry (ILFs), across four seasons, for two years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We assessed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed. Thermal comfort indices such as temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature-humidity index (BGHI), and radiant thermal load (RTL) were calculated based on microclimate data daily-collected from 8:00 to 16:00. The ILFT mean THI (76.8) was slightly lower than ILFS and PFS. The BGHI and RTL values decreased as shading increased (PFS > ILFs > ILFT). The most challenging heat stress conditions for grazing animals occurred predominately during winter and autumn. In conclusion, the presence of trees in pastures of the southern Amazon improved the microclimate and, consequently, the thermal comfort indices. Agroforestry systems can foster an environment with a more suitable thermal comfort or less restrictive to animal performance, which contribute to mitigating global climate change for forage-livestock systems in Brazilian Amazon. © 2020

AB  - Carbon is continuously being removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and stored in carbon pools (live, dead, and soil carbon) of forest ecosystems. However, carbon stock in dead wood and of trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) between 5 and 10 cm is often not considered in many studies carried out in the Congo Basin Forest. The relationship between tree diversity, life-forms and carbon stocks has received little attention. This study was carried out on the outskirts of Deng Deng National Park (DDNP) to determine tree diversity (dominant families, species richness and Shannon index), assess carbon stocks in the five carbon compartments (living tree, understory, fine roots, dead wood and litter) as well as to analyze the relationship between (1) carbon stocks and tree diversity; and, (2) between carbon stock and life-forms. The Shannon index of trees ≥ 10 cm dbh ranged from 2.6 in riparian forest to 4.3 in secondary forest; and for the tree between 5 and 10 cm, it ranged to 1.56 in riparian forest to 3.68 in the secondary forest. The study site housed 16 species, 7 genera and 3 families which are only found in trees of dbh between 5 and 10 cm. The average total carbon stock of the five compartments varied from 200.1 t ha−1 in forest residues to 439.1 t ha−1 in secondary forest. Dead wood carbon stock varied from 1.2 t ha−1 in riparian forests to 12.51t ha−1 in agroforests. The above ground carbon stocks for trees with diameter between 5 and 10 cm varied from 0.7 t ha−1 in young fallow fields to 5.02 t ha−1 in old secondary forests. This study reveals a low but positive correlation between species richness and total carbon stocks, as well as a significant positive relationship between life-forms and total carbon stocks. The findings highlight the need for more data concerning carbon content of dead wood, carbon of trees ≥ 5 cm < 10 cm dbh and the relationship between carbon stocks and tree diversity from other areas of the Congo Basin for a good understanding of the contribution of tropical forests to climate change mitigation. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Erosive processes can transport sediments containing nutrients, heavy metals and contaminants of organic and inorganic origin into bodies of water, therefore affecting the local ecosystem and the population that benefits from the water sources. In order to better understand the origin of sediment sources and establish mitigation measures, the use of the sediment fingerprinting technique has been highlighted. Thus, the present work had as objective to apply n-alkanes in order to trace and understand the main sources of organic matter in sediments and associate the results with land and soil occupation. The study area is located in the municipality of Rio Negrinho - Brazil, in the Saci river basin. Soil samples were collected and classified according to their use and occupation, as well as and samples of local vegetation to be used as reference. The distribution of n-alkanes in the sediments was compared with the distribution found in the vegetation and soil. Previously, a distribution pattern of n-alkanes had been identified in all major vegetation used to trace the source of organic matter and hence the soil. The concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP)and granulometry were also analyzed in the soil and sediment samples. Indexes between n-alkanes were used and applied to assess the source together with statistical analysis (PCA). In sum, the results showed that the sediments are mainly composed of Pinus taeda reforestation soils, as well as soil from the abandoned roads used to transport the cut trees, while the contribution of autochthonous sediments was found to be minimal. In this way, the fingerprint technique served as an auxiliary tool in order to establish measures for the good management of a river basin, bringing important information about the contributing sources of sediment to water bodies. © 2019

AB  - The viability of the climate pledges made by Brazil at the COP21 in Paris, 2015, heavily depends on the success of the country policies related to forest governance. Particularly, there are high expectations that the enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) will drive large-scale forest recovery and carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the BFC, considering different law implementation settings. Focusing on the Amazon Biome, we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry (≈ 250,000 properties) onto land cover maps to quantify on-site forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery. Similarly, we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for off-site deficit compensation (i.e. via market-based forest certificates trade). Regrowing forests could reduce, on-site, 3.2 Mha of forests deficits, decreasing non-compliance from private properties by 35%. Likewise, forest certificates availability increased by 3.4 Mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations. This means an increase in the forest certificate offer-demand ratio from 0.9 to 2.0. On the one hand, trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a low-cost strategy for compliance with the BFC, a pathway for achieving restoration targets, and an additional source of income for landholders. To meet this potential, it is necessary to better conceptualize second-growth forests, advancing the poor definitions presented by the BFC, and offer an operational basis for their protection. On the other hand, including regrowing forests’ certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected old-growth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions. We highlight that the BFC implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The global demand for palm oil has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen fertilizers on the N dynamics and grain yield in flooded rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation in Brazilian tropical wetland. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with six treatments, as follows: common and protected urea; topdressing application of N doses (30, 70, and 150 kg ha-1); and one control treatment, without N fertilization. Emissions of N2O-N, global warming potential (pGWP), emission factors (EF) for mineral fertilizers, grain yield, emission intensity, nitrate, ammonium, pH, and potential redox were quantified. Gas sampling was carried out in two crop seasons of rice cultivation and in one off-season. During the flooded period of the two crop seasons, N2O fluxes did not exceed 862.41 μg m-2 h-1 N2O-N; in the off-season, the fluxes varied from -52.95 to 274.34 μg m-2 h-1 N2O-N. Consistent emission peaks were observed in soil draining before harvest, when the highest rate of both N sources was used, and also in the control treatment in the off-season. Protected urea does not reduce N2O emissions or EF. Nitrogen increases the grain yield. Protected urea does not have any effect on the pGWP. The concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in the soil are not related to N2O fluxes. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In the sustainable management of Amazonian forests, it is essential to carry out the optimal planning of logging infrastructures to reduce costs and environmental impacts. However, there is a high degree of complexity due to the number of variables involved. Among these infrastructures, wood storage yards are of utmost importance as they directly influence the opening of forest roads and trails. The objective of this research was to evaluate the allocation of wood storage yards through exact solution and metaheuristics in a forest management area. The study area was a native forest under sustainable forest management regime located in the Brazilian Amazon. Three instances were formulated involving 5947 trees and 3172 wood storage yards facilities. We used a binary integer programming model solved by CPLEX and the metaheuristics Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), Tabu Search (TS), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). GAP values increased as a function of instances. Although all metaheuristics obtained significant solutions with shorter processing times, only SA obtained feasible solutions in all executions for all three instances. In general, the metaheuristics were efficient in obtaining feasible solutions faster than CPLEX, which represents the feasibility of the planning of allocation storage large areas, and without significant losses of best-known solution. The SA presented the best performance in the three evaluated instances. Contribution of this study can be highlighted: evaluation of alternative computational methods for planning the allocation of wooden storage yards; evidence was obtained of effectiveness and efficiency of assessed metaheuristics and, the applicability of approximate methods in this problem was evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The decay constant (k) of soil organic carbon can be used in the decision making of soil management practices and it is an indicative of the spatial variability of soil carbon stability, which depends on the interactions of physical, chemical and biological factors within agroecossystem. The aim of this work was to determine the spatial variability structure of soil carbon losses, expressed by the factor k, and its relationship with the soil attributes in sugarcane crops, in the central-south region of Brazil. The experiments were carried out in areas of commercial sugarcane plantations, in the cities of Motuca (MOT), Guariba (GUA) and Pradópolis - SP (PAD), in the State of São Paulo, and Aparecida do Taboado (APT), in Mato Grosso do Sul. The measurements of soil CO2 emission (FCO2) were recorded in the areas of study by the LI-COR system (LI-8100). The multivariate approach indicated that the two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explained around 55% to 68% of the total variability contained in the dataset in the areas studied, respectively. The soil physical attributes showed discriminatory power within PC1 and indicated a contrast between air-filled pore space and soil water content. In PC2, the chemical attributes indicated a joint action of the cations exchange capacity and available phosphorous content. PAD and APT areas presented negative and significant spatial patterns between factor k and PC1. For the spatial patterns between k and PC2 in GUA and APT, values with negative and significant correlations occurred. The results indicate that the soil carbon accumulation potential presented high spatial variability on a small scale; thus, in the same area, there were changes in the spatial patterns of factor k, presenting regions with potential accumulations or sources of carbon in the system of cultivation of raw cane, being able to be carried out the specific management in the same productive area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, the growth of the cultivated area with sweet corn in conventional tillage system in Brazil expanded, although crops can be grown on different residues of cover crops, which improve nutrient cycling and crop productivity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomass production and to quantify the rate of plant residues decomposition of different cover crops, and correlate the results with the production and grain yield of sweet corn in an area located in the Cerrado biome. The experimental design used was randomized blocks with eight treatments: PM-pearl millet; SH-sunn hemp; SG-signal grass; PM + SH; PM + SG; SH + SG; PM+ SH + SG; FW-fallow (spontaneous vegetation), which preceded the cultivation of sweet corn. Fresh biomass (FB) and dry biomass (DB) of the cover crops were evaluated, as well as the rate of plant residue decomposition. Sweet corn productivity, straw and corncob weight, and grain yield were also determined. Pearl millet presented a better performance in FB production, decomposition rate, residue half-life (T1/2 life) in soil, yield, corn cob strawweight and yield of sweet corn. Pearl millet, when mixed with other plants, presented reduced rate of residue decomposition and increased residue T1/2 life. The FW presented the lowest biomass production, with great rate of decomposition and low T1/2 life. Cover crops grown before sweet corn in soils of good fertility did not affect crop agronomic characteristics. Pearl millet is the best cover crop adapted to Cerrado Brazilian climatic conditions to be used in monoculture or in mixtures with other plants. © 2020, Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - The search for suitable adaptation pathways to accommodate for rising sea levels resulting from global climate change is an ongoing concern for many megacities in Southeast Asia and beyond. Addressing already existing challenges resulting from land subsidence and increased occurrence of inland flooding, adaptation can take varied forms and cover widely differing concerns, spaces and time spans. Based on research carried out in the cities of Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines), this paper looks at some key trajectories of current adaptation planning. We argue that the processes of infrastructuring coastal futures in these cities are characterized by different aims and measures that overlap and converge in their material effects but also compete in articulating diverging new claims to the coast. In this perspective, we describe and analyze three main trends of infrastructuring coastal futures: the securitization of coastal futures by way of transforming disaster risk reduction practices and integrating new policy concerns, the greening of coastal spaces in material and operational terms, and finally, the valorization of coastal areas through reclamation, waterfront development and the creation of high-end real estate. Along these three trajectories, coastal adaptation planning becomes a key force that can influence virtually every sector of urban development and governance, and has strong implications for the futures of coastal cities in social and political terms. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

AB  - The reduction in land due to the transfer of functions from agriculture to non-Agriculture, requires stakeholders to intensify the management of dry land and infertile land which was not originally a priority. Therefore, every opportunity for adaptive technology development needs to be utilized as well as possible to encourage increased productivity. This study aims to determine the impact of the use of biochar used in the first cropping maize farming on production and risk of production of the second cropping peanut farming in dry land. The study uses a basic survey method, by determining the location by purposife. The number of samples was 150 people determined by the proportional random sampling method. The data analysis method uses the production function model and the production risk function using the Cobb-Douglass ordinary least square (OLS) method. The results found that the use of biochar in the first cropping maize farming had an impact on the production and risk of the second cropping pattern of peanut production. As a comparison, the factors of production in peanut farming which previously had the effect of reducing production; in the second cropping pattern after maize had an effect on increasing production and reducing production risks include seeds, phosphor fertilizer, potassium fertilizer, pesticide, and labor in the family. Only workers outside the family have the effect of reducing production and increasing risk. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Growing domestic and international ethanol demand is expected to result in increased sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion currently results in land-use changes mainly in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, two severely threatened biodiversity hotspots. This study quantifies potential biodiversity impacts of increased ethanol demand in Brazil in a spatially explicit manner. We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals' species richness up to 2030. Decreased potential species richness due to increased ethanol demand in 2030 was projected for about 19,000 km2 in the Cerrado, 17,000 km2 in the Atlantic Forest, and 7000 km2 in the Pantanal. In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change. This study provides a first indication of biodiversity impacts related to increased ethanol production in Brazil, which is useful for policy makers and ethanol producers aiming to mitigate impacts. Future research should assess the impact of potential mitigation options, such as nature protection, agroforestry, or agricultural intensification. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This commentary examines the challenge of sustainable development in the Amazon, arguing that global efforts to mitigate climate change and current Amazonian policies are clearly inadequate to prevent global warming and deforestation from tipping the forest into a savanna. It analyses the growing climate pressures jeopardising the Amazon's resilience; the erratic Brazilian, Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadorian and Peruvian governance of the forest; and the failure of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) to establish long-term forest conservation policies in the region. The research demonstrates that the 'savannisation hypothesis' is potentially closer to reality than most debates in the social sciences assume and should be considered seriously. The commentary concludes by suggesting possible pathways for preventing the dieback of the Amazon. These are based on three strategic axes: The strengthening of the ACTO, the promotion of a technological revolution in the forest, and a progressive environmental diplomacy by the Amazonian countries.  © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seenfor the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Tropical peatlands play an important role in carbon storage and in water regulation on a landscape level. However, our understanding of their ecology and long-term hydrological dynamics remains limited. Transfer functions, constructed on the basis of biological indicators (proxies) with known ecological preferences, allow us to infer past environmental conditions and serve as a basis for prediction of future changes in peatlands. Here, we use testate amoebae to develop the first species- and functional trait-based transfer functions for the Southeast Asia. This provides a valuable tool for future reconstructions of past hydrological changes in tropical peatlands, their development, and climatic changes. Surface samples for testate amoeba analysis were taken in various biotopes along two transects across the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra. The following environmental characteristics were measured: water table depth (WTD), light intensity, pH, total C and N concentrations. The analysis of the surface samples revealed 145 morphotypes of testate amoebae belonging to 25 genera. A significant fraction of the variance in testate amoeba morphotypes and functional trait composition was explained by WTD and pH. The wide WTD range (0–120 cm) seems more valuable for reconstruction than the extremely short pH gradient (2.5–3.8). Thus, transfer functions were developed only for WTD, based on weighted averaging model for morphotypes and multiple linear regression for functional traits. Both species- and trait-based model have a predictive ability for WTD reconstruction. For traits, the best performance of the model was reached by including five morphological traits: shell width, aperture shape, aperture invagination, shell shape and shell compression. We discuss the ecology of several taxa and highlight the traits, which reflect hydrological changes in this system. Though the hydrological preferences of some species are similar to those in high and middle latitude peatlands, we argue that latitudinal differences in morphospecies composition and variations in environmental relationships of species require the development of region-specific transfer functions. Moreover, our results indicate that ecological preferences of morphotypes within morphospecies also need to be considered and included in future studies. © Copyright © 2020 Krashevska, Tsyganov, Esaulov, Mazei, Hapsari, Saad, Sabiham, Behling and Biagioni.

AB  - Soil changes matter for the global carbon (C) balance although belowground response to land use change is slower and less obvious than that aboveground. Impacts of changes from natural forest to a range of intermediate tree-based land uses (‘agroforestry’) and non-tree agriculture remain contested. Standard C-stock accounting for a fixed sampling depth depends on changes in both Corg concentrations and bulk density, often with opposite effects. Confounding factors that, beyond current vegetation, influence Corg (soil texture, minerology, drainage, elevation and soil pH) may also influence bulk density. Because land use may not be random with respect to inherent soil properties, differences in soil C-stock between land uses can have multiple causes. We compiled and analysed data from six landscapes in Indonesia (volcanic and other mineral soils; Sumatra, Kalimantan; Java, Sulawesi) where chronosequences of forest, various agroforestry systems and open-field agriculture had been sampled. Our data analysis (617 samples within 0−30 cm depth; 8 land use types) showed that a pedotransfer function for effects on Corg of texture, elevation and soil pH reduced the relative standard error of means per land use type, reduced the range (Max–Min)/Avg and led to a more consistent pattern in apparent land use effects. Relative to natural forest reductions in Corg concentration in the 0−30 cm layer (corrected for confounding factors) averaged 8–20 % in degraded forest, complex agroforest, oil palm plantations and older forest plantation plots, and 25–30 % in simple agroforestry, monoculture tree crops and woodlots, or over 40 % in non-tree (mostly cropped) plots. However, calculated C-stock change was small due to an observed increase (up to 30 %) of bulk density relative to that of natural forest. This implies that up to 23 % additional Corg became included in the soil sampling, resulting in a non-negligible bias (underestimate) in estimated soil carbon loss based on internationally agreed C-stock accounting. © 2020

AB  - It is important to know the growth rate of the species to be managed to establish sustainable forest management plans because from this information, it is possible to know which species have reached the minimum commercial size to be collected in future harvests. Manilkara elata (Allemão ex Miq.) Monach is considered one of the most commercialized timber tree species, both inside and outside of Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to model the growth rate and the time required for the trees of this species to reach the minimum cutting diameter defined by the current Brazilian legislation; the analysis was based on the adapted Weibull function with data from 31 years of monitoring in the National Forest of Brazil in Tapajós, Pará, Amazon, Brazil. Three models were proposed to estimate (i) the annual periodic increase in diameter (API), (ii) the future diameter (df) and (iii) the time period in years (t) that each tree would need to reach a future diameter according to the average growth rate of the target species and its forest community. Taken together, the data from the managed and unmanaged areas showed no statistically significant differences between the values observed and estimated by the proposed model when assessed with the Graybill F test. The adapted Weibull model performed well when estimating the annual periodic increment and future tree diameter of the M. elata population. Based on the diameter growth rate, the 5 cm diameter M. elata trees would require 601–781 years to reach the minimum commercial diameter of 50 cm, but the 40–49.9 cm diameter trees that are considered stock for the next harvest would take an average of 20 years to reach this commercial diameter. As the estimated average growth time is shorter than the cutting cycle prescribed by the legislation (25–35 years), it is recommended that forestry treatments that favor longer survival of M. elata individuals be adopted to achieve greater continuous production by primarily considering the long period that young individuals need to reach the cutting diameter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Indigenous Lands in Brazil today resemble a steam locomotive, where the government and the indigenous add wood to the boiler and the conservationists push the brakes. Arranged on the rails and along the way of this locomotive are more than 100 million hectares of the largest tropical forest on the planet. In this article we evaluate the advance of soybean cultivation and fire foci in indigenous lands using remote sensing and discuss the possible effects of a liberation of the economic exploitation in these territories intended by the Brazilian government and requested by the indigenous people themselves. We present that even with the prohibition of economic exploitation on indigenous lands, there are large concentrations of fires in those territories which undermine public policies in Brazil, both in maintaining biodiversity as the assumed climate agreements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The combination of anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis technologies could be a novel energy-biochar production system to maximize energy and nutrient recovery from pulp and paper mill sludge. Herein, the life-cycle energy production and emissions reduction of sludge treatment from a typical pulp and paper mill were investigated, in which alternative uses of biogas for industrial or household application, in different regions of the world, were assessed. The three scenarios considered for different end-uses of biogas are: (A) biogas for vehicle fuel in the transportation sector in Sweden, (B) biogas for heat and electricity in the power sector in Brazil, and (C) biogas for cooking in households in China. The results of Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) show that for all these three scenarios, the use of biogas and pyrolysis gas contributes most to emissions mitigation, while the dewatering and drying processes carried out on the sludge, contribute the most to the environmental emissions. Addition of biochar to the soil, contributes significantly to a reduction in global warming by sequestering carbon in the soil. Compared to scenarios B and C, Scenario A, in which biogas substitutes gasoline in transportation, and heat from combusted pyrolysis gases is used for district heating in Sweden, demonstrates the highest environmental performance for all the evaluated impact categories. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The use of biochar, which is the solid product of biomass pyrolysis, in agricultural soils, has been shown as a strategic solution for building soil carbon stocks and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, biochar amendment might also benefit other key soil processes and services, such as those that are related to water retention, particularly in sandy soils. Here, we conducted an experiment to investigate the potential of biochar to enhance pore size distribution and water retention properties in a tropical sandy soil. Three biochar rates were incorporated (equivalent to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 Mg ha−1) into plastic pots containing a sandy Oxisol sampled from a sugarcane field in Brazil. Undisturbed samples of the mixture were collected at two evaluation times (50 and 150 days) and used to determine water retention curves and other soil physical properties. The results showed that biochar amendment decreased soil bulk density and increased water retention capacity, micropore volume, and available water content. Higher soil water retention in amended soil is associated with the inherent characteristics of biochar (e.g., internal porosity) and potential improvements in soil structure. Microporosity and water retention were enhanced with intermediate biochar rate (12.5 Mg ha−1), instead of the highest rate (25 Mg ha−1) tested. Further studies are needed to validate these results under field conditions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Efforts to reduce deforestation are increasing worldwide through the implementation of climate change mitigation schemes and have recently been promoted as one of the goals of the United Nations’ 2015–2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - The existence of genotype and environment (G x E) interaction causes difficulty in selecting suitable varieties of soybean in an agroforestry system based on kayu putih stands. This study aimed to determine the suitability of adaptive, stable and high yield soybean varieties in an agroforestry system based on kayu putih stands by using GGE-Biplot analysis. The experiment was conducted from May to August 2018 at Menggoran Forest Resort, Playen District, Gunungkidul Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The experiment was conducted using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with five block as replications. The first factor was soil type in Menggoran Forest Resort, consisting of Lithic Haplusterts, Ustic Epiaquerts and Vertic Haplustalfs. The second factor was soybean varieties, consisting of Anjasmoro, Argomulyo, Burangrang, Dering I, Devon I, Gema and Grobogan. The observation was carried out on seed dry weight of soybean per hectare. The data were analyzed using Combined Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with α = 5% and GGE-Biplot. Dering I was the most suitable varieties in an agroforestry system based on kayu putih stands and showed the mean of highest yield of 1.22 tons ha-1. © 2019 Universitas Sebelas Maret.

AB  - The use of sugarcane straw as bioenergy feedstock has been encouraged in recent years due to its potential to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate straw removal causes soil damages, impairing crop development and productivity. Experiments in three sugarcane growing locations (Quatá-SP, Chapadão do Céu-GO, and Quirinópolis-GO) were conducted over 2 years to evaluate soil water dynamics, soil temperature, and sugarcane yield under diverse edaphoclimatic conditions. Straw removal of 0%, 50%, and 100% was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Dielectric water potential sensors were used to record soil water potential (ψ, kPa) and soil temperature (°C) every 6 h at a 0.15-m depth. Sugarcane yields were measured annually using an instrumented truck equipped with load cells. In general, the complete and partial straw removals were detrimental to water storage and therefore to plant available water causing an increase in soil temperature during sprouting and tillering phases, which are extremely important periods for a good crop establishment and, consequently, for yield increase. For the experimental sites presenting high fertility, greater water holding capacity, high sugarcane yield potential, and considering an extended water deficit in early stages of crop development, the complete straw removal resulted in yield losses of up to 16 and 40 Mg ha−1, respectively. For the experimental site presenting low sugarcane yield potential, even with low water deficit at the beginning of crop seasons, straw removal had no significant influence on sugarcane yield in the short term, since straw did not produce enough improvements to soil in order to enable benefits for water retention. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agroforestry practices of the Toraja highland have been developed for along time. This study determined the species diversity and carbon storage potential of the agroforestry at the high land of Toraja. A total of 30 sampling plots, 50 m × 20 m, were selected to represent different altitudes and agroforestry systems. The species diversity was analysed by identifying the constituent species in the agroforest, and biomass and carbon storage potentials of the aboveground parts were measured and analysed. Results revealed that the spatial distribution patterns of plants in the agroforestry systems were random and the selected tree species were generally related to the sites altitude. Meanwhile, the diversity species index was moderate, ranging from 1.87 to 2.14. The mean proportion of the total carbon stored in the aboveground parts for trees was 77.458 tons per ha (97.74%), litter was 1.272 tons/ha (1.61%), and undergrowth was 0.516 tons/ha (0.65%). This study contributes to the adaptation and mitigation of future climate change through the sustainable management of the highland Agroforestry systems. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Important losses of dwarf cashew seedlings during the establishment of orchards in the Brazilian semiarid are related to the relatively short rainy season. This study aimed to evaluate biochar and hydrophilic polymer as soil amendments to increase water retention and reduce plant death in the first year. An experiment was conducted at the Curu Station, Paraipaba, CE, Brazil, using the clone BRS 226. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks, with amounts of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kg of cashew wood biochar and 20, 40, 60, 80 g of hydrophilic polymer applied per pit, as well as a control treatment (no soil amendment). Seedlings were submitted to an irrigation regime to avoid water stress (5 L water seedling-1 when the tensiometer installed at a depth of 0.15 m reached 60 kPa). The variables of plant development number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and canopy diameter were evaluated up to 374 days after transplanting to the field. The analysis of variance showed no treatment effect on plant development. However, minimum water consumption was observed when 29.56 g of hydrophilic polymer was applied per pit, providing 100.0% seedling survival. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola.

AB  - Belowground roles of agroforestry in climate change mitigation (C storage) and adaptation (reduced vulnerability to drought) are less obvious than easy-to-measure aspects aboveground. Documentation on these roles is lacking. We quantified the organic C concentration (Corg) and soil physical properties in a mountainous landscape in Sulawesi (Indonesia) for five land cover types: secondary forest (SF), multistrata cocoa-based agroforestry (CAF) aged 4-5 years (CAF4), 10-12 years (CAF10), 17-34 years (CAF17), and multistrata (mixed fruit and timber) agroforest (MAF45) aged 45-68 years. With four replicate plots per cover type, we measured five pools of C-stock according to IPCC guidelines, soil bulk density (BD), macro porosity (MP), hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and available water capacity of the soil (AWC). The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha-1, the lowest, 74 Mg ha-1, was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha-1. Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, Ks, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg-1) increase of Corg. The restored AWC can support about a week's worth of evapotranspiration without rain, assisting in climate change adaptation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jakabaring and its surrounding which is part of Palembang are also experienced a high level exposure to hazard of inundation, where the area is heavily affected by tides which are mostly swamps, consisting of reclamation and protection swamps that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This study aims to determine the level of risk due to inundation hazards that occur in current conditions and projected conditions through risk assessment with spatial approaches and adaptation strategies needed, The vulnerability parameters that used are exposure (topography, land use, infrastructure), adaptation capacity (drainage), sensitivity (population density, education level, age, gender and poverty). In the baseline condition, Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on moderate level of risk. Meanwhile in the projection condition (2030), Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on high level of risk. The adaptation strategies due to climate change impact that can be carried out are river normalization, drainage normalization, infiltration measure, pumping, green open space, canalization, bio-pore, water retention ponds, multiplying gardens in residential area, roads enhancement, pavement enhancement, polders along rivers, and supervision of swamp regulations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to evaluate the performance of native tree species in the restoration of savanna vegetation by direct seeding, to assess whether weed control and intercropping with native grasses can contribute to the success of this method and to determine whether species performance can be explained by functional traits. Location: Cerrado biome, southeastern Brazil. Old fields abandoned after decades of land use as pasture or croplands, occupied by ruderal plants and invasive grasses. Methods: We established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species native to the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region. We used a factorial design in five blocks, with the following factors: (a) species; (b) weed control and (c) intercropping with native grasses. We evaluated the emergence, survival and growth of plants, and through multiple regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct seeding based on their functional traits. Results: Emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species but with little or no difference between treatments. Growth was compromised by weed competition in all species. Intercropping with native grasses did not decrease weed competition. We found a functional pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding, where survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass, root depth and a greater root:shoot ratio. Conclusion: Weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival, considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding. The success of this method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root system. Characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Pasture degradation in the Brazilian Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America, is a widespread problem that leads to serious environmental consequences. Thus pasture restoration is crucial, not only because of the economic importance of meat production in Brazil, but also for mitigation of soil erosion and the effects of climate change. Furthermore, ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils, highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems. Soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions, thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration. In the present study, we used a barcoded pyrosequencing approach to assess soil bacterial communities under three different conditions: a native cerrado area, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture that was planted with native tree species. In the three study areas, Acidobacteria was dominant phylum (20–38%), followed by Proteobacteria (8–13%), AD3 (4–12%), Verrucomicrobia (3–11%), and Firmicutes (3–8%). However, the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality. The higher abundance of AD3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas. Comparing the two pasture areas, the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period. Proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria showed the opposite trend. Changes in the abundance of main bacterial phyla even in the initial phases of the restoration process, point out for the relevance of microbiological parameters as additional indicators in the monitoring of degradation recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture as well as the associated land clearing are threatening both biodiversity and human wellbeing in tropical areas. Implementing agroforestry systems through a landscape approach has a strong potential for integrating nature conservation objectives into agricultural systems. A key challenge for implementing the landscape approach is that political processes and conservation initiatives operate in ‘silos’, being largely disconnected from farmers and local key agents responsible for tree governance. In this study we brought together different stakeholders in facilitated, structured focus discussions to analyse the role of actor groups in tree governance. We used social network analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse agroforestry governance networks and actor interactions related to information exchange, finance flows, and regulation. The analyses were conducted at national, sub-national and local levels in four countries: Honduras, Peru, Indonesia, and Uganda. Using trees on farms as a boundary object enabled all participants to bridge common interests and illuminate some of the constraints and opportunities of local governance systems while overcoming institutional and ideological barriers. The quantitative results of the social network analysis identify a strong density of actor linkages. Despite this density, results indicate incoherent and fragmented actor networks undermining the support for agroforestry on all levels. Nevertheless, existing processes related to finance, information, and regulation can be better aligned to ensure an effective implementation and mainstreaming of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation. Building social capital among key actors on both national and local levels can reveal a strong potential for adaptive learning processes mainstreaming agroforestry as essential component of “good farming” and integrating incentive systems for a coherent and effective agroforestry governance. We conclude that redirecting both public and private funding towards continuous seed-funding for the facilitation of these integrated learning processes can transform landscape management and at the same time reduce transaction costs. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The 2013-2015 drought in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo exposed the lack of resilience of the regional water supply system, highly dependent on the Cantareira reservoirs. In this paper, inflows to each of the four main Cantareira reservoirs are tested for systematic change. Persistent trends in streamflow, rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration are first evaluated. Streamflow was also tested for step change. Double-mass curves were employed to assess modification in the precipitation-runoff relationship. Subsequently, we used the climate elasticity method and the ABCD model to quantify the relative contribution of climate and human activities into the detected trends. Only Cachoeira and Atibainha sub-basins showed a significant downward trend in streamflow. The results for step change were also significant, and the year of occurrence coincided with breakpoints in precipitation-runoff relationship. For both Cachoeira and Atibainha, human activities had a more significant impact on streamflow reduction than climate variability. Land use and cover maps suggest that the reduction of pasture/abandoned land parallel to an increase in reforestation/ silviculture is behind streamflow reduction. The results highlight the importance of coordinating land-use patterns and water management, as an important contributor beyond any considerations of a changing climate. Implications for better managing regional water resources are discussed. © 2020 IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - São Paulo metropolitan region, like other megacities, has a high index of impervious areas which impacts its hydrology. In the summer, this region is devastated by heavy rainfall events. The main impact of this is the runoff volume produced leading to flash floods, mainly in small basins. Structural flood control measures can be costly, thus, the search for alternatives that mitigate those impacts become relevant for improving the protection, safety, and mobility of the population in the city, during and afterwards the occurrence of rainfall events. In this context, this paper presents some proposals to control the increase of impervious areas. The case study is the Pirajuçara River Basin, which has high potential for preservation and expansion of green areas. The study presents two scenarios: one follows the present condition (Scenario I), the other presents a proposal to control the expansion of impervious rate (Scenario II), following the limits fixed by the present Land Use and Occupation Law. Results show the advantages of the Scenario II in terms of cost and environmental benefits to São Paulo. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the intrapopulation spatial genetic structure (SGS) of a preserved Swietenia macrophylla population in a managed forest in Southwestern Amazon, in Acre state, Brazil, and assess the genetic parameters that underlie the conceptual framework that guides conservation and management strategies. The study was conducted in Annual Production Unit (APU) 3, where 83 adult trees (DBH ≥ 40 cm) were mapped (1650 ha). The diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured and the vascular exchange was sampled. Leaf tissues were collected from 187 juvenile individuals within a radius of 20 m of adults. The population presented high heterozygosity (Ho) for adult (0.767) and juvenile (0.763) individuals, but significantly high allelic richness (R) and significantly lower fixation index (F) in adults (R = 10.3, F = 0.048) than juveniles (R = 9.3, F= 0.119). The F value significantly higher for juveniles, suggesting selection against inbred individuals between juvenile and adult life stages. SGS was detected for adults up to 300 m. Mating was mainly through outcrossing (0.97–1.0), but some crossing occurred among related trees (0.02–0.16) and were correlated (rpm = 0.06–0.22), indicating a mean effective number of pollen donors ranging from 4.5 to 18.2. Pollen dispersal distances reached 3905 m (mean of 1472 m), and mean effective pollination neighbor area of 792 ha. The effective population size (Ne) within family (2.73) was lower than expected for random mating populations. The number of trees (m) required for seed collection was estimated at 55 non-inbreed and not related trees to each other. The core collection consisted of 42 (50.6%) adults across the area. These individuals should be included in seed collection as they represent 100% of the total detected genetic diversity. The inclusion of S. macrophylla on the list of species available for exploitation is not indicated, because the species requires cross breeding for its maintenance and logging reduce the Ne and may negatively impact the pattern of genetic diversity. These will significantly increase the risk of genetic erosion and population extinction due to a lack of adaptive ability. Adults serve as pollen donors that ecologically and genetically contribute to the maintenance of gene flow and Ne. Because it is recognized as a threatened species worldwide, and due to the fact that in areas of natural occurrence the species presents low-density and shows difficulty establishing natural regeneration, we recommend that S. macrophylla be protected from selective logging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current climate change discourses have expressed fear that many coastal communities would be forced to relocate in the face of rising water levels. However, despite the frequency and intensity with which such messages are being broadcasted throughout the world's media, there is little actual evidence of any relocation actually taking place, even though there are a number of past examples of relative sea level rise due to earthquake induced subsidence or groundwater extraction. Thus, in order to better understand the consequences of future sea level rise the authors analysed four instances of land subsidence that have taken place in the 20th and early 21st centuries (namely, adaptation strategies around Tokyo and Jakarta, and the experience of islands on the Danajon bank in the Philippines, and Kepulauan Seribu close to Jakarta). In all cases the inhabitants of densely populated coastal areas remain in place, despite the challenge of living with higher water levels. Adaptation was done through a five-phase process, starting with the construction of rather weak seawalls, which is then followed by the placement of pumps to drain water. Eventually, as the economic and technical capacities of coastal settlements improved, better seawalls were built, which then led to the reclamation of new areas, the elevation of entire districts or the construction of super levees. Thus, while it is clear that sea level rise will pose an additional financial strain on urbanised coastal areas, the authors found no evidence that any major coastal settlements will surrender a significant portion of its land area to the sea, given the range of adaptation options available. Rather, the opposite is true, and evidence indicates that new lines of defence will be built further into the water, effectively meaning that humans will encroach on the sea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil compaction has reduced crop yield under continuous no-tillage systems (NTS), and occasional tillage has been suggested as a mitigating measure. The aim of this study was to suggest a moisture content range ideal for diagnosing and monitoring soil compaction and propose a criterion based on PR for making decisions regarding recommendation of occasional tillage. After 10 years of cultivation under NTS, soil management practices were tested for mitigating soil compaction, combining occasional tillage (subsoiling or chisel plowing) and chemical soil conditioning (limestone or agricultural gypsum). Undisturbed soil samples were collected at three depths, and PR was measured at seven soil matric potentials at 1.5 years after the installation of the experiment. Five PR models were tested in accordance with soil moisture content and validated for each treatment and soil depth. The yields of soybean (2015/2016 and 2017/2018 crop seasons), maize (2016/2017 crop season), common bean (2017 second crop), and wheat (2018 second crop) were evaluated. Occasional tillage with subsoiling or chisel plowing under continuous NTS led to an increase in grain yield in the three subsequent years. An ideal range of soil water content for diagnosis of compaction (IRDC) in a continuous NTS area between the matric potentials of -0.03 and -0.50 MPa, preferentially -0.10 MPa, was suggested, unlike the value of field capacity suggested in the literature. Based on the IRDC, a method was proposed for diagnosis and monitoring of soil compaction in continuous NTS areas exhibiting restricted grain yield for the purpose of making decisions regarding occasional tillage. An example of application of this method was tested and was successful. © 2019

AB  - Indonesia's economy relies heavily on the land-based sector, which results in high deforestation and forest degradation that leads to large emissions from Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF). Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, Indonesia has committed to achieving emission reductions of 29% by 2030 as compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. However, as the largest share comes from LUCF, mitigation efforts in this sector will reduce its production. This study assesses the potential impact of the implementation of the mitigation efforts in the LUCF sector on the economy and environment through the use of a computable general equilibrium model. Two main approaches were introduced to reduce emissions: 1) increasing the crop yield (intensification), which is expected to motivate farmers to use less land and thus, lead to a decrease in deforestation; and 2) encouraging land conservation. Our simulation indicated that intensification alone results in less GDP loss but does not significantly reduce deforestation and emissions from LUCF as farmers will still cultivate the land as usual, and land expansion for commercial plantations, especially palm oil, will continue. Therefore, introducing conservation practices, though costly, may help to protect forest areas and reduce emissions from LUCF. Thus, the simultaneous implementation of intensification and conservation efforts is recommended. To this end, cooperation between the central and regional governments is necessary along with an incentive scheme that encourages farmers to adopt mitigation efforts on their lands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land degradation and rural poverty are widespread in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 × 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha−1) was higher in AFS (26.79 ± 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 ± 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are important ecosystems for Planet Earth, as they store large amounts of carbon and water. A better understanding of the impact of vegetation type and altitude in content, composition, and rate of accumulation of organic matter is key for assessing the current role of such environments. This study evaluated fibric and soluble fractions as well as the lignocellulosic and the isotopic compositions of the peat organic matter from four tropical mountain peatlands located at different altitudes of the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The peatlands are currently under grasslands and forest clusters. Samples of peat under both vegetation types were collected and analyzed for organic matter fractions, cellulose, and lignin (van Soest method), as well as carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Different depths were chosen for radiocarbon dating of selected samples. The organic matter of peatlands currently under grasslands and forest clusters presented differences in soluble fractions, lignocellulosic composition, and δ13C values. Multivariate analyses allowed grouping the peatlands by altitude and vegetation type. The chronological succession of grassland and forest clusters in tropical mountain peatlands was influenced by altitude and was related to paleoclimatic changes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is newest remote sensing technology that is not affected by meteorological conditions. This technology is particularly suitable for use in tropical regions such as Indonesia. In tropical peatland, Indonesia becomes the most important countries for peat areas and carbon stocks. However, this tropical peatland forest had been disturbed by fires, and become a national issue and an international issue. In disaster mitigation, identifying the existence of tropical peatland are needed. But this information is very limited. Therefore, we analysed backscattering value of VV and VH polarisation, and estimated dielectric constant from a dual-polarisation Sentinel-1A in Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia. We also measured dielectric constant at four several types of land use (namely, forest, oil palm, shrubs, and agriculture) along with two types of peat conditions. Results indicated that the dielectric constant decreases as the land use become dry. Results show that the profiles of dielectric constant derived from dual-pol Sentinel-1A images have a high similarity to the direct approach using GPR, with a degree of similarity of 87.24%. The averaged dielectric constants of peat are lower than the peat in subtropics area and ranges between 41 and 68. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Smartphone technology has now penetrated every aspect of modern life. At such high rates of access and utilization, there is today much potential for the development of smartphones as high-performing tools in a number of industries. Traditionally, smartphones have been used as e.g. point-of-care testing devices in developing countries; now a similar approach can be extended to agriculture. This paper assesses the viability of utilizing smartphones in soil analysis. An Android-based smartphone application, in conjunction with commercially available Quantofix® test strips, was employed to analyze 92 soil samples collected across Indonesia. The soils tested encompassed a wide range of different textures (with 13%, 60% and 25% of samples constituting sandy, loamy and clayey soils, respectively), soil organic matter contents (range: 0.8–19.7%) and nutrient concentrations (range for plant-available N: 0.1–137.4 mg kg−1 and P: 1.2 to 64.2 mg kg−1; on dry soil basis). The app utilizes the smartphone as a portable reflectometer, which relates the color of test strips to the concentration of particular nutrients present in the soil medium. Three mobile devices currently available on the market, representing low, mid- and high-end products, were used to test the application. The results obtained via the smartphone were compared against standard methods for determination of extractable nitrate-N and exchangeable phosphorus (Olsen-P) under laboratory conditions. The smartphone-mediated soil analysis was found to have a high degree of agreement with standard methods for nitrate-N determination (87% of samples with nitrate-N differed by less than 10 mg kg−1 from the standard method for the high-end smartphone) but not for phosphorus determination where chemical interferences to test strip colour development were noted. All three mobile devices were shown to be effective as portable reflectometers. However, color perception was found to differ amongst the devices, resulting in a consistent bias between the high-end phone and the remaining appliances. Whereas, it is essential to consider the inter-smartphone variability in readings and environmental factors such as temperature prior to the smartphone-mediated soil analysis, the smartphone-test strip combination might be employed as acceptable screening tool for soil nutrient concentration assessment to enhance crop outcomes, increasing yield, and preventing over-application of inputs, reducing consequent financial and environmental impact. Further enhancements can test the applicability of smartphone-mediated soil analysis in field conditions. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Historically, Brazil's largest source of GHG comes from changes in land use, strongly correlated with deforestation in the Amazon, which can compromise the Reduced Emissions (RE) established in the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution presented in the so-called Agreement from Paris. This study aimed to analyze the Business-as-Usual scenario (BAU scenario), projecting the reduced CO2 emissions from avoided deforestation originating from Land Use Changes in the Brazilian Amazon. Methodology: Estimates of RE values referring to the historical baseline of deforestation from 2006 to 2020. In addition, the projection of the BAU scenario is based on the linear regression model of RE data from 2021 to 2030. Relevance: Studies of deforestation scenarios are fundamental. Especially, this one consists of answering how emissions from deforestation would be configured if nothing changed in the future concerning the usual scenario or BAU scenario. Results: In a pessimistic scenario with high deforestation rates, the BAU Scenario estimates would be: – 121.85 and – 271.31 MtCO2 in 2025 and 2030, respectively. Furthermore, the RE targets for the years: 2020 (154.7 MtCO2), 2025 (719 MtCO2), and 2030 (887 MtCO2) would be overestimated, contradicting the emission mitigation goals. Conclusion: The main conclusion of the study is that in the context of the return of the high rates of deforestation in the Amazon, Brazil still has a great challenge to reach the desired levels of GHG emissions. © 2020 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

AB  - Economic growth has led to tremendous environmental changes including resulted pollution, overexploitation of natural resources (biodiversity), converted land/sea (reclamation) and increasing carbon emissions. How developing countries have ability to manage climate change impacts as committed in international climate agreement such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), UNFCCC, COP 21 and so on, is important to be analyzed. As middle income countries, most developing countries (such as Indonesia) have already dealed with other various issues-political, economic, social, etc-in which most government put their priorities and allocate most of their resources to solve those challenges. It is critical to provide policy framework on adaptation and mitigation of climate change impact to strengthen national resilience. As conceptual paper this study aims to analyse the policy governance that integrate the perspective of social and economic issues to address the impacts of climate change on particular case. By exploring global issues of multi level perspectives, this paper provides several propositions for policy makers to strengthen the key strategic policy in national and local contexts of climate change challenges. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forests and peatlands provide important ecological, climate and socio-economic benefits from the local to the global scale. However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan. Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires. Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions. With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.

AB  - The conservation of tropical forests is recognized as one of the most important challenges for forestry, ecology and politics. Besides strict protection, the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods. Tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries. For tree ring analysis, stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species (Cariniana micrantha, Caryocar villosum and Manilkara huberi) in the upland (terra firme) forests of the Precious Woods Amazon logging company near Itacoatiara, Brazil. Based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones, the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species. Tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter, height and volume growth. The age of the eldest tree, a C. micrantha, was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter. The species’ diameter increments range from 0.20±0.12 cm yr-1 to 0.29±0.08 cm yr-1. At first sight, this is considerably lower than increments reported from other Amazonian or African timber species. Considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents. The interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species, the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances. Management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the Brazilian standards fixed by laws (felling cycle of 25–35 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm). Felling cycles should be increased to 32–51 years and minimum logging diameters to 63–123 cm depending on the species. © 2019 Worbes, Schöngart.

AB  - Background: Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results: In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion: We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The lack of approaches to consider the economic-life cycle environmental performance of cropping systems at experimental stage and the absence of evaluations regarding alternative mango systems are issues addressed in this paper. In this study, an approach for assessing the environmental-economic performance of alternative crop systems, at the experimental stage, is proposed and applied to the mango experiment in Brazil. This approach may be used in other assessments of cropping systems at experimental stage. Methods: The proposed approach encompasses three consecutive evaluations: agronomic and environmental-economic. Initially, the agronomic evaluation statistically compares the yield of alternative cropping systems (treatments in the experiment). Next, a treatment is selected among those with significant better yield and compared to the treatment representing the conventional system, considering environmental and economic criteria. The environmental criteria are the carbon and water footprints of the selected treatments, according to ISO 14067 and 14,046, while the economic is profitability (revenue minus costs with labor and inputs). This approach was applied to evaluate an 8-year mango experiment in the Sao Francisco Valley, Brazil, which intercropped mango trees with two types of plant mixtures (cover crops with different plant mixes), applying two soil management systems (tillage and no-tillage). Results and discussion: The agronomic assessment that statistically compared yields showed that four treatments (T1, T2, T4, and T5) obtained higher yields than those representing the conventional system (T3 and T6). Treatment T4 was selected among the ones with higher yields, and compared with T6 (conventional system), considering the economic and environmental criteria. The economic analysis showed that in 30 years (expected orchard life time), T4 generates a profit that is 44% higher than T6. Regarding the environmental analysis, T4 presents a 16% lower carbon footprint and from 16 to 435% lower water footprint than T6, according to the impact category considered. The scenario where land use changed from an annual crop (melon) to mango orchard further reduced both carbon and water footprints of mangoes produced in T4. Conclusions: The application of the proposed approach to the mango experiment resulted in the reduction of time and data requirements when evaluating the economic-environmental performance of mango alternative cropping systems, allowing the selection of best performing treatment. The assessment of economic-environmental performance showed that treatments with plant mixtures used as cover crops between lines of mango trees, independently of the type of mix used or the soil management applied, enhance the overall performance of mango production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Assessment and monitoring impacts of agricultural systems on soil quality are imperative to establish best management practices and sustainable land use for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity and achieving food and energy security. The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0–0.10, 0.10–0.20, 0.20–0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The forests of Borneo-the third largest island on the planet-sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly ~161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and ~55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact ~1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo's unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their shortterm economic returns. © 2020 Alamgir et al.

AB  - The loss of forest is a leading cause of species extinction, and reforestation is 1 of 2 established interventions for reversing this loss. However, the role of reforestation for biodiversity conservation remains debated, and lacking is an assessment of the potential contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation globally. We conducted a spatial analysis of overlap between 1,550 forest-obligate threatened species’ ranges and land that could be reforested after accounting for socioeconomic and ecological constraints. Reforestation on at least 43% (∼369 million ha) of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates. This is approximately 15% of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur. The greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics, particularly Brazil and Indonesia. Although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation, and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested, our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation. If implemented, reforestation of ∼369 million ha would also contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation, offering a way to achieve multiple sustainability commitments at once. Countries must now work to overcome key barriers (e.g., unclear revenue streams, high transaction costs) to investment in reforestation. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - The degree to which the maintenance of carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity can be jointly achieved in production landscapes is debated. C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha-1) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha-1). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses. Maintaining agroforestry in the landscape allows aboveground C stocks up to 50 Mg ha-1 and reduces biodiversity loss. Agroforestry facilitates climate change mitigation and biodiversity goals to be addressed simultaneously in sustainable production landscapes. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Brazil must restore 12 million hectares of degraded areas by 2030 to meet its goal of the Paris Global Climate Agreement (PGCA). In view of this, the development of mixed planting projects related to carbon-offset in degraded areas is increasing, which demonstrates environmental and social responsibility of corporate and governmental organizations. Despite the great potential of mixed restoration plantations to mitigate climate change, Brazil must overcome major challenges in achieving the ratified goals of the PGCA as well as the effectiveness of its carbon-offset projects. In this context, this study has focused on the evaluation of the growth and survival of tree species in a carbon-offset plantation from a degraded area in southeastern Brazil. Five-hundred-and-nine seedlings (15 forest species) were planted in a completely randomized design. Diameter at the soil level and height of individuals were measured at 40 months. Three individuals of each species were selected and was scaling by a non-destructive method. Timber volume was estimated from the sum of the volume of the sections of the individuals, obtained by the Smalian formula. The average annual carbon increment of the individuals was estimated by the equation adjusted from the Schumacher & Hall model. The potential of carbon-offset of the tested plants was evaluated from the SP and μC analysis. The REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood)/BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) method was used to predict μC values for species ordering with carbon -offset potential. Survival was 47.54% at 40 months. The carbon stock of the planting was 2.60 ± 6.2 Kg C individual−1, and the average annual increase in carbon (AAIC) was 0.78 Kg C individual−1year−1. The AAIC value was lower than the average value stipulated for carbon-offset projects (6.0 Kg CO2 individual−1 year−1). Pioneer species contributed more to carbon storage than non-pioneer species. © 2020

AB  - The accumulation of mismanaged plastic waste in the environment is a serious problem in Indonesia and become a global growing concern. Implementation of mitigation policies to reduce the use of plastics is very urgent, including in reforestation and land rehabilitation programs revealed by many plastics (polybags) used in seedling production for forest planting. Reducing the plastic waste in the planted forest areas can apply some alternative methods that were applied in several regions, such as direct seeding, bare-root seedling and bio-pot seedling. In this paper, application of several methods would be assessed as alternative methods for reforestation and land rehabilitation. Bio-pot seedlings had the highest growth performances in nursery and field test for several tree species, followed by polybag seedling, and direct seeding using seed briquette. However, seedling grown from direct seeding using seed briquette tended to have better root formation, especially in tap root length, tap root biomass and bellow-ground biomass. Direct seeding was estimated twice lower compared to transplanting using polybag or bio-pot seedlings. Furthermore, use of bio-pot seedlings was more effective in rapidly growth and establishing canopy. Direct seeding using seed briquette was a promising alternative technique for land rehabilitation and reforestation, especially for remote areas. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brazil contains the largest volume of freshwater of any nation in the world; however, this essential natural resource is threatened by rapid increases in water consumption and water quality degradation, mainly as a result of anthropogenic pressures. Declining water quality has become an increasingly more significant global concern as economic activities and human populations expand and climate change markedly alters hydrological cycles. Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) pattern have been recognized as a major driver of water quality degradation, however different LULC types and intensities affect water quality in different ways. In addition, the relationships between LULC and water quality may differ for different spatial and temporal scales. The increase in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban sprawl in Brazil highlights the need for water quality protection to ensure immediate human needs and to maintain the quality of water supplies in the long-term. Thus, this manuscript provides an overview of the relationships between LULC and water quality in Brazil, aiming at understanding the effects of different LULC types on water quality, how spatial and temporal scales contribute to these effects, and how such knowledge can improve watershed management and future projections. In general, agriculture and urban areas are the main LULCs responsible for water quality degradation in Brazil. However, although representing a small percentage of the territory, mining has a high impact on water quality. Water quality variables respond differently at different spatial scales, so spatial extent is an important aspect to be considered in studies and management. LULC impacts on water quality also vary seasonally and lag effects mean they take time to occur. Forest restoration can improve water quality and multicriteria evaluation has been applied to identify priority areas for forest restoration and conservation aiming at protecting water quality, but both need further exploration. Watershed modelling has been applied to simulate future impacts of LULC change on water quality, but data availability must be improved to increase the number, locations and duration of studies. Because of the international nature of watersheds and the consistent relationships between land use and water quality in Brazil, we believe our results will also aid water management in other countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders’ livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five biodiverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (−263) to (−496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFSs. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brazil is the world’s leading coffee exporter, contributing billions of dollars to the global food economy. Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by ‘smallholders’, producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by ~0.25 ◦C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country’s mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the important aspects to support the success of REDD+ programme is the availability of a standard methodology and method to estimate carbon stock in forest or agroforestry land, which is recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to describe and discuss a method to estimate the carbon stocks in agroforestry land in Hutumury Village, Ambon. The formulation of allometric equation for nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) is used to predict the aboveground biomass of nutmeg-based agroforestry land. The carbon mass equation model was constructed based on a significant relationship between carbon mass of nutmeg tree and its diameters at breast height and tree height. In order to analyse the biomass content, a destructive sampling technique was used. After felling, dimensional measurement was performed for each tree. The results of the study showed that the equation model for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg tree was allometric equation of Power, i.e., Y = 134.353 * (D**2.424) or ln (Y) = ln (134.353) + (2.424 * ln (D)) with R2 (adj) = 0.977 and standard error (SE) = 0.183. This allometric equation is a local allometric model and much needed to support REDD+ especially in Maluku Province. In addition, aboveground biomass predictors are easy to determine as only stem diameters are required to be measured mainly in dense forests. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study evaluated plants with phytoremediation potential that occur spontaneously in an area of copper mining tailings in Southern of Brazil. Eleven plant species were investigated for heavy metal concentrations in its biomass. All species showed copper concentrations greater than 100 mg kg−1, and seven species highlighted for copper concentrations between 321 and 586 mg kg−1 and these species showed Cr concentrations between 25 and 440 mg kg−1. The species S. viarum Dunal and B. trimera Less were highlighted showing the highest concentrations of Cr (586 mg kg−1) and Cu (440 mg kg−1), respectively. Seven species showed Pb phytoextraction potential and four species showed Cu phytostabilization potential. It was concluded that the investigated species are adapted to low nutritional conditions and showed tolerance to heavy metals, mainly Cu, Pb and Cr in its biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An improved fallow agroforestry practice, that involves planting Acacia auriculiformis trees to accelerate soil fertility recovery, was taught to 306 farmers in Mampu agroforestry zone on the Batéké Plateau in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 1995 to 2001. Our study (1) assessed the principal factors that determined the continued application of this practice by farmers; and (2) identified the benefits and constraints perceived by those farmers who adopted the practice two decades ago. We applied a mixed approach that combined quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation. First, a multiple linear regression model was constructed based on a survey of 121 farmers that adopted the new practice. We subsequently conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 adopters. The regression models identified that the availability of labour, based on the number of household members working in the fields, best explained the continued use of the improved fallow practice (P = 0.0898). In the interviews, revenue from the sale of charcoal and improvement in crop yields were cited as key benefits of improved fallow, while the lack of nurseries for tree production and the problems of access to water were the main drawbacks mentioned by adopters. The study results identify the principal factors influencing the adoption of this practice, as well as the perception of farmers; this information can be used to guide the dissemination of improved fallow practice to other communities on the Batéké Plateau landscape. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Eucalyptus trees in a silvopastoral system on the microclimate and the capacity of that to mitigate the effects of climate change on pasturelands. This study included an open pasture of Piatã palisadegrass and an adjacent pasture that contained both palisadegrass and East-to-West rows of Eucalyptus trees, with 15 m between rows, 2 m between trees within rows. The micrometeorological measurements were collected at several distances from the tree rows and in the open pasture. The silvopastoral system was associated with greater between-row shading when solar declination was high and greater near-tree shading when solar declination was around-22°. Both soil heat flux and temperature were influenced by solar radiation, wind speed, and the ability of tree canopies to reduce radiation losses. Wind speed was consistently lower in the silvopastoral system, owing to the windbreak effect of the Eucalyptus trees. The present study demonstrated that silvopastoral systems can be used to attenuate the effects of climate change, as trees can protect pastureland from intense solar radiation and wind, thereby reducing evapotranspiration and, consequently, improving soil water availability for the understory crop. © 2020, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10–40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil’s policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Human-induced wildfires are one of the greatest threats to tropical forest and are predicted to increase in importance due to altered regimes associated with climate change. Wildfires promote high tree mortality, thus modifying forest structure and composition, and lead to habitat loss and fragmentation. Wildfires may also have effects on the adjacent unburnt areas due to edge influence; conversely, proximity to unburnt forest stands may favor regeneration in the burnt areas. We evaluated wildfire effects on the forest structure of Brazilian Atlantic forest remnants. We established 244 plots along eight 360 m-long transects distributed among three burnt patches, where we measured structural attributes of overstory, understory, and deadwood. The wildfire promoted very high mortality of trees, saplings, and lianas, changing substantially the forest structure. Our analyses showed clear differences between the burnt and unburnt areas but no clear gradients, highlighting the incipient stage of edge influence-related processes. The Neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum was dominant in the burnt areas, which can possibly arrest secondary succession. Our results highlight the importance of wildfires as a menace to Brazilian Atlantic Forests remnants, as well as to tropical rainforests elsewhere - an ever-rising concern in a future of increased fire frequency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a soil moisture retrieval from full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is investigated for sparsely vegetated soil surfaces. An improved retrieval method adapting the variations in vegetation is proposed by incorporating the generalized volume model into the polarimetric two-scale two-component model (PTSTCM). The feasibility of the method, termed as the adaptive PTSTCM, has been tested for tropical peatland sites in Indonesia which exhibit a variety of sparse vegetation cover on soil after land clearing activities. The in situ data were collected in March and August 2017 with the time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe for a total of 18 sample points over 11 regions. The method was applied to ALOS-2 L-band quad-pol SAR data that were acquired simultaneously with field measurements. We compared the results between the proposed adaptive PTSTCM and the original PTSTCM that utilizes specific types of volume model (i.e., randomly, horizontally, and vertically oriented volume models). Scatterplots of estimated versus measured in situ results reveal that the adaptive PTSTCM yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.1vol. % and inversion rate of 35.0 % and 58.5% for March and August data, respectively, which are found to be superior to those of the original PTSTCM. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of increased shadow supply in integrated crop-livestock-forest systems on in vitro embryonic development and physiological parameters related to stress response in Nellore heifers (Bos indicus). For the study, animals (n = 16) were randomly divided into two groups and kept in areas with different afforestation systems, the integrated crop-livestock-forest (ICLF) and the integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system. The microclimate of the ICLF system provided better comfort conditions than ICL. No differences of respiratory rate, rectal temperature, cortisol, T3, T4, oocyte quality, and cleavage rate between the systems were verified. A higher blastocyst rate was observed in the ICLF (p < 0.05). The results demonstrate that Nellore heifers managed in ICLF during summer in Midwest of Brazil showed higher production of in vitro embryos, without typical changes in its physiological parameters. The results observed in the present study indicate that zebu females are able to respond satisfactorily to the intense heat conditions; however, we believe that the long period to which these animals are exposed to these conditions interferes in the oocyte competence and embryo development. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Flooding has been a natural disester in Indonesia and elsewhere. This research is designed to create scenarios and designs conservation to mitigate flooding disaster. Date potential, vulnerability, and duplicated river covering 0.25% of the targeted flooding area were collected and analysed. Five design of conservation, the netural river as control, river normalization, normalization with stone gabion, river straightening, and straightening with gabion stone, and main targeted responses of these five scenarios are river current velocity. Effectiveness scenarios were analysed using Anova and Tukey test. The rasults showed that straightening; with gabion stone was the most effective scenario for flooding mitigation since this was the most effective in increasing river current velocity. This could prevent landslide, accelerate current, overcome flooding, and prevent flooding. Other scenarios such es, normalisation stone gabirn, deadlock alley ditch, canalization, and riparian reclamation are possible implemented. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of −27.6 ± 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD $8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the ∼600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of −16.56 ± 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thelymitra J.R. Forst & G. Forst is a terrestrial orchid genera and mainly distributed in Australia as a center of its diversification. Moreover, Thelymitra javanica Blume is the only species of Thelymitra found in Asia, especially in Indonesia. In Australia and New Zealand, most of Thelymitra species easily found in lowland, whereas, T. javanica in Indonesia preferred to grows near the peaks of mountains around 2,000-3,000 m asl. The high altitude correlated with high light intensity and lower soil nutrients which require specific adaptation of plant to survive. The wide range of adaptation could be due to the presence of genetic variability among populations of Thelymitra. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships of T. javanica in East and Central Java. The genetic variability of Thelymitra was evaluated by molecular approaches, which is preferably utilized to determine the plant taxonomy to establish the taxonomic uncertainties. ITS-nrDNA is a popular DNA marker that widely used in phylogenetic study among various taxa. Sequences were analyses using Maximum Likelihood method with 11 in-group, 6 interspecies out-group of Thelymitra, and 2 intergeneric out-group of Thelymitrinae subtribe. The result showed that ITS-nrDNA sequences of T. javanica have no variation in nucleotide compositions and showing polytomy branch in cladogram. Thelymitra javanica also has a close relationship with Thelymitra longifolia J.R. Forst & G. Forst that are endemic to New Zealand. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven not just by demands from trafftional, rural producers, but also large agriculture and cattle producers, both of whom have put considerable pressure on remaining forests and their watersheds. Monitoring of these watersheds has been a focus of intensive study for the past 20 years and although this work has greatly increased our understanffng, considerable gaps still remain in our ability to provide adequate recommendations for land management and associated public policies. In this study we present a summary of finffngs from these previous results. For small properties, the use of fire to prepare land for cultivation remains controversial, while in large properties, forest conversion to pasture and/or crop production has had a meaningful and adverse effect on water quality. Riparian forest conservation can make a significant fffference in reducing impacts of land-use change. Secondary vegetation can also play an important role in mitigating these impacts. New types of sustainable agricultural production systems, together with incentives such as payments for ecosystem service can also contribute. Continued monitoring of these changes, together with robust sustainable development plans, can help to preserve forest while still addressing the social and economic needs of Amazonian riverine inhabitants. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The management system of soils and nitrogen application can cause impacts on the N2O emissions produced by the agricultural sector. In the establishment of practices of greenhouse gas mitigation for this sector, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil tillage, with and without N fertilization, on N2O emissions from Oxisols under rainfed maize in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The managements were of monoculture maize under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with (1) and without (0) application of N fertilizer (0 and 257 kg N ha−1). From November 2014 to October 2015, gas emissions were measured. The soil and climate variables were measured and related to the N2O fluxes. In the N-fertilized treatments, N2O fluxes were higher (P < 0.01), ranging from −21 μg m−2 h−1 to 548 μg m−2 h−1 N2O under conventional tillage and from −21 μg m−2 h−1 to 380 μg m−2 h−1 N2O under no-tillage, compared with −6 to 93 μg m−2 h−1 N2O from systems without N application. There was a combined effect of mineral N and water-filled pore space for most N2O fluxes. The emission factors of N2O during maize cultivation were lower than the standard factor (1%) established by the International Panel of Climate Change. During the plant crop cycle, 30% less N2O was emitted from the N-fertilized no-tillage than from the conventional tillage. For the total cumulative N2O (crop cycle + fallow), the N2O emissions from NT1 and CT1 were not different, but 10× higher than those from the respective crops without N fertilization. To the emissions per unit of grain yield, CT1 and NT1 emitted 769 and 391 mg N2O kg−1 grain produced, respectively, and NT1 was most efficient in fertilizer-into-product conversion. Under maize cultivation, the soil acted as N2O source, regardless of the management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vegetation stress is a major widespread problem in many countries because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Deforestation and forest degradation phenomena may be caused for several reasons such as infrastructure development, agriculture, collection of wood energy, forest exploitation. Over the last decade, a severe decline in vegetation was observed in the Congo Basin rainforest, the second-largest tropical forest in the world, behind the Amazon. Therefore, actions are required to monitor and detect vegetation stresses to mitigate their negative impacts on human life, wildlife, and plant communities. Vegetation stress can be estimated using three different methods: field measurements, meteorological data, and remote sensing. The present study is mainly focused on satellite remote sensing. The main objective is to develop and test new indices of vegetation-soil dryness based on the surface emissivity. Until now, the problem has been attacked through indices such as the normalized differential vegetation index (or NDVI). The problem of NDVI is that it is a greenness index and is not capable to distinguish bare soil from senescent vegetation, whereas this distinction is important especially when forest degradation followed by eventual regeneration occurs and when dealing with semi-arid regions, where we could have desert sand. We propose to follow the strategy of using surface emissivity (epsilon), which is more closely related to surface type and coverage. By properly using surface emissivity in the infrared we can define a set of channels that are particularly sensitive to bare soil, green, and senescent vegetation. From these emissivity channels, we can derive a suitable emissivity contrast index or ECI, which is sensitive to green vegetation, senescent vegetation, and bare soil, therefore overcoming the NDVI limitation concerning its capability to distinguish bares soil from senescent vegetation. The analysis is performed with CAMEL (Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity for Land) database from 2000 to 2016.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Pará state and the Itacaiúnas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Procambarus clarkii is an important invasive freshwater species whose ecological plasticity allows for its establishment in different kinds of environments; such plasticity is also reflected in its diet with two main consequences: invasion success and impact on native biota. In order to investigate P. clarkii's feeding habits, examine how its diet varies both seasonally and among different demographic groups (reproductive males, non-reproductive males and females) and explore the two consequences mentioned above, we investigated the trophic role of this species in an Atlantic Forest conservation area in the city of São Paulo (Brazil). A total of 540 specimens collected monthly over a year were measured and weighed. Their stomachs were weighed and classified according to the degree of stomach fullness. Stomach contents were examined, and animal and plant matter weighed. Food items were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and the percentage of occurrence of each item was calculated, as well as the diet diversity. Collected data were compared according to seasons and demographic groups through the Analysis of Similarity and Similarity Percentage Analysis. The percentage of animal weight attributed to stomach weight and the degree of fullness of stomachs did not vary significantly among seasons; however, non-reproductive males had significantly less full stomachs. Diet composition was evenly balanced between plant and animal material for both reproductive males and females, while non-reproductive males consumed a lower proportion of animal matter. The diversity in diet composition was high in all seasons and for all demographic groups, although always slightly lower for non-reproductive males. The percentage of occurrence of food items evidenced high consumption of algae and macrophytes throughout the year. It also reflected the seasonal variation of consumed prey, with a shift in consumption of insects and microcrustaceans in spring and summer to decapods and amphibians in fall and winter. The dissimilarity in diet composition was more pronounced among demographic groups than among seasons, being non-reproductive males the most different, with higher ingesting of less evasive prey. Nonetheless, winter differed from other seasons and was the season with least different food composition among demographic groups, indicating a homogenization in diet composition, which might be due to restricted availability of resources. Procambarus clarkii at Jaraguá State Park demonstrated conspicuous dietary variability and flexibility. The occurrence of filled stomachs indicates that food resources are not a constriction for this population. The species presented a diversified and adaptable diet, foraging on algae and macrophytes, and preying on different vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Its trophic plasticity favors successful establishment in invaded areas and summed to its notable voracity, P. clarkii offers a wide, variable and significant interaction in food webs, being able to generate major impacts on native species by its feeding habits. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Reliable data on the contribution of forests to the livelihoods of households in the Congo Basin are not always readily available to governments and decision-makers. This paper assesses the value of forest resources on livelihoods in Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Central Africa Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Data were collected using the Forest Poverty Linkages Toolkit, between 2012 and 2014 on stratified samples of 616 Bantu and indigenous people’s households in 15 villages. The study reveals that forest resources account for 48% to 63% of the total revenue of rural households. In Bantu households, estimates of the gross income from the forest per capita/day range from $US 0.18 to $US 1.3. This value is about double that received by indigenous people except in Congo. Non-cash income is about twice as high as cash income. On average, cash income reaches only about 23% of the World Bank $1.25 a day income level for chronic poverty. However, non-cash income - about twice as high as cash income–mitigates these profound poverty levels to some extent. The paper concludes by considering the importance of the findings for policy-making in Central Africa and the Congo Basin, and more widely. It is suggested that much more data of this kind is need to shape appropriate approaches to sustainable forest management, with a better understanding of the economic security and the livelihood resilience of the chronic poor increasingly kept in mind. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  -                              To accurately quantify tropical peatlands’ contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, and to understand how emissions from peat may change in the future, long-term measurements over seasons and years are needed. Sampling soil respiration over a range of temperature and moisture conditions in the field is valuable for understanding how peat soil emissions may respond to climate change. We collected monthly measurements of total soil respiration, moisture and temperature from forest and smallholder oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our study period, from January 2014 through September 2015, covered wet–dry transitions during 1 year with relatively normal precipitation and one El Niño year. Oil palm plots, with lower water table, had 22% higher total soil respiration (0.71 ± 0.04 g CO                             2                              m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ) than forest plots (0.58 ± 0.04 g CO                             2                              m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ) over the entire monitoring period. However, during the El Niño event in September 2015, despite overall lower water table levels in oil palm plots, total soil respiration was higher in forest (1.24 ± 0.20 g CO                             2                              m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ) than in oil palm (0.90 ± 0.09 g CO                             2                              m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ). Land-use change continues to be an important driver of carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ) emissions from Indonesian peatlands. However, the stronger response of total soil respiration to extreme drought in forest indicates the potential importance of climate regime in determining future net carbon (C) emissions from these ecosystems. Future warming and increased intensity of seasonal drying may increase C emissions from Indonesian peatlands, regardless of land-use.                          © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Emissions of particulate matter from fires associated with land management practices in Indonesia contribute to regional air pollution and mortality. We assess the public health benefits in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore from policies to reduce fires by integrating information on fire emissions, atmospheric transport patterns, and population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We use adjoint sensitivities to relate fire emissions to PM2.5 for a range of meteorological conditions and find that a Business-As-Usual scenario of land use change leads, on average, to 36,000 excess deaths per year into the foreseeable future (the next several decades) across the region. These deaths are largely preventable with fire reduction strategies, such as blocking fires in peatlands, industrial concessions, or protected areas, which reduce the health burden by 66, 45, and 14%, respectively. The effectiveness of these different strategies in mitigating human health impacts depends on the location of fires relative to the population distribution. For example, protecting peatlands through eliminating all fires on such lands would prevent on average 24,000 excess deaths per year into the foreseeable future across the region because, in addition to storing large amounts of fuel, many peatlands are located directly upwind of densely populated areas. We also demonstrate how this framework can be used to prioritize restoration locations for the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency based on their ability to reduce pollution exposure and health burden. This scientific framework is publicly available through an online decision support tool that allows stakeholders to readily determine the public health benefits of different land management strategies. ©2019.

AB  - How relevant is the role of CO2 from harvested wood products (HWPs) for the Brazilian GHG emission balance? The C stocks and CO2 emissions and removals from the HWPs in Brazil during 1900–2016 were evaluated using three methodological approaches: stock-change approach (SCA), production approach (PA), and stock-change of domestic origin (SCDOA). Data from the FAO’s FAOSTAT system on production, import and export of semi-finished products (sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper/paperboard) were analyzed, considering distinct land-use activities: deforestation (D), forest management (FM) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R). Two scenarios to evaluate the effect of HWPs from D were evaluated. The C stock in HWPs in 2016 reached 252 Mt C, by SCA. Contributions to C storage historically were higher from sawnwood, but wood-based panels and paper/paperboard have recently outperformed it. A/R is the major activity responsible for C storage in HWPs. The CO2 removal by HWPs was 521 Mt during 1990–2016, which corresponds to 1.1% of the country’s emissions in the same period. It was concluded that Brazil has become a major producer and wood consumer and that HWPs are allies for a positive C balance and fulfillment of the commitments assumed by the country regarding climate change.

AB  - Tropical forest is highly vulnerable to severe changes in temperature and precipitation, because tree's biomass growth through photosynthesis is strongly related to those climate variables. Utilizing system thinking-based dynamic modelling, this study was mainly aimed to examine the impacts of future climate disturbances on aboveground biomass storage of three tropical tree species groups, namely Shorea spp., Dipterocarpus spp., and Palaquium spp. The final result of the study highlighted that when the dynamic simulation was run following five IPCC's climate change scenarios (Constant year 2000 concentrations, B1, A1T, A2, and A1F1), as well as a scenario of local climate projection for a simulation period of 200 years, the aboveground biomass stored in tree species of Shorea spp., Dipterocarpus spp., and Palaquium spp. will significantly decrease. This finding suggests that negative climate responses should be considered to improve long term sustainable forest management under incoming climate uncertainties. Therefore, several adaptation measures, such as selection of drought-tolerant varieties, assisted natural regeneration of functional species, or even under-planting of genotype of species adapted to expect future climate conditions should start to be considered seriously. © Penerbit UMT.

AB  - We used a hybrid optimization-agent-based model to simulate REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in combination with conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) payment scenarios to farm households in the old deforestation frontier of Rondônia, Brazil. Payments varied from $5 to $30 per ton of net CO2 either not emitted or removed from the atmosphere relative to a baseline scenario. The impacts of REDD+ were assessed as changes in land use/cover, net CO2 emissions, program costs, community welfare, and agricultural production. Our results suggest that interventions aimed at zero gross deforestation would require unrealistically large annual disbursements. In contrast, zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at approximately two-thirds the cost with reduced impacts on food production. Overall, simulated payments increased inequality among households, which conflicts with desired REDD+ outcomes. Results suggest that REDD+ might be more successful solely as a climate change mitigation mechanism as opposed to a complex multi-objective development program. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate is one of the main factors that affect plant behavior. The phenology of Guarea macrophylla Vahl, which is a small tree used for reforestation of degraded areas, was monitored for 18 months in a riparian forest at the Schmidt Stream, Campo Bom, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Vegetative (leaf fall and leaf flushing) and reproductive events were observed, with the latter divided into flowering (flower buds and anthesis) and fruiting (unripe, ripening and ripe fruit). Phenological events were related to temperature, photoperiod and precipitation and their seasonality was verified by circular statistical analysis. Vegetative phenophases were continuous; they were not related to climate factors and presented low intensity, emphasizing the perennial aspect of the species. Flowering occurred during spring and summer. Both flower buds and anthesis were related to temperature and photoperiod. Fruiting was constant and went through all stages of development. Unripe fruits developed during the months with the lowest photoperiod and ripen more intensely in winter, on colder days. Ripe fruit became available for dispersal in spring, in times of longer photoperiod and higher temperatures. Except for leaf fall, all other phenological events showed seasonality in their manifestation. The one-month difference between the onsets of the flowering phases observed in this study indicated that local climate changes induced the early occurrence of this phenophase. © 2018, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Rhodolith beds, like many other marine ecosystems, are affected by climate change that is causing an increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme high temperature events (heat waves). Unfortunately, this does not represent the sole peril for these communities, as coastal urbanization in conjunction with altered precipitation patterns can increase terrestrial-derived nutrient input. In Brazil, rhodolith beds are among the most extensive coastal benthic ecosystems, but despite their vast distribution and great ecological and economic importance, studies on the productivity of these communities and the impact of changing environmental conditions are almost non-existent. This study addressed the individual and combined effects of increases in temperature and nutrient concentration on the physiological performance of two widely distributed rhodolith species, Lithothamnion crispatum and Melyvonnea erubescens. The results showed species-specific responses in net photosynthetic performance, with no response in L. crispatum, while M. erubescens responded negatively to both increase in temperature and nutrients. In contrast, calcification in both species showed a significant decline at high temperature. No interactive effects were found between temperature and nutrients, yet their combined negative effects were additive, resulting in negative daily-integrated net productivity and a large decline in daily carbonate production in both species. This has strong implications for rhodolith bed primary productivity and carbonate production, as heat waves may potentially cause a strong decline in carbonate production (ca. 50% loss), accompanied by a severe drop in primary productivity that will be even more pronounced under high-nutrient conditions. Also, the species-specific responses to changes in temperature and nutrient concentration suggest that the magnitude of impact of these factors on rhodolith bed productivity will depend on the species dominating the community and may finally result in changes in rhodolith community composition. © 2019

AB  - Mangroves of the semiarid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil are being rapidly converted to shrimp pond aquaculture. To determine ecosystem carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from this widespread land use, we measured carbon stocks of eight mangrove forests and three shrimp ponds in the Acaraú and Jaguaribe watersheds in Ceará state, Brazil. The shrimp ponds were paired with adjacent intact mangroves to ascertain carbon losses and potential emissions from land conversion. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock of mangroves in this semiarid tropical landscape was 413 ± 94 Mg C/ha. There were highly significant differences in the ecosystem carbon stocks between the two sampled estuaries suggesting caution when extrapolating carbon stock across different estuaries even in the same landscape. Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds resulted in losses of 58%–82% of the ecosystem carbon stocks. The mean potential emissions arising from mangrove conversion to shrimp ponds was 1,390 Mg CO2e/ha. Carbon losses were largely from soils which accounted for 81% of the total emission. Losses from soils >100 cm in depth accounted for 33% of the total ecosystem carbon loss. Soil carbon losses from shrimp pond conversion are equivalent to about 182 years of soil carbon accumulation. Losses from mangrove conversion are about 10-fold greater than emissions from conversion of upland tropical dry forest in the Brazilian Caatinga underscoring the potential value for their inclusion in climate change mitigation activities. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The coffee leaf miner (CLM) Leucoptera coffeella has a wide distribution and causes significant losses in coffee plantations (Coffea spp.) in Brazil. Its occurrence can be mitigated in intercropped systems, with the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) adapting well to the consortium, while also providing extra income to the producer. We aimed to determine whether the afforestation influences the microclimate and affects the leaf miner incidence and its predation by wasp in coffee plants intercropped with rubber trees. The study was undertaken in state of Paraná, Brazil, using coffee plants intercropped with rubber trees planted in double rows (alleys) spaced at 13, 16 and 22 m between alleys, and compared to sole cropping coffee plots. From January 2008 to November 2010, the presence of CLM’s lesions including those with signs of wasp predation was monitored in coffee plants intercropped with rubber trees and in the non-consorted coffee. A higher CLM’s incidence was verified in monoculture coffee plots, while coffee plants located under and two meters away from rubber trees had the lowest incidences. CLM’s incidence in intercropping system got higher as it increased distance from the trees. The number of lesions with signs of predation by wasps was positively correlated with the number CLM’s lesions, indicating a density-dependent predator-prey relationship. The coffee plants intercropped with alley rubber trees reduce the CLM’s occurrence and can be a management’s tactic for this economically important pest. © 2018, Editora UFLA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Attention to tenure is a fundamental step in preparation for REDD+ implementation. Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010–2012 and 2013–2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents’ efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and “business-as-usual” interests. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Forestry and peat land including land-based is one of the critical sectors in the inventory of CO2 emissions and mitigation efforts of climate change. The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon emission source as well as the predicted 2carbon dioxide emissions from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely dry land agriculture (109.65%), paddy field (16.23%) and estate plantation (15.11%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60%), secondary mangrove forest (9.03%), secondary swamp forest (33.98%), and the largest one in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96%). The results indicated that North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that contributed 2carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8%, changing from forest areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared 30.6% and estate plantation of 22.4%. Mitigation actions to reduce carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land, rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest, forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to reduce 15% for forestry and 18% for peat land, respectively. This data is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North Sumatra. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Indonesia's marine ecosystems form a fundamental part of the world's natural heritage, representing a global maxima of marine biodiversity and supporting the world's second largest production of seafood. Seagrasses are a key part of that support. In the absence of empirical data we present evidence from expert opinions as to the state of Indonesia's seagrass ecosystems, their support for ecosystem services, with a focus on fisheries, and the damaging activities that threaten their existence. We further draw on expert opinion to elicit potential solutions to prevent further loss. Seagrasses and the ecosystem services they support across the Indonesian archipelago are in a critical state of decline. Declining seagrass health is the result of shifting environmental conditions due largely to coastal development, land reclamation, and deforestation, as well as seaweed farming, overfishing and garbage dumping. In particular, we also describe the declining state of the fisheries resources that seagrass meadows support. The perilous state of Indonesia's seagrasses will compromise their resilience to climate change and result in a loss of their high ecosystem service value. Community supported management initiatives provide one mechanism for seagrass protection.

AB  - The long-term response of ancient societies to climate change has been a matter of global debate. Until recently, the lack of integrative studies using archaeological, palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological data prevented an evaluation of the relationship between climate change, distinct subsistence strategies and cultural transformations across the largest rainforest of the world, Amazonia. Here we review the most relevant cultural changes seen in the archaeological record of six different regions within Greater Amazonia during late pre-Columbian times. We compare the chronology of those cultural transitions with high-resolution regional palaeoclimate proxies, showing that, while some societies faced major reorganization during periods of climate change, others were unaffected and even flourished. We propose that societies with intensive, specialized land-use systems were vulnerable to transient climate change. In contrast, land-use systems that relied primarily on polyculture agroforestry, resulting in the formation of enriched forests and fertile Amazonian dark earth in the long term, were more resilient to climate change. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Examples of large-scale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries, and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets. Given the increasing investment of time, effort, and money in restoration, there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness. Some countries are already conducting monitoring programs, but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown. Restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties, such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation. With the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects, the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs. The aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes. The São Paulo Forest Restoration Program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model. This paper presents the conceptual model, emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs. Based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review, the resulting Forest Management Decisions Support System (FMDSS) embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an auto-updatable knowledge base. The result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the FMDSS. The restoration of degraded areas in a case with >40,000 rural properties serves as the case study. Although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ, the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations. Additionally, conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes, supported by an auto-updatable knowledge base, mitigate the risk of failures, mainly when the comprehensive gathering of well-established references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  -                              It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000 Mg C ha                             −1                             , but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20 Mg C ha                             −1                              year                             −1                             . These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.                          © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Although still the largest expanse of tropical rainforests in the world, the Amazon is suffering a declining capacity to deliver ecosystem services, to which the widespread use of fire is one of the main contributing factors. Even if fires directly affect the timber sector, most current logging practices often tend to increase rather than mitigate the problem. We argue that in order to involve the timber sector in fire mitigation policies in the Amazon it is crucial to assess the economic impact of fire on the sector. This paper describes EcoFire (Economic Cost of Fire), a spatially explicit model for valuing the economic losses to sustainable timber harvest operations in the Brazilian Amazon as a result of fire. To conduct this analysis, we have integrated a set of models that simulate the synergy between logging and fire spread and intensity. Our results show that fire affects roughly 2% of the timber production areas that would be harvested between 2012 and 2041. In burnt areas, fire causes losses on average of US$39 ± 2 ha/year (equivalent annual annuity), which represents a loss of 0.8% of expected rents. Yet losses can reach up to US$183 ± 30 ha/year in areas hit by recurrent fires that are near milling centres. The results indicate that some of the municipalities that are likely to accumulate most economic losses due to fire do not yet have local-level fire mitigation programmes. We therefore conclude that spatially explicit valuations of the economic impact of fire can pinpoint priorities to better target fire action plans as well as to engage local actors in integrated fire management practices.

AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystems are important elements for addressing national and global socioeconomic and environmental crises, since they provide new development opportunities, for example, as source of job and income creation, and reduction in poverty and socioeconomic inequity. Brazilian biological diversity is also expressed in its immense cultural diversity, with a great variety of knowledge holders. These peoples possess vast knowledge on agrobiodiversity, fishing, fire management, natural medicine, among others of commercial, cultural and spiritual value. The main conclusions of this Summary for Police Makers is that land use changes and climate changes have been-and will continue to be throughout this century-the main drivers that result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country. Political interventions at different levels (from local to national, from public to private) and the enforcement of existing laws (regulatory mechanisms and incentives) are required to cope with the mitigation of the negative impacts of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss. Brazil has already a wide variety of policy instruments and socioenvironmental governance options, as well as global commitments (ODS, Aich Targets, Paris Agreement) related to the objective of a sustainable future. However, inefficient management control or lack of incentive to comply with the rules pose risks to consolidating the path to this future. The country has strong and capable institutions, but infrastructural problems, slow processes, inefficient measurements and judicial, social and ecological conflicts obstruct a proficient performance. There is a lack of communication between science and society which needs to be improved by establishing an effective flow that makes communication inclusive and representative, reaching public and private decision makers. Permanent efforts to integrate Science and policy knowledges are desirable to build confidence between policy makers and researchers. © 2019, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - Forest conservation contributes to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation. To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures—mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation—in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genes—the basic constituent of biodiversity. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Cameroon like other developing countries is developing approaches to respond to national and global climate change adaptation and mitigation commitments. Sufficient information on the interplay between sector policies and the causes, impacts and response to climate change is relevant for developing sustainable climate change response plans. Using the agriculture sector as a case, this paper examines this interplay in the context of the humid forest zone (HFZ) of Cameroon. Drawing on secondary information from agriculture sector strategies, forest cover change, climate vulnerability and agriculture systems in the HFZ, we found that: (i) the objectives of agriculture expansion and avoided deforestation and forest degradation are at cross-roads; (ii) agriculture as a livelihood strategy is vulnerable to climate variability and change; (iii) strengthening agriculture production systems technically, materially and financially are main suggestions for climate resilient and low carbon emission agriculture practices. We highlight barriers that need to be addressed for the agriculture intensification mechanism, i.e. the agriculture research and extension services in Cameroon to respond to the needs of adaptation and carbon emission reductions from avoided deforestation. These barriers and others would be addressed if their financial, technology and capacity building needs are carefully evaluated as Cameroon mobilizes resources for the implementation of its National Determined Contributions. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Large areas of deforested and degraded land, particularly degraded peatlands, need a viable long-term solution for restoration, ideally one that ensures energy security without compromising food security or biodiversity conversation. To address a knowledge gap on the most adaptive bioenergy crop(s) for degraded lands, this research project assessed the survival and growth performance of potential bioenergy crops to restore burned and degraded peatlands. Our methodology compared the bioenergy species with the potential to survive in extreme environments, i.e., gamal [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], kaliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner), kemiri sunan [Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) Airy Shaw], and nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). Observed parameters are plant survival rates, tree height, and circular stem growth. The experiment was conducted between March 2016 to February 2017 in a two-hectare demonstration plot on burned and degraded peatland in Buntoi village, Pulang Pisau, Central Kalimantan province. Using a split plot design, two treatments were given to each species, i.e., monoculture plantation and agroforestry (intercropped with Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.); with each treatment, the species were replicated on two separate plots. Results indicate that nyamplung is the most adoptable species followed by kemiri sunan, however both species performed very well under agroforestry treatment when compared with monoculture. Further study is needed to assess the productivity and associate biofuel yield. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - With the loss and fragmentation of tropical forests, the survival of primates depends on their ability to adapt to human-introduced modifications in their habitat. Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding, gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the adaptability of different lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cultivars grown in no-tillage on straw of ruzi grass (Urochloa ruziziensis), as well as its effects on soil temperature and weed control, in successive cultivations in the summer. The treatments were carried out in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates, in a split-plot arrangement (2×4), in which soil management (no-tillage on ruzi grass and convention tillage) was the main plot, and the different crisphead lettuce cultivars (Amanda, Solaris, Vanda, and Vera), the subplots. No difference was observed between cultivars for soil management. No-tillage reduced the soil temperature by up to 3.7°C and weed density by 3.7 times, in comparison with conventional tillage. Ruzi grass promoted a greater bed conservation. In comparison to with conventional tillage, the no-tillage management of lettuce cultivated on ruzi grass straw resulted in a lower yield in the first crop due to excess straw; in a similar yield in the second crop; and in a greater yield in the third crop. Lettuce cultivated on ruzi grass straw in no-tillage management results in a greater sustainability, in comparison with conventional tillage, in three successive plantings. © 2018, Embrapa.; O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a adaptabilidade de cultivares de alface (Lactuca sativa) ao plantio direto sobre palhada de capim-congo (Urochloa ruziziensis), assim como seu efeito sobre a temperatura do solo e o controle de plantas daninhas, em cultivos sucessivos no verão. Os tratamentos foram dispostos no delineamento experimental de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições, em arranjo de parcelas subdivididas (2×4), em que os manejos do solo (plantio direto sobre capim-congo e plantio convencional) constituíram a parcela principal, e as diferentes cultivares de alface tipo crespa (Amanda, Solaris, Vanda e Vera), as subparcelas. As cultivares não diferiram entre si quanto ao manejo do solo. O plantio direto reduziu a temperatura do solo em até 3,7°C, e a densidade de plantas daninhas em 3,7 vezes, em comparação ao plantio convencional. O capim-congo promoveu a maior conservação dos canteiros. Em comparação ao plantio convencional, o plantio direto de alface sobre palhada de capim-congo resultou em produtividade menor no primeiro cultivo, em razão do excesso de palha; em produtividade semelhante, no segundo cultivo; e produtividade superior, no terceiro cultivo. O cultivo de alface em plantio direto sobre palhada de capimcongo resulta em maior sustentabilidade, em comparação ao plantio convencional, ao longo de três cultivos sucessivos. © 2018, Embrapa.

AB  - In response to a strong El Niño, fires in Indonesia during September and October 2015 released a large amount of carbon dioxide and created a massive regional smoke cloud that severely degraded air quality in many urban centers across Southeast Asia. Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Niño-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (14C) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm). The Δ14C of fire-emitted aerosol was −76 ± 51, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 ± 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (∼85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Niño events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Land occupation and management systems have defined fire regimes and landscapes for millennia. The savanna biome is responsible for 86% of all fire events, contributes to 10% of the total carbon emissions annually and is home to 10% of the human population. European colonization has been associated with the implementation of fire suppression policies in many tropical savanna regions, markedly disrupting traditional fire management practices and transforming ecosystems. In this paper we assess savanna burning approaches from pre-colonial to contemporary eras in three regions: northern Australia, southern Africa and Brazil. In these regions, fire suppression policies have led to (i) conflicts between government authorities and local communities; (ii) frequent late dry season wildfires and/or (iii) woody encroachment. Such consequences are facilitating changes to fire management policies, including recognition and incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary community-based adaptive savanna fire management. Such programs include implementation of prescribed early dry season fires and, in some regions, generating income opportunities for rural and traditional communities through the reduction of late dry season wildfires and associated greenhouse gas emissions. We present a brief history of fire management policies in these three important savanna regions, and identify ongoing challenges for implementation of culturally and ecologically sustainable fire management policies. © 2018

AB  - Institutional community-based mangrove management as an alternative to sustainable management of mangrove forests. This study aims to analyze which factors from the institution most play a role in guiding the community in managing mangrove forest resources in relation to forest management units (KPH). To determine the local institutional model that has great potential with collective action with the power of local regulation in the management of common resources needed in sustainable management. Institutional analysis and development framework are used to investigate the performance of each of these institutional patterns. Understanding the conditions under which these local institutions collaborate or compete with each other and with new institutions working at the local level will increase the chances for sustainable forest management in areas where these institutions share responsibility. Of the three models of mangrove management institutions, namely the community institution of PusongKapal Village (DPK), the community institution of PusongTelagaTujoh Village (DPTT), and the Community Forestry (HKm) BinaMufakat institution where the analysis shows that the community institutions of PusongKapal Village (DPK) are more flexible as an alternative form of community-based mangrove management institutions, because this institution is able to adapt to the changing social and environmental conditions that continue to occur, the collaboration of management with the government, and the recognition of community rights in the use of mangrove forests. KPH as the management authority at the site level has guaranteed the upholding of the rights of the DPK community as the manager of mangrove forests so that the bundle of rights and incentives obtained in the management of mangrove resources by DPK communities becomes strong. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - Large uncertainties in the susceptibility of tropical forest productivity to precipitation changes hamper climate change projection. Interactions between the availabilities of water and phosphorus could theoretically either increase or decrease the susceptibility of tropical gas exchange to variation of precipitation. The inclusion of phosphorus-water interactions in a land surface model reduces the coefficient of variance, a measure of variability, of biweekly gross primary productivity by a factor of 1.5–2.3 at three tropical forest sites in Brazil, bringing it closer to estimates from eddy covariance measurements and remote sensing. Soil drought conditions are attenuated due to 8–30% lower water consumption during wet periods in presence of phosphorus limitation. When soils are dry, plant phosphorus acquisition is impaired by reduced ion mobility, despite an increase in net phosphorus mineralization. We conclude that water-phosphorus interactions cannot be omitted in analysis of the resilience of tropical ecosystems to precipitation changes. ©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Mangrove forest plays a critical role in the context of climate change in tropical and subtropical regions. The present study analyzed the deforestation and reforestation from land-use and land-cover changes from 1990, 2000, 2009 and 2015 in North Sumatran mangrove forest, Indonesia. The land-use/land-cover consists of thirteen classes namely, primary mangrove forest, secondary mangrove forest, shrub, swamp shrub, swamp, settlement, paddy field, oil palm plantation, aquaculture, dry land farming, mixed dry land farming, mining, and barren land. Results showed that primary mangrove forests significantly decreased 61.21% from 1990 to 2015, mostly deforestation was derived from 1990 to 2000 to be secondary mangrove forest and swamp shrub. During 25 years observed, no reforestation was noted in the primary mangrove forest. Similarly, secondary mangrove forest had been degraded from 56,128.75 ha in 1990 to only 35,768.48 ha in 2015. Drivers of deforestation found in secondary mangrove forests were aquaculture (43.32%), barren land (32.56%), swamp shrub (10.88%), and oil palm plantation (5.17%). On the other hand, reforested activity was occurred only 701.83 ha from 1990 to 2015, while the nonforest use has been increased. These data are likely to contribute towards coastal management planning, conservation, and rehabilitation of degraded mangrove forests. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m-3). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha-1 range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for- ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Selective logging is one of the most prominent land uses in tropical forests and although it involves harvesting a limited number of trees, the impact on forest structure, composition and aboveground biomass can be significant. Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after ∼13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography (‘hummocks’ and ‘hollows’) that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  -                              Carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ) emissions from Southeast Asia peatlands are contributing substantially to global anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. Peatland emissions associated with land-use change, and fires are closely related to changes in the water table level. Remote sensing is a powerful tool that is potentially useful for estimating peat CO                             2                              emissions over large spatial and temporal scales. We related ground measurements of total soil respiration and water table depth collected over 19 months in an Indonesian peatland to remotely sensed gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomoly (TWSA) data. GRACE TWSA can be used to predict changes in water storage on land. We combined ground observations from undrained forest and drained smallholder oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan to produce a representation of the peatland landscape in one 0.5° × 0.5° GRACE grid cell. In both ecosystem types, total soil respiration increased with increasing water table depth. Across the landscape grid, monthly changes in water table depth were significantly related to fluctuations in GRACE TWSA. GRACE TWSA explained 76% of variation in water table depth and 75% of variation in total soil respiration measured on the ground. By facilitating regular sampling across broad spatial scales that captures essential variation in a major driver of soil respiration and peat fires, our approach could improve information available to decision makers to monitor changes in water table depth and peat CO                             2                              emissions. This would enable measures better targeted in space and time to more effectively mitigate CO                             2                              emissions from tropical peat drainage and fires. Testing over larger regions is needed to operationalize this exploratory approach.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to present and to apply a method based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which was used to assess the environmental performance of hybrid rainwater-greywater systems in residential buildings. The method was applied in a case study in single-family residences in southern Brazil. The environmental impacts of two scenarios were compared: a house with a decentralized hybrid rainwater-greywater system and the same house with a conventional centralized water system. SimaPro software was used for environmental impact analysis and ReCiPe was used as an assessment tool. The average potential for potable water savings through the implementation of the hybrid rainwater-greywater system was 41.9%, the potential for domestic sewage reduction was 40% and the total energy consumption reduction in comparison to the conventional system scenario was 36.1%. The most significant environmental impacts in the assessment of the life cycle were related to the operational phase. The energy savings in the operation phase is essential to minimize the impacts observed and to maximize the sustainability and potential benefits. The findings of this study indicate that the scenario with hybrid rainwater-greywater system represents the most environmentally favourable option in single-family residences. The method is easy to adapt to different regions and can support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance of existing and new hybrid rainwater-greywater systems. It may also contribute to the recommendation of potential environmental mitigation measures and to the development of specific public policies to encourage the residential use of alternative water sources. © 2019

AB  - Protecting aboveground carbon stocks in tropical forests is essential for mitigating global climate change and is assumed to simultaneously conserve biodiversity. Although the relationship between tree diversity and carbon stocks is generally positive, the relationship remains unclear for consumers or decomposers. We assessed this relationship for multiple trophic levels across the tree of life (10 organismal groups, 3 kingdoms) in lowland rainforests of the Congo Basin. Comparisons across regrowth and old-growth forests evinced the expected positive relationship for trees, but not for other organismal groups. Moreover, differences in species composition between forests increased with difference in carbon stock. These variable associations across the tree of life contradict the implicit assumption that maximum co-benefits to biodiversity are associated with conservation of forests with the highest carbon storage. Initiatives targeting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation should include both old-growth and regenerating forests to optimally benefit biodiversity and carbon storage. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The Indonesian government recently confirmed its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to mitigate global climate change. A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities’ benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning. The LUCES model could be an ex ante tool to facilitate such fine-tuning and help the Indonesian government achieve its INDC goals as part of a wider sustainable development policy. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The zone of Losari Coast is an icon of Makassar city, however increase activity of surrounding communities causes a decrease in the water quality. Meiofauna is an effective benthic organism used as an indicator of water quality. This study assessed the meiofauna abundance and physical-chemical parameters as water quality indicator in the Losari Coast, Makassar. The sampling method in this study was purposive sampling. The resuts showed that total meiofauna abundance identified was 66791 indv.m-2, composed of 12 phylum and 91 species or genera. Stations at the estuary of the Jeneberang and Tallo River are two sites with high level of abundance, this condition allows presence of organic contaminants triggers the high growth of meiofauna in these locations. Dissolved Oxygen is below its supposed level in waters. Acidity, phosphate and nitrate content at some of research stations exceed the threshold of their allowed presence in waters set by Indonesia government. Ostracoda, oligochaeta, polychaeta, tunicata and ciliophora are phylums with a high level of abundance, because the phylum has high adaptability to pollutant. Good water quality is indicated by a variety of biota living in the waters, the range of diversity and uniformity indices shows that meiofauna species are categorized highly diverse and evenly distributed. The dominance index shows that there is no species was dominant, except stations around Losari reclamation project. Temperature, current velocity, depth, brightness, salinity, pH, DO, nitrate-seawater, and phosphate-seawater correlate with meiofauna abundance. The results as a consideration for the management or monitoring of coastal environments. © Ilmu Kelautan, UNDIP.

AB  -                              Many managers have studied the afforestation as a mitigating tool for the problems caused by urbanization, since the specific knowledge of each municipality is fundamental for proper planning in relation to the species used, the number of trees and the location in the municipality. The present research had the objective of evaluating the spatial and biological diversity indexes of the road arborization of the city of Itanhaém - SP. For the accomplishment of the research, a qualitative and quantitative inventory of the arborization was done to obtain the coverage indices and tree density, index of full occupation, current occupation and the deficit of afforestation and the performance index of the species. There is 1 tree for each 100 m                             2                              of sidewalk in the municipality, 2.35% of the sidewalks are covered by the crown of the trees and the municipality presents only 21.1% of the ideal afforestation. The municipality had a high diversity index of Shannon H '= 3.45 and Simpson dominance λ = 0.082. The native species with the best performance index was Schinus terebinthifolius. Although there are species diversity in the municipality, the current situation demonstrates the scarcity of trees, indicating the need for intensification in the planting of trees in the road system.                          © 2019, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.;                              Muitos gestores têm estudado a arborização como ferramenta mitigatória dos problemas causados pela urbanização, já que o conhecimento específico de cada município é fundamental para o planejamento adequado em relação as espécies utilizadas, a quantidade de árvores e a localização no município. A presente pesquisa teve por objetivo avaliar os índices espaciais e de diversidade biológica da arborização viária do município de Itanhaém - SP. Para realização da pesquisa, foi feito um inventário amostral, quali-quantitativo da arborização para obtenção dos índices de cobertura e densidade arbórea, índice de plena ocupação, de ocupação atual e o déficit da arborização e o índice de performance da espécie. Existe no município 1 árvore para cada 100 m                             2                              de calçada, 2,35% das calçadas são cobertas pela projeção da copa das árvores e o município apresenta apenas 21,1% da arborização ideal.

AB  - This study aims to determine the growth response of Rhizophora apiculata against inundation and different sediment thickness as adaptation strategies. This research was conducted in Wonorejo Mangrove Conservation District Rungkut, Surabaya, Indonesia (07º18'32.7 "S and 112º48'59.1" U). The parameters used include plant height, number of branches and number of leaves. The treatment includes waterlogging and 2 control conditions. The treatment includes thick sediment control, and 2 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm sediment thickness. This study is an experimental research using RAL factorial (4×2). Data were analyzed using factorial ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test 5%. The results of this study indicate that the growth of R. apiculata in water logging treatment showed significantly effect on plant height, number of leaves and number of branches. While the thickness of the sediment treatment showed significant influence on the height of R. apiculata. But in terms of number of branches and leaves, the thickness of the sediment did not showed any significant effect. The interaction between thickness of sediment and waterlogged conditions in pools and land showed significant effect on plant height, while on number of leaves and number of branches, their interaction in pools showed no significant effect. © 2018, BIOFLUX SRL.

AB  - Few studies have shown the importance of different pasture management practices on C storage and the reduction of CO2–C emissions in tropical conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine short-term changes in C pools and C balance from different pasture management practices established in the Atlantic Rainforest. A field study was carried out in Alegre, ES, Brazil from September 2013 to August 2014 to investigate the first-year effect of pasture management practices on a Udult clayey soil. The different pasture management practices studied included the following: control (CON), chiseled (CHI), fertilized (FER), burned (BUR), integrated with crop–livestock (iCL) systems, and plowed and harrowed (PH). Monthly disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken at two different layers (0.00–0.05 and 0.05–0.20 m) for chemical, physical, and organic matter characterization. C inputs monitored in aboveground pools included plant aerial parts and litter, and belowground pools included roots and soil C stocks. C outputs monitored were CO2–C emissions, erosion water, and sediment. C balance was considered the difference between inputs and outputs in each treatment during four seasons. The spring and summer seasons had a strong influence on C inputs and outputs where there is significant difference between spring and summer, while the autumn and winter seasons had less influence. All pasture management practices exhibited positive C balance after 1 year. High values of C balance were verified in pastures fertilized (FER) (53.04 Mg ha−1 year−1. Intermediate C balance was found in the burned (BUR) (40.84 Mg ha−1 year−1), traditional control (CON) (40.31 Mg ha−1 year−1), and in the plowing and harrowing (PH) (40.02 Mg ha−1 year−1) management practices. The practices of chiseled (40.00 Mg ha−1 year−1) and integrated crop–livestock systems (iCL) (59.06 Mg ha−1 year−1) resulted in low C balance. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In Indonesia, a huge amount of peat has accumulated under peat swamp forest over millennia. However, a repeatable large-scale fire as a result of land clearing has rapidly devastated these tropical peatlands. These disturbances (e.g. climate change, deforestation, peatland drainage, forest and peatland fires, and land conversion) change the ecosystem respiration and resulting a high carbon emitted to the atmosphere. To restore the peatland ecosystem, Indonesia government makes a special force by using three activities, namely rewetting, replantation, and communal empowerment. These activities need an accurate peatland monitoring. However, accessing the spatial variation of the peatland is quite limited, difficult and laborious. Therefore, we investigated the existence of tropical peatland in Siak, Riau Province, Indonesia. We measured soil moisture at four different types of land cover (namely; forest, oil palm, shrubs, and agriculture) a long with two types of peat conditions. We estimated the Constanta Dielectric (∈) values obtained from a fully polarimetry for ALOS 2/ PALSAR. Results indicated that the ∈ of oil palm was lower in non-peat area than in peat area, whereas the decrease in ∈ probably in peat area resulted from the rapid growth of oil palm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate changes implications on the physiological responses and Zn-reclamation capacity of two native Brazilian plant species [Albizia polycephala and Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae)] were studied. Plants were grown in substrate amended with 0 and 200 mg kg−1, under increasing temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C) and plant physiological responses related to energetic and oxidative metabolism and Zn-uptake and subcellular localization were evaluated. By impairing the mitochondrial metabolism, Zn was seen to induce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, which was stimulated by increasing temperature. However, increasing temperature was also seen to stimulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes, attenuating oxidative damage induced by H2O2 in leaves and roots. Moreover, increasing temperature was responsible for changes in the subcellular localization of Zn, increasing its allocation in the soluble fraction (mainly composed of vacuoles and cytoplasm) - which could be a tolerance mechanism allowing plants to survive in conditions of toxic levels of Zn under increased temperatures. Our results point to an interactive effect of rising temperature on Zn toxicity to plants. Although rising temperatures led to increased uptake of Zn and increased its deleterious effects to mitochondria metabolism (which led to increased H2O2 production), the increases in temperature also promoted the activity of antioxidant enzymes, responsible for H2O2 scavenging, thus attenuating the deleterious effects of this ROS on the cell metabolism of plants. Finally, increases in temperature do not constrain the ability of A. polycephala and P. nites to reclaim Zn and, therefore, these species should continue to be used in Zn-phytoremediation programs even given the prospects of increasing temperatures over the next century due to climatic changes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated. © 2018 American Society of Mammalogists, www.mammalogy.org.

AB  - In the Brazilian Cerrado, despite the increasing adoption of no-till systems, there are still extended areas under conventional soil management systems that reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and increase the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). Conservation agroecosystems, such as no-till, have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate agriculture-induced climatic changes through reductions in N2O emissions. However, the relationship between organic matter and N2O emissions from soils under different agroecosystems is not yet clear. This study hypothesized that agroecosystems under no-till promote an accumulation of labile and stable SOM fractions along with a reduction of N2O emissions. This study evaluated the effects of crop-rotation agroecosystems: i) on C and N pools and labile and stable SOM fractions; ii) on cumulative N2O emissions; and iii) on the relationships between SOM fractions and N2O emissions. The agricultural systems consisted of: (I) soybean followed by sorghum under no-tillage (NT1); (II) maize followed by pigeon pea under no-tillage (NT2); (III) soybean under conventional tillage followed by fallow soil (CT); (IV) and native Cerrado (CER). After CT for 18 years, following the replacement of CER, the soil C stock in the 0–20 cm layer was reduced by 0.64 t ha− 1 year− 1. The no-till systems were more efficient in accumulating labile and stable C fractions with values close to those observed under CER, and were directly related to lower soil N2O emissions. The cumulative pattern of N2O emissions was inverse to that of the following SOM fractions: microbial biomass carbon, permanganate-oxidizable carbon, particulate organic carbon, inert carbon, and humic substances. Based on principal component analysis, the CT was generally separated from the other land use systems. This separation was strongly influenced by the low C contents in the different SOM fractions and higher N2O emissions promoted by the CT. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main interest of the soils acidity correction is to neutralize the exchangeable Al3+, since the presence of this form of Al in the soil restricts root growth and, consequently, decreases the productivity of sensitive crops. Thus, monitoring the advance of the attributes related to soil acidity in depth in the cultivated areas is fundamental to understand the dynamics of the correction on the surface, helping in the decision-making on the reapplication of the limestones. The aim of this study was to quantify the chemical changes in the soil caused by lime application with different Ca:Mg ratios 141 months after its application. The experiment was installed in 2004 under native field in a Typic Hapludalf. The statistical design was a two-factor type with two types of application forms (incorporated and superficial) and five types of limes (a control and lime with Ca:Mg molar ratios of 35.5 (calcitic), 9.0, 5.0, and 3.2 (dolomitic). In July 2016, 36 trenches were opened in each plot and soil samples were collected at depths of 0–60 cm. In the soil layer of 0–10 cm, the soil samples were collected every 1 cm. In the layer of 10–25 cm, the soil samples were collected every 2.5 cm, and in the layer of 25–60 cm, the samples of were collected every 5 cm. In total, 25 depths per trench were sampled, totaling 828 soil samples used for the chemical analyses. The analysis performed were: values of pH in water in the ratio 1:1, Santa Maria Buffer (TSM) an adaptation of SMP (SchoemakeR et al., 1961), Ca, Mg, and Al exchangeable. The saturation by Al and bases was calculated. Twelve years after the application, the simple deposition of the dolomitic lime on the surface of the soil allowed changes in the attributes related to soil acidity in the profile, changes that were like the incorporation. The use of the calcitic lime provided more significant alterations in the attributes related to soil acidity in the profile compared to the dolomite, given its greater solubility in relation to dolomite. Almost twelve years after the natural acidity correction of the soil following the recommendations of the Soil Chemistry and Fertility Commission -RS / SC (2016), a slight reacidification of the soil of the 0–5 cm layer was observed, whose aluminum saturation is still less than 5% in the first 10 cm. Even almost twelve years after the corrective application, superficial or incorporated, still significant migration of the alkalinizing front in the soil profile to depths greater than 20 cm is seen. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Deforestation is a significant source of man-made carbon in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect. Although carbon releases are associated to the ecosystem functions of climate regulation and are essential ecological processes that sustain life, their incremental economic impact is difficult to estimate. Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative “legal framework”; ii) the “status quo” which represents the current development level; and iii) the “new ventures” encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the “legal framework” and “status quo” scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the “new ventures” scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years. Besides carbon release, results also highlight the large amount of carbon still stored in protected areas that is threatened by the regional economics dynamics and requires special attention from the public sector, management bodies and regulators. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our knowledge on the relationship between tropical forest cover and biotic communities is still limited. Understanding the relationship between forest cover and bird functional guilds may serve as a valuable tool to assess how much forest is necessary to conserve significant portions of typical forest assemblages. We sampled birds (198 species, 6883 encounters) along a full gradient of deforestation across 4000 km2 of forest-dominated landscapes in Southwest Cameroon and applied multivariate adaptive regression splines to model α-, β- and γ-richness of guilds in relation to forest cover. Overall, β- and γ-richness remained constant above 42% forest cover. However, total α-richness as well as all richness partitions of Guinea-Congo biome-restricted, large-bodied arboreal foliage gleaning, tree nesting, and frugivorous species declined when forest cover was below 74%. Moreover, ant-followers and terrestrial insectivores showed their highest diversity at zero deforestation. In contrast, open-land, granivorous, opportunistic insectivorous and widespread species strongly increased below 42% forest cover. High β-diversity at intermediate deforestation conditions indicate that the sharp decline of original forest bird diversity may only be compensated by habitat and foraging generalists, which benefit from high habitat heterogeneity. Our study implies that Afrotropical forest bird diversity decreases non-linearly with forest loss. Critical habitat thresholds estimated by us at above 70% are much higher than those previously reported and highlight the need to integrate substantial proportions of natural vegetation within wildlife friendly farming schemes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The flood phenomenon in the Krueng Jreue Sub-Watershed, Aceh Besar, Indonesia, in recent years indicates biophysical damage to the land. Floods are influenced by factors from biophysical conditions of the land and high rainfall with small river cross-sectional capacity causing water to overflow the embankment and flood low areas. This research aims to analyse the flood vulnerability level in the Krueng Jreue Sub-Watershed, Aceh Besar, Indonesia. The results showed that flood vulnerability in the research area consisted of four classes: very vulnerable, vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and somewhat vulnerable, with each area averaging a score of 43.0, 38.8, 30.0 and 21.7. Types of land use that are particularly vulnerable to flooding are rice fields with a mean total score of 43.0. The vulnerable classes are found in settlements and moorings, with a total score of 42.0 and 36.5, respectively. While open land, shrubs, grasslands, primary forests and secondary forests are quite vulnerable to flooding, with a mean total score of 32.5 each: 30.0, 30.0, 28.0 and 27.0. The main components affecting flood vulnerability are rainfall, temperature and land use, while additional components are soil infiltration and slope. Mechanised hydrological disaster mitigation can be performed through optimisation of weir, embung, rorak and check-dam. Vegetative hydrological mitigation efforts can be performed by reforestation and agroforestry systems, maps and flood prediction. Non-technically, hydrological disaster mitigation efforts can be undertaken with legal policies, law enforcement, map creation and prediction of droughts and socialisation of legislation. © 2019.

AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical forests is believed to bring local economic benefits at the expense of global environmental costs. The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households’ income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Partnership programs have gained importance in forestry management. In Indonesia, profit sharing and agroforestry are examples of partnership programs between forest managers and local communities. In this paper, we analyze potential conflicts among participants in these programs. First, we derive a recursive formula to determine the future value of a compartment of plantation to the society, which includes both the forest owner and the local community. While trees are young, the land is also used for agriculture, which is an agroforestry program. When there is a high rate of future discounting and a high rate of natural disturbances, the society may find it profitable to continue the agricultural use of the land. Second, we calculate the profit for the forest owner and the local community separately. To prevent illegal logging, the owner shares a fraction of the profit obtained by selling logs with the local people, which is a profit-sharing program. Illegal logging greatly reduces the profit for the forest owner, especially when trees are tall. Illegal logging of old cohorts is harmful to the local people as well. In contrast, illegal logging of young cohorts provides profit to the local people because they will be hired to replant young trees. Our analysis shows an “overlooking period” in which a conflict of interest exists between the forest owner and the local community. We indicate that the overlooking period can be mitigated by coordination of the shared profit and the wage for the workers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agroforestry is an ecologically and environmentally sustainable land use that offers great promise to carbon (C) sequestration. Forests play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through maintaining current carbon stores and by increasing the rate of carbon sequestration. Vegetation carbon stocks are necessary to be quantified to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential in the ecosystem. Reasonable methods for estimating tree biomass and carbon storage on forest land are increasingly crucial given concerns of global climate change. This study aimed to evaluate C sequestration potential by agroforestry in North Sumatra Indonesia. This study was conducted at the Agroforestry system in Aek Nauli, Simalungun District, North Sumatra. Data collection for primary data was done through a field survey. The present study was carried out to determine above ground tree biomass of Toona sureni (Blume) Merr and Coffea arabica. Data retrieval of T. sureni and C. arabica was done by non-destructive sampling by measuring the diameter at breast height (dbh). The results showed that the potential of average above-ground biomass and carbon storage of T. sureni and C. arabica was 6.25 t ha-1 and 2.88 C t ha-1, respectively. Total aboveground biomass of Toona sureni and C. arabica in the study area was 93.75 ton, while total of carbon storage was 43.16 ton. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate forest fires and their relationship to prevention and mitigation strategies based on the empirical problems raised by this study. Public policy implementation (in this case, the policy of forest fire management) is influenced by the role played by government and by the participation of the public and stakeholders (in this case, companies), as well as the effects of good governance. Thus, from the empirical problems associated with theoretical problems and normative problems, this study raises the influence of the role of central and local government on the implementation of forest fire prevention policy in Indonesia, which is moderated by the good governance variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative approach by adopting survey methodology. The study has aimed to assess both large and small population groups, by selecting and reviewing carefully chosen samples of the population to find the incidence, distribution and relative interrelation of the variables considered (Kerlinger and Lee, 2000). The survey was undertaken in areas of Indonesia that have a high level of vulnerability to forest fires. There are currently six provinces – Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and South Kalimantan – that have the highest intensity of forest fires. The study population was taken from 105 villages in those six major provinces experiencing forest fires. Sample size precision was determined by using Slovin’s formula with a precision of 10 percent and, thus, a sample size of 52 was obtained. Findings: The central government’s activities have no significant effect on regional forest fire prevention. However, the results found that there is a significant effect caused by the interaction between the central and local governments and their governance of forest fire prevention. Even though the direct effect is not significant, the interaction effect significantly influences the forest fire prevention governance variable, which is a pure moderator. This study found that the role of central government has no effect on forest fire prevention. If the role of the central government is high, it will not impact the effectiveness of forest fire prevention, which is reflected in the aspects of prevention and early warning, reward and punishment, the improvement and management of ecosystems by reviewing courts, law enforcement and national and regional synergy. Originality/value: This is one of the few public administration science studies to have investigated the relationship between good governance and forest fire policy in Indonesia, particularly the combined roles played by central and local governments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - One adaptation for farming wetlands is constructing raised fields (RF), i.e., elevated earth structures. Studies of RF agriculture have focused mostly on the vestiges of RF that were cultivated by pre-Columbian populations in the Americas. Ironically, whereas RF agriculture is still practiced nowadays in many parts of the world, including the Congo Basin, these actively farmed RF have received scant attention. Yet, studying how RF function today can shed new light on ongoing debates about pre-Columbian RF agriculture. Also, in a context of climate change and widespread degradation of wetlands, the study of RF agriculture can help us evaluate its potential as part of an environmentally sustainable use of wetlands. We carried out an ethnoecological study of RF agriculture combining qualitative and quantitative methods over a total of eight months' fieldwork in the Congo Basin. We found that RF show great diversity in size and shape and perform several functions. Incorporation of grasses such as green manure, allows RF to produce high yields, and RF agriculture decreases flooding risk. However, it is labor-intensive and is likely always only one component of a multi-activity subsistence system, in which fishing plays a great role, that is both resilient and sustainable. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Land use and land management have a recognized impact on the cycle of elements such as carbon and nitrogen and are thus expected to play an important role in the mitigation against human-induced environmental changes such as global warming. Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years, experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning (B) to mechanized green-trashing (GT), whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain. This study performed in the São-Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, investigated the impact of shifting from B to GT on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks, and chemical elements at three 4-year and one 12-year old trial sites. Soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types (clayey to sandy-clay Hapludox; Hapudult and sandy Quartzpsamment). Sampling was up to 0.4 m (0–0.05; 0.05–0.1; 0.1–0.2; 0.2–0.4 m) depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots (of 0.2 ha size each) per treatment arranged in randomized block design. The samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH and chemical concentrations. Overall, conversion from B to GT increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 12.8–13.0 Mg ha− 1 y− 1, and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 0.4 m soil layer by 1.06 Mg C ha− 1 y− 1 and 0.11 Mg N ha− 1 y− 1, respectively. The highest carbon sequestration rate (108‰ y− 1) occurred in the most carbon depleted soils, which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. All the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration, especially within the topmost soil layer, because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together. Considering the average sequestration rate of 1.06 ton ha− 1 y− 1, the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for Brazil where 8.8 million hectares are under green-trashing of sugarcane residues would be 9.3 million ton C y− 1. However, intermittent tillage every 4–5 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration, suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage. There is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to find sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses. © 2017

AB  - The early growth stage is critical in the response of trees to climate change and variability. It is not clear, however, what climate metrics are best to define the early-growth sensitivity in assessing adaptation strategies of young forests to climate change. Using a combination of field experiments and modelling, we assessed the climate sensitivity of two promising afforestation species, Jatropha curcas L. and Moringa oleifera Lam., by analyzing their predicted climate-growth relationships in the initial two years after planting on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin. The process-based WaNuLCAS model (version 4.3, World Agroforestry Centre, Bogor, Indonesia) was used to simulate aboveground biomass growth for each year in the climate record (1981-2016), either as the first or as the second year of tree growth. Linear mixed models related the annual biomass growth to climate indicators, and climate sensitivity indices quantified climate-growth relationships. In the first year, the length of dry spells had the strongest effect on tree growth. In the following year, the annual water deficit and length of dry season became the strongest predictors. Simulated rooting depths greater than those observed in the experiments enhanced biomass growth under extreme dry conditions and reduced sapling sensitivity to drought. Projected increases in aridity implied significant growth reduction, but a multi-species approach to afforestation using species that are able to develop deep-penetrating roots should increase the resilience of young forests to climate change. The results illustrate that process-based modelling, combined with field experiments, can be effective in assessing the climate-growth relationships of tree species. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - We studied the relationship between the mineralogical composition and surface charge properties of representative Quaternary volcanic ash soils, classified as Andosols, along an East-West sequence on Java Island in Indonesia. The soil charge characteristics were determined using ‘charge fingerprinting’ procedures. Most of the studied soils have a limited ability to retain cations under their forest or grass vegetation. The surface charge properties of these soils are mainly related to allophane and organic matter contents and, to a lesser degree, to ferrihydrite content and layer silicate characteristics. In East Java, the soils are Andosols with low allophane content, dominated either by halloysitic clays or by a mixture of 2:1 and 1:1 layer silicate clays; these soils are characterized by a low to moderate permanent charge. In West Java, the soils are rich in allophane, with subordinate kaolinitic clays, gibbsitic material or a mixture of 1:1 and 2:1 layer silicate clays; in contrast to the allophane-poor soils of East Java, these soils have extreme variable charge characteristics, creating a net ‘positive’ variable surface charge at soil pH. Differences in mineralogical composition of the clay fraction are attributed mainly to more pronounced seasonality in East Java, with variations in parent ash composition, becoming more acidic from east to west, as subordinate factor. The more severely leaching environment in West Java results in a higher degree of desilication, which led to a higher point of zero net charge (PZNC) and pHo in the allophane-rich soils. This study demonstrates how a climatic gradient can affect regional variations in charge properties, through the impact of climate on the mineralogical composition of the clay fraction. Regional patterns of this type must be understood to correctly assess of variations in soil fertility status and to make correct soil management choices for sustainable crop production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas, which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. Birds are widely used for this purpose, and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices, it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes. However, previous studies yield controversial results. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional point-counts survey for forest monitoring in an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection. There was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index, from the six acoustic indices evaluated. We also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the point-count survey caused bias in acoustic indices. Therefore, more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the Atlantic tropical rainforest. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate models predict a possible increase in the frequency of strong climate events such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which in parts of the tropics are the cause of exceptional droughts, these threaten global food production. Agroforestry systems are often suggested as promising diversification options to increase farmers’ resilience to extreme climatic events. In the Northeastern state of Bahia, where most Brazilian cocoa is grown in wildlife-friendly agroforests, ENSOs cause severe droughts which negatively affect forest and agriculture. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is described as being sensitive to drought but there are no field-studies of the effect of ENSO-related drought on adult cocoa trees in the America’s; there is one study of an experimentally-imposed drought in Indonesia which resulted in 10 to 46% yield loss. In our study, in randomly chosen farms in Bahia, Brazil, we measured the effect of the 2015–16 severe ENSO, which caused an unprecedented drought in cocoa agroforests. We show that drought caused high cocoa tree mortality (15%) and severely decreased cocoa yield (89%); the drought also increased infection rate of the chronic fungal disease witches’ broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa). Ours findings showed that Brazilian cocoa agroforests are at risk and that increasing frequency of strong droughts are likely to cause decreased cocoa yields in the coming decades. Furthermore, because cocoa, like many crops, is grown somewhat beyond its climatic limits, it and other crops could be the’canaries in the coalmine’ warning of forthcoming major drought effects on semi-natural and natural vegetation. © 2018 Gateau-Rey et al.

AB  -                              Forest management involving the selective logging of exotic species in order to reestablish native flora alters microclimatic conditions and selects for species with heightened capacity to adapt to the new conditions. This study investigated whether, after forest management involving the removal of eucalyptus, ultrastructural adjustments in the chloroplast fostered the photoacclimation of the most abundant regenerating native species in a Brazilian Atlantic forest biological reserve. The influence of seasonality on photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency after the forest management was also assessed. To achieve this, in the rainy season mature leaves of native tree saplings (Xylopia sericea, Siparuna guianensis, and Byrsonima sericea) were subjected to ultrastructural analyses and the C isotopic composition (δ                             13                             C) was determined; and in the dry and rainy season gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured. Species samples were obtained in: secondary forest, a eucalyptus understory with 15 years of regeneration before and 12 months after the management, and from herbarium samples from eucalyptus understories collected at the beginning of forest regeneration (9–16 years ago, for δ                             13                             C analyses only). Ultrastructural alterations such as the reorganization of thylakoids, starch grain changes, and the presence of plastoglobules and oils were verified after the management in all the species. F                             v                             /F                             m                              values varied between 0.80 and 0.90 regardless of the management or season of the year. There was a reduction of C assimilation after the management, especially in the dry season.                              13                             C enrichment was observed for B. sericea, S. guianensis, and X. sericea in herbarium samples (−31.4‰, −32.0‰, and −31.4‰, respectively) and after the forest management (−31.2‰, −32.5‰, −31.4‰), while samples depleted in                              13                             C were registered before the management (−33.4‰, −33.3‰, −33.2‰) and in the secondary forest (−34.0‰, −33.9‰, and −33.6‰). The data suggest that ultrastructural alterations may have aided in maintaining electron flow after the increase in irradiance due to the forest management, avoiding photochemical stress, as evidenced by F                             v                             /F                             m                              values. The forest management increased the efficiency of water use and fostered abiotic conditions similar to those present at the beginning of the understory regeneration. These previous conditions favored the current high level of abundance of these three species, highlighting the importance of monitoring to ensure that the management practices do not promote the future dominance of few species at the expense this biome's high biodiversity.                          © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatland holds a large amount of carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Indonesia, responding to the global climate issues, has legislation on the protection and management of the peat ecosystem. However, this effort is hampered by the lack of fine-scale, accurate maps of peat distribution and its thickness. This paper presents an open digital mapping methodology, which utilises open data in an open-source computing environment, as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and estimating carbon stock in Indonesian peatlands. The digital mapping methodology combines field observations with factors that are known to influence peat thickness distribution. These factors are represented by multi-source remotely-sensed data derived from open and freely available raster data: digital elevation models (DEM) from SRTM, geographical information, and radar images (Sentinel and ALOS PALSAR). Utilising machine-learning models from an open-source software, we derived spatial prediction functions and mapped peat thickness and its uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m. Peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map, and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content, carbon stock for the area was estimated. The uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules. We demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of Bengkalis Island in Riau Province, covering an area around 50,000 ha. Results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat, explaining up to 98% of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5% or an average error of 0.3 m. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations. We provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production, i.e. 2 to 4 months with a cost between $0.3 and $0.5/ha for an area of 50,000 ha. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. The advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed. The methodology provides a blueprint for a national-scale peat mapping. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Shorea balangeran (balangeran) belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family that is distributed naturally in Indonesia with a wide range of ecological conditions including peat swamp and heath forests. Good adaptability of S. balangeran remains unknown concerning molecular (genetic) responses that are important to provide scientific knowledge for supporting forest restoration, especially for peatland restoration efforts. The main objective of this research was to analyze the ecological aspects and genetic diversity of S. balangeran in two types of forests, namely: peat forests (wetland) and heath forests (dry land). Field research was conducted in Muara Kendawangan Nature Reserve, West Kalimantan following standard vegetation analysis by establishing purposively sample plots (50 m x 50 m). Genetic diversity was assessed by RAPD analysis using ten random polymorphic primers. Results showed that both in heath and peat forests, S. balangeran was dominant, but only at pole and tree stages indicating that poor regeneration capacity of S. balangeran. This finding also confirmed the critically endangered status of S. balangeran as listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Genetic analysis using RAPD did not show a clustering of S. balangeran between peat forest and heath forest populations, indicating that S. balangeran has good adaptability to grow in both forest types. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies. The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC = 0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: “Protected areas-Intangible zone” (PC = 24%, PI = 12.4%), “timber harvesting programs” (PC = 21.7%, PI = 4.7%), “road network” (PC = 18.9%, PI = 7.7%), and “poverty rate” (PC = 3.7%, PI = 6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable “temperature” (PC = 7,9%, PI = 22.3%) provided information in the overall model. The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the outcomes of research carried out under the Sustainable Wetlands Adaptation and Mitigation Programme (SWAMP). SWAMP aimed to inform national and international climate policy and practice by developing tools and methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon stocks and flux in tropical wetlands due to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). This assessment modelled SWAMP's intended outcomes as a theory of change (ToC) and used qualitative methods to test the ToC and to evaluate whether and how the outcomes were achieved. It found that SWAMP research has helped raise academic and policy interest in wetlands, mangroves and peat forests as carbon reservoirs, and that SWAMP's recommendations informed policy discourse and supported the development of technical guidance and strategies of sustainable wetland management. However, the research had a weak effect on international and Indonesian climate change policies compared to other factors. The Paris Agreement and Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) do not include the quantification of carbon stocks from mangroves, which are not all located in the forest areas. Knowledge translation was achieved through a variety of mechanisms, with direct engagement identified as particularly important. The outcome evaluation approach proved useful as a way of conceptualising and organising the analysis of research impact on development outcomes. © 2018 BioOne. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals, isolated from neighboring populations, and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human-modified landscapes. Resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas. Such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances. However, the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated. We present an individual-based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of: 1)differing levels of initial genetic diversity; and 2)different area sizes on short (tens of years)and mid-term (hundreds of years)restored population viability. We demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of Centrolobium tomentosum, a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics, from tropical and temperate forests, to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size. This knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions, increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  -                              The recent publication of the first spatially explicit map of peatlands in the Cuvette Centrale, central Congo Basin, reveals it to be the most extensive tropical peatland complex, at ca. 145,500 km                             2                             . With an estimated 30.6 Pg of carbon stored in these peatlands, there are now questions about whether these carbon stocks are under threat and, if so, what can be done to protect them. Here, we analyse the potential threats to Congo Basin peat carbon stocks and identify knowledge gaps in relation to these threats, and to how the peatland systems might respond. Climate change emerges as a particularly pressing concern, given its potential to destabilise carbon stocks across the whole area. Socio-economic developments are increasing across central Africa and, whilst much of the peatland area is protected on paper by some form of conservation designation, the potential exists for hydrocarbon exploration, logging, plantations and other forms of disturbance to significantly damage the peatland ecosystems. The low level of human intervention at present suggests that the opportunity still exists to protect the peatlands in a largely intact state, possibly drawing on climate change mitigation funding, which can be used not only to protect the peat carbon pool but also to improve the livelihoods of people living in and around these peatlands.                          © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change scenarios tend to intensify extreme rainfall events and drought in Brazil threatening urban water security. Low Impact Development (LID) practices are decentralized alternatives for flood mitigation and prevention. Recently, their potential has increasingly been studied in terms of stormwater harvesting. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about their potentialities in subtropical climate regions. Therefore, this study evaluated the behavior of a bioretention cell in a Brazilian city, during the dry period, which is critical in terms of pollutant accumulation and water availability. In addition to the runoff reduction and pollutant removal efficiency, this paper analyzed the potential for water reuse in terms of the stored volume and water quality guidelines. The results obtained show an average runoff retention efficiency of 70%. Considering only the water availability aspects, the potential stored runoff could be reused for non-potable purposes, reducing the water demand in the catchment by at least half during the dry season. On the other hand, the bioretention presented two different conditions for pollutant removal: Condition A – the concentration values are within the recommended limits for water reuse. The parameters found in this condition were NO3, NO2, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr; Condition B – the pollutant concentrations are above the guideline limits for water reuse and cannot be directly used for different purposes. The parameters found in this condition were Fe, Pb, Ni, Cd and color. Considering water reuse, an additional treatment is required for parameters in this second condition. Further studies should evaluate the design aspects that can allow collection of LIDs effluent, additional treatment if necessary, and reuse in the catchment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global climate changes can affect coffee production in Brazil, and in other coffee producing countries. We examined the potential for an agroforestry system with the native species, macauba (Acrocomia aculeata), to mitigate impacts on coffee production by reducing maximal air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of an agroforestry system with macauba on productivity, microclimatic characteristics and soil physical quality on a coffee plantation in the Atlantic Rainforest biome, in Southern Brazil. We measured soil attributes (moisture, temperature, and physical properties), microclimate conditions (air temperature, photosynthetic active radiation) and coffee production parameters (productivity and yield). Macauba palm trees were planted at different planting densities on the rows and distances from the coffee rows. Planting density of macauba and their distance from the coffee rows affected soil thermal-water regime. Compared with the traditional unshaded sole coffee planting, the intercropped cultivation provided more coffee yield on both macauba density planting and distance evaluated. On the other hand, coffee productivity was increased by agroforestry systems just for 4.2 m distance between palm trees and coffee rows. Planting density of macaubas did not affect coffee yield and productivity. Best coffee harvest in agroforestry systems with macauba was related to higher soil moisture at the depth of 20–40 cm, higher photosynthetic active radiation, and maximum air temperatures lower than 30 °C. Agroforestry with coffee and macauba trees can be an adaptation strategy under future climatic variability and change related to high temperatures and low rainfall. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar, a material defined as charred organic matter applied in agriculture, is suggested as a beneficial additive and bulking agent in composting. Biochar addition to the composting feedstock was shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching during the composting process, and to result in a fertilizer and plant growth medium that is superior to non-amended composts. However, the impact of biochar on the quality and carbon speciation of the organic matter in bulk compost has so far not been the focus of systematic analyses, although these parameters are key to determine the long-term stability and carbon sequestration potential of biochar-amended composts in soil. In this study, we used different spectroscopic techniques to compare the organic carbon speciation of manure compost amended with three different biochars. A non-biochar-amended compost served as control. Based on Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we did not observe any differences in carbon speciation of the bulk compost independent of biochar type, despite a change in the FTIR absorbance ratio 2925 cm− 1/1034 cm− 1, that is suggested as an indicator for compost maturity. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and emission-excitation matrixes (EEM) revealed minor differences in the extractable carbon fractions, which only accounted for ~ 2–3% of total organic carbon. Increased total organic carbon content of biochar-amended composts was only due to the addition of biochar-C and not enhanced preservation of compost feedstock-C. Our results suggest that biochars do not alter the carbon speciation in compost organic matter under conditions optimized for aerobic decomposition of compost feedstock. Considering the effects of biochar on compost nutrient retention, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration, biochar addition during aerobic composting of manure might be an attractive strategy to produce a sustainable, slow release fertilizer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many watershed area in Indonesia and South Sulawesi experience erosion, flood and landslide in rainyseason and in dry season experience drought, like in Minraleng Watershed. This condition have impacted to food insecurity of the community that reside in watershed area. This study aim to formulate adaptive agroforestry model to increase farmer livelihood in supporting watershed management. Population study i.e. all of the farmer household in Minraleng Hulu Watershed. Study sampling was done by purposive sampling in 4 sampling village (Limampoccoe, Cenrana Baru, Timpuseng and Batu Putih). Data collection was done by in-depth interview and observation. Data was analyzed by qualitative descriptive and spatial analysis. Result of the study indicated that combination pattern of landscape agroforestry model need to be developed in dry land and the big property land in Cenrana Baru, Limampoccoe and Batu Putih. That agroforestry model known by Taungya by developing adaptive plant to drought and give livelihood diversification and adaptive to the short rainy season, secure from pest i.e. swine, monkey, and cow. In Timpuseng village, agroforestry pattern need to be was permanent intensive agroforestry which is known by Talun where farmer need to develop three to fourth strata of plant to resolve limited land by planting gamal tress and candlenut in the top of the strata, while planting coffee and pepper in second strata, and chili and elephant grass in third strata. Intensive permanent agroforestry with low labour input to resolve limited farmer labour which dominant in rice field. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper employs a unique ecosystem services analysis methodology to evaluate how cities could support or generate ecosystem services. Ecosystem services analysis can provide quantifiable goals for urban ecological regeneration that are determined by the site-specific ecology and climate of an urban area. In this research, the ecosystem service of habitat provision is the key focus. The role of urban green space and urban forests is crucial within this. Setting ambitious targets for urban ecological performance and ecosystem services provision is of great importance due to the large negative environmental impact that cities currently have on ecosystems and, therefore, ecosystem service provision, and because healthier ecosystems enable humans to better adapt to climate change through creating potentials for increased resilience. A comparative case study analysing the ecosystem service of habitat provision in two existing urban environments with similar climates (Cfb according to the Köppen Climate Classification System) but in different parts of the world, namelyWellington, New Zealand and Curitiba, Brazil, was conducted to examine how the ecosystem services analysis concept can used to devise urban habitat provision goals. The paper concludes that, although achieving habitat provision goals derived from ecosystem services analysis in urban areas is likely to be difficult, determining quantitative site- and climate-specific staged goals could enable urban design professionals to increase the effectiveness of conservation and regeneration efforts in terms of ecosystem service provision from urban green and blue spaces. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Cleaner fruit production has become important for producers worldwide because consumers and retail companies increasingly base their purchase decisions on environmental criteria. Green manure is a soil management practice that promotes soil nutrient enrichment and may improve crop yield. Nonetheless, the environmental impacts and economic analysis of combined green manure and tropical fruit production have not been performed. This work assesses the environmental impacts and profits resulting from the Brazilian melon, commercialized in Brazil. Melon production is analyzed under two cultivation systems: i) the conventional form practiced by farmers located in the São Francisco Valley region, Brazil, and ii) the conservationist system, based on a green manure experiment carried out in this same region. This study applies life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of both systems, considering farm inputs production and transportation (energy power, fertilizers, pesticides, plastic, paper, and fuel) as well as melon production and transportation to the main national distribution market in São Paulo. The impact categories evaluated are climate change, soil acidification, freshwater and marine eutrophication, water depletion, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer), and ecotoxicity. Scenario analysis is applied to assess impacts under different designed conditions for transportation, packing, and nitrogen fertilization. The profit analysis is performed by reducing the total production costs (inputs and services) from the revenue obtained from selling melons. Results indicate that the conservationist system causes lower impacts and lead to higher profit than the conventional system, for all assessed categories. The scenario analysis confirms that impacts can be further reduced in all categories when alternative melon transportation and fertilization practices are adopted. This work demonstrates that the environmental performance of Brazilian melon production can be improved with the addition of green manure and alternative transportation practices. © 2017

AB  - Tropical peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and therefore, their stability has important implications for climate change. In this study, we evaluated the effect of fire on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of peat soils in Indonesia for three years following exposure to fire. The results of the thermal analysis suggest that the organic matter contents of surface soils significantly decreased because of peat fires and that charred materials were produced in the subsurface layer of the burned soils. The atomic ratios of the burned soils and the thermally treated samples indicate that the Indonesian peat soils were dehydrated by these low-severity fires. The microbial abundance and phosphatase activity in the burned soils significantly decreased compared to those of the unburned soils. Leaching of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration from the burned soils is lower than that from the unburned soils. The obtained laboratory results indicate that the concentration of the leached DOC increased drastically after heat treatments near the ignition temperature. It was seen that the denaturation of the soil organic matter caused by the heat from the fire accelerates the exodus of organic carbon in peatlands, which contain huge accumulations of carbon. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The main objective of watershed management is to ensure the optimal hydrological and natural resource use for ecological, social and economic importance. One important adaptive management step in dealing with the risk of damage to forest ecosystems is the practice of agroforestry coffee. This study aimed to (1) assess the farmer's response to ecological service responsibility and (2) analyze the Sekampung watersheds management by providing environmental services. The research location was Air Naningan sub-district, Tanggamus, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The research was conducted from July until November 2016. Stratification random sampling based on the pattern of ownership of land rights is used to determine the respondents. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that coffee farmers' participation in the practice of coffee agroforestry in the form of 38% shade plants and multiple cropping (62%). The logistic regression analysis indicated that the variables of experience and status of land ownership, and incentive-size plans were able to explain variations in the willingness of coffee growers to follow the scheme of providing environmental services. The existence of farmer with partnership and CBFM scheme on different land tenure on upper Sekampung has a strategic position to minimize the deforestation and recovery watersheds destruction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Although macauba palm (Acrocomia aculeata) is a palm native to neotropics with wide distribution in Brazil and has significant potential for biofuel production, little is known regarding its variability and adaptability to environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of macauba palm phenotypes to soil attributes and other environmental factors. Macauba palms from 18 locations of three geomorphological provinces from the state of São Paulo, Brazil, were evaluated regarding chemical, physical and morphological soil attributes and plant morphological attributes. Data were analyzed by uni- and multivariate statistics. Univariate statistical analysis showed that there is great variability of botanical components due to soil fertility, particle size distribution and drainage and to atmospheric climate conditions. Principal component analysis identified the botanical variables fruit weight and size and palm tree circumference at chest height, and the soil variables organic matter of A horizon contents of sand and clay, and exchangeable calcium, manganese, copper, potassium and phosphorus from subsurface horizons as those with the greatest contribution in distinguishing the studied environments. Redundancy analysis identified total sand—inversely associated to water retention—pH—directly influenced by exchangeable bases—and micronutrients Zn and Mn from subsurface horizons, together with soil organic matter from A horizon, as those most associated to the botanical variables fruit weight and size. These associations show that soil fertility and particle size distribution are determining factors for the productive potential of macauba palm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Milk and beef production cause 9% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO2e kg−1 milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the “global beef frontier” in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO2e kg−1 milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from “snapshot” carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Large floodplain lakes provide riparian habitat, are sediment and nutrient sinks, help control flow connectivity and flooding along rivers, and are both used by humans and strongly impacted by human activity. However, water level in many remote large floodplain lakes, especially in developing countries, is often monitored inconsistently or not at all. In this study, a novel method for estimating large lake water level using passive, optical remote sensing data combined with any digital elevation model (DEM) is presented. The method obtains water level estimates at 30 m2 resolution using Landsat, in this case in conjunction with SRTM elevation data, nested within a 240 m2 grid “fishnet”. A probabilistic mean of elevation values for all water-designated pixels (between 5% and 95% filled within each grid) produces lake water levels often accurate to within ±50 cm of gauged reference data on Lake Curuai in the Amazon River and Tonle Sap Lake along the Mekong River. The method is relatively insensitive to cloud cover, especially as lake size increases. This study is the first to use solely passive optical remote sensing data for water level estimation and thus could be used to produce accurate, long-term estimations of water level in many large lakes globally. The use of optical sensors to obtain lake water level is both an important complement and potential alternative to methods that use active sensors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate, fire and soil nutrient limitation are important elements that affect vegetation dynamics in areas of the forest-savanna transition. In this paper, we use the dynamic vegetation model INLAND to evaluate the influence of interannual climate variability, fire and phosphorus (P) limitation on Amazon-Cerrado transitional vegetation structure and dynamics.We assess how each environmental factor affects net primary production, leaf area index and aboveground biomass (AGB), and compare the AGB simulations to an observed AGB map. We used two climate data sets (monthly average climate for 1961-1990 and interannual climate variability for 1948-2008), two data sets of total soil P content (one based on regional field measurements and one based on global data), and the INLAND fire module. Our results show that the inclusion of interannual climate variability, P limitation and fire occurrence each contribute to simulating vegetation types that more closely match observations. These effects are spatially heterogeneous and synergistic. In terms of magnitude, the effect of fire is strongest and is the main driver of vegetation changes along the transition. Phosphorus limitation, in turn, has a stronger effect on transitional ecosystem dynamics than interannual climate variability does. Overall, INLAND typically simulates more than 80%of the AGB variability in the transition zone. However, the AGB in many places is clearly not well simulated, indicating that important soil and physiological factors in the Amazon-Cerrado border region, such as lithology, water table depth, carbon allocation strategies and mortality rates, still need to be included in the model. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - More than half of Brazilian territory (54%), or approx. 463 million ha, is covered by forests. Public forest ownership dominates with up to 80%, private forests cover cca. 20% and cca. 8% is unclaimed. In public forests the practice of concessions is growing, with the expectation of reducing the problem of Amazonian illegal loggings. Private forests are mainly under plantation management, which generates 5.5% of the country's industrial gross domestic product. Relevance of both is accordingly high, although not dominant in forest share. A key question for forest policy is how successfully the state regulates both issues in practice. Our paper accordingly focuses on the Brazilian Forest Service and the Ministry of Agriculture, which are state forest institutions in charge of forest concessions and planted forests. We look at their performance against legally based forestry goals and rely on primary (participatory observation, semi-structured personal interviews and questionnaire) and secondary sources (documents) for empirical evidence. The 3 L Model serves as a theoretical basis. It was selected while applying criteria and indicators for evaluation of public institutions´ comprehensive performance with respect to sustainable forest management. The results show that Brazilian forest policy strives toward sustainable forest management, as an overall goal. In more particular, the performance of both examined state forest institutions is more market (than public demand) oriented and moves towards strengthening market competences. At the same time, there are constrains in sustaining forest stands. Due to permanent and strong conflicts related to land use changes in Brazil, the relevance of a mediator, aiming to harmonize all different interests related to forest protection and use, is high, but this role is still not taken, at least not by the evaluated state forest institutions. This represents new task for the forestry practice, while facilitating diverse interests in Brazilian forests could not only be a contribution toward conflict management between environmental, forestry and agribusiness actors but could also grant stronger political role to respective state forest institution(s). For attending this role, the performance evaluation of the whole and rather complex forest-related institutional setting in Brazil could provide relevant science-based policy arguments. This paper shows that the 3 L Model could be applied for such evaluation, as it was possible to adapt it to a non-European country and get a comprehensive overview of Brazilian plantation and concession forestry in practice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forests are seen as climate mitigation mechanisms by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In addition, their importance in the sustainable development paradigm has been confirmed through their inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are designed to provide a global orientation toward inclusive and sustainable development, yet their implementation presents new challenges for forestry practitioners. This paper uses an ethnographic case study to examine a forestry-based carbon-offsetting project in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and uses several SDGs to analyze the level of project success. The project was created to offset the emissions from the construction of the new football stadium built for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Mato Grosso and, therefore, attracted international attention. The project provides analytical points for a discussion on how forestry-based carbon offsetting fits within the wider discussion on sustainable development and how the success of project outcomes can be influenced in several key areas. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Ecological restoration is suggested as a tool to mitigate environmental problems caused by urbanization, but its utility may be hampered by conflict between ecological design and neighbouring communities' needs. We explore this issue by comparing vegetation diversity and structure in a 21-year-old urban reforestation project in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, with a nearby reference forest, and we assessed popular perceptions about the project. Overall, density and basal area of canopy trees in the restoration plantation reached 73% and 46%, respectively, of the values found in the reference forest, but ground cover by exotic grasses was substantially higher in the planted forest. Rarefied species richness was similarly high in the plantation forest (59 species) and in the remnant forest (69 species), but species composition was markedly different. The human legacy on restoration diminished with time, reflected in the higher proportion of species and individuals of late-successional, native and not-planted species in the seedling community of the plantation forest. While community perceptions of reforestation were positive and both use and non-use values were reported, interviewees reported little involvement in the development of the project, which could have contributed to synergies between ecological and social outcomes. © 2017 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was "weed control + plant seedlings" (34%) for all evaluated methods. The image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient, mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The major drivers of deforestation in West Kalimantan have been the development for large or small-scale expansion of agricultural activities; the establishment of oil palm and other plantations; fire; and degradation of forests particularly from industrial logging. Our previous research findings have shown that such activities in affected peatland areas have lowered the water table levels (down to 0.5-1.0 m depths), and have significantly increased CO2 emissions from the peat soils. It has been demonstrated that unmanaged, lowered water tables in peatlands act as one of the main factors inflating soil carbon emissions - an issue that has assumed global significance in recent decades. Regulating peatland water tables has the potential to mitigate degraded peatland carbon emissions as well as improve the hydrological functions for communities who farm the peatlands. However, we are still uncertain exactly how much impact controlled raising of the peatlands water tables will have on reducing soil CO2 emissions. The research described here aimed to mitigate CO2 emissions by raising and regulating water levels on drained peatland to restore and enhance its hydrological functions. The results confirmed that raising the water table significantly decreases CO2 emissions and improves water availability and management for crop production in the coastal peatland of Kubu Raya district, West Kalimantan. Water levels previously at 60cm below the soil surface were regulated to raise the watertable up to just 30 cm below the surface and this reduced peatland carbon emissions by about 49%. However, longer-term monitoring is required to ensure that the hydrological benefits and CO2 mitigation can be sustained. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt-affected soils play an important role in the Pantanal wetlands ecosystem, in Brazil, but their occurrence on higher landforms is not well understood. In order to investigate the major processes involved in salt-affected soil formation, a trench was opened in a representative transition between the floodplain and a paleochannel-paleolevee complex not currently reached by floodwater. The trench was 6 meter long and 2 meter deep, and 121 soil samples were collected in a 0.25 × 0.25 m regular grid and submitted for soil (particle-size, pH, exchangeable cations) and solution extract (major cation and anions) analyses. Analytical results were subjected to geostatistical and principal components analyses (PCA). For selected horizons, an undisturbed sample was collected to perform thin sections and micromorphology description. The presence of degraded carbonates in the soils indicated an ancient formation. The regional environmental settings of the alluvial fan and particle size variation along the soil profiles suggested that the sediments of the study site were deposited during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, in a river channel-levee complex and an abandoned channel by avulsion processes. The depressed topography of the abandoned channel, accompanied by moderately drier climates during early Holocene, likely favored low leaching of salts and higher evapotranspiration, enabling the development of salt-affected soils. Later erosion of the region, which is expected in older lobes of alluvial fans, triggered a relief inversion in the area, preserving the more clayey areas as a slightly higher landform with remaining salt-affected soils. Currently, the seasonal flooding mainly reaches the footslope of this landform, triggering redoximorphic processes, expressed as redox concentrations and depletions, and solodization processes, expressed by lower values of pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) than at the summit. Thus, the occurrence of salt-affected soils on higher landforms is the reflection of a complex sedimentological history. In this way, the genesis of salt-affected soils on higher landforms, which seems to be poorly understood in many situations worldwide, should be carefully investigated in order to address formation mechanisms, especially in extremely dynamic environments of tropical wetlands. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical wetlands such as peat swamp forests (PSFs) have been known globally as one of the carbon (C)-rich ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of understanding on the C cycle in PSFs, especially in association with land use and cover changes (e.g., ecosystem degradation and restoration). This study presents the C stocks, removals, and emissions dataset, as well as the determining factors from an early restoration stage of secondary tropical PSFs in Central Kalimantan. We assessed various biophysical parameters such as forest structure, above- and belowground C-stocks, aboveground primary productivity, total and heterotrophic soil respirations, and groundwater level (GWL). We found that tree density varied from 1200 to 1825 trees per hectare (ha) across the plots, whereas the mean of stand basal area was 32.86 ± 4.72 m2 ha−1. Mean ecosystem C stocks in the study site was 1752 ± 401 Mg-C ha−1, of which 93% was stored in belowground organic peat soils. A mean aboveground litterfall production of 4.6 ± 0.5 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 and biomass C sequestration through tree diameter increment with 2.7 ± 0.5 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 was obtained. We observed slightly larger portion of annual mean total soil respiration with 14.2 ± 1.1 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 than heterotrophic respiration 11.1 ± 0.9 Mg-C ha−1 year−1, emphasizing the lower contribution of autotrophic respiration from the belowground rooting system. Findings imply that further conservation management efforts through ecosystem restoration may preserve C stored and enhance C input in PSFs substantially, and could be potentially included in national climate change mitigation strategies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Globally, anthropogenic environmental change is exacerbating the already vulnerable conditions of many people and ecosystems. In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales. © 2018 Fedele et al.

AB  - This study configures a first report regarding the variability of meat quality of locally adapted Pantaneiro sheep depending on different physiological stages and breeding systems. Pantaneiro sheep are raised in Brazil under a tropical wetland ecosystem denominated Pantanal. Twenty-nine Pantaneiro sheep from different sex and physiological stages were sorted into three groups, simulating three of the most representative ovine meat products commercialized by South American industries: a) non castrated male lambs (n = 11); b) wethers (n = 9); c) cull ewes (n = 9). Animals from each physiological stage were submitted to different breeding systems, resembling farming strategies adopted in several developing countries of South America. The effect of physiological stages on the quality of meat was accessed using 16 variables measured in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LM) and the semimembranosus (SM) muscles. The variables were related to brightness, color, physical aspects, soluble and total collagen as well as chemical traits. The physiological stage was defined as a classification variable in order to proceed ANOVA tests and comparison of means (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis was used to identify patterns of similarity and differentiation between samples of different physiological stages (a, b, c). The results revealed that meat quality varies according to different physiological stages, especially between lambs (a) and cull ewes (c). As a consequence, the physiological stage at slaughter should be taken into consideration to cote the quality of meat from indigenous sheep raised in tropical regions. The results contribute towards sensorial evaluation and the characterization of potential food products derived from indigenous sheep bred under tropical climate in developing countries. © 2018 Monteschio et al.

AB  - Vital for many marine and terrestrial species, and several other environmental services, such as carbon sink areas, the mangrove ecosystem is highly threatened due to the proximity of large urban centers and climate change. The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations. Moreover, while restoration efforts have increased, few studies have analyzed how recently-planted areas impact the original mangrove genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Araçá Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The interaction between native fleshy-fruit plants and introduced fruit consumers contributes to the dynamics of highly fragmented environments. Such interactions can occur through pollination and seed dispersal. Here, we investigated the potential of seed dispersing by a non-native primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), in an urban Atlantic forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Fleshy fruits from non-native plants were preferentially exploited by the squirrel monkeys. We measured 147 seeds (width and length) from 20 of 106 faecal samples. The dispersed seeds were from five plant species (four families). We found a positive correlation between the size of seeds found in faecal samples with their availability in the habitat. Only one seed was found visually damaged after passage through the squirrel monkeys' guts. The defecated seeds were uniformly distributed (variance to mean ratio index) in the home range of squirrel monkeys, and there was a lack of specific latrines (i.e., habitat preference for defecation). Our data provide evidence that non-native S. sciureus may in be (i) acting as a potential seed disperser of native plants in the Atlantic forest fragment, (ii) contributing to the ecological role of native frugivores, and (iii) potentially contributing to the regeneration process of the highly degraded study site. © 2018 S.

AB  - Climate change has an adverse effect on dryland by decreasing soil organic matter content and hence improving soil fertility through innovative research is urgent. The research aims to investigate the optimum doses of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer to increase soil nutrients availability and on dryland Lithosols. The experiment was conducted on Lithosols at Geneng Duwur village, Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia, with the elevation 112 m above sea level. The experimental was arranged in the randomized complete block design with a single factor, namely doses of organic fertilizer which was composted by liquid biofilm biofertilizer (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 tons ha-1) with three replications. Each treatment occupied a 2 × 3 m2 size plot, then each plot was prepared with holes to plant spinach with plants spacing of 15 cm × 20 cm. Three seeds of spinach were planted at each hole, and they were harvested at the maximum vegetative stage. The observed variables including plants parameters (plant height, stove fresh and dry weight) and soil parameters (organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K)). Data were analyzed using the F test at α = 0.05 and followed by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT). The results showed the application of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer on dryland of Lithosols increased soil nutrients availability (total-N, available-P, exchangeable-K and soil organic matter) and spinach yields. Composting organic fertilizers with biofilm biofertilizer can support integrated farming systems because it provides microbes as the main agents in biogeochemistry reaction process in soil. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Ecological restoration has received increasing attention as international agreements have set ambitious goals to mitigate environmental change and reshape degraded landscapes. However, current restoration activities sometimes remain modest in their success. In particular, tropical forest restoration has had mixed outcomes with variable cost-efficiency. Here, we address the need for taking into account the spatial context of restoration to inform policy initiatives that aim to improve the ecological and economic effectiveness of restoration. We accessed the spatial distribution of relevant characteristics for ecological restoration in an emblematic heavily degraded tropical region: São Paulo state, Brazil. We compared statewide patterns in soil erosion risk, distance to remnant habitat, and agricultural land use, to their characteristics in land voluntarily offered for active restoration. Based on this comparison, active restoration is likely to take place through small, low-priced parcels of land, usually in the context of substantial soil erosion risk and exacerbated deforestation. Restoration ecology predicts the need for expensive actions to assist a limited recovery process in such highly degraded conditions. This general pattern also suggests the necessity for long-term commitment among a broad set of social actors, combined to mitigation of degradation in adjacent remnants and agricultural lands. Active restoration may be complemented by spontaneous regeneration in areas with less adverse conditions. Policy makers therefore need to consider the complementarity of lands voluntarily offered for restoration, and land made available for restoration through other mechanisms. Our findings, likely applicable to other densely populated tropical regions, suggest that land-use policies need to address drivers of restoration success at a fine-scale to enable effective strategies. We suggest this can be achieved by spatial analyses that incorporate biophysical features that determine restoration opportunities and the likelihood of success. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Natural wetlands are the largest source of methane emissions, contributing 20–40% of global emissions and dominating the inter-annual variability. Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change. This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1–34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle. We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Paraná River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Paraná River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Niño Southern Oscillation activity. We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3–11.8 Tg yr−1) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Paraná regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The Brazilian Government has established a target to restore 12 million hectares of the country's forest area by 2030. In this study, we address the economic and financial feasibility of this massive restoration, as well as job creation and government receivables, by applying a traditional valuation method and assumptions from the environmental literature. Conservative scenarios, based on an agricultural producer perspective, indicate that the recovery is economically unviable: the net present value is negative, and though the internal rate of return is positive, it is lower than the cost of capital. However, sensitivity analysis suggests that it may become feasible when considered as an outsourced business and a market for forest carbon capture is included. In terms of public policy, there is still room for creating instruments to improve its feasibility, since we have not addressed other positive externalities and also the sale of non-timber forest products.

AB  - Brazil is one of the major contributors to land-use change emissions, mostly driven by agricultural expansion for food, feed, and bioenergy feedstock. Policies to avoid deforestation related to private commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly 70% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal protection, and an additional 20% is expected to be protected after areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure regularization. About 30% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga biomes hold about 40%, 30%, and 20% of the unprotected AGC, respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on private land only accounts for 6.5% of the total AGC stock. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we attempt to develop the soil moisture retrieval method taking into account a wide variety of vegetation variations for the sparsely vegetated area. The method is constructed by introducing generalized volume scattering model into the polarimetric two-scale two-component model (PTSTCM). The proposed method was applied to L-band fully polarimetric ALOS-2 SAR datasets obtained over tropical peatland, Indonesia. The retrieved results were validated by simultaneously measured in-situ soil moisture. The proposed method yields more improved results than original PTSTCM with specific types of volume model (i.e., randomly, horizontally, and vertically oriented volume models) regarding the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) as well as inversion rate. © 2018 IEEE

AB  - Oil palm monocultures are highly productive, but there are widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Some of these negative impacts might be mitigated by mixed-species tree interplanting to create agroforestry systems, but there is little experience with the performance of trees planted in oil palm plantations. We studied a biodiversity enrichment experiment in the lowlands of Sumatra that was established in a 6- to 12-year-old oil palm plantation by planting six tree species in different mixtures on 48 plots. Three years after tree planting, canopy cover was assessed by drone-based photogrammetry using the structure-from-motion technique. Drone-derived canopy cover estimates were highly correlated with traditional ground-based hemispherical photography along the equality line, indicating the usefulness and comparability of the approach. Canopy cover was further partitioned between oil palm and tree canopies. Thinning of oil palms before tree planting created a more open and heterogeneous canopy cover. Oil palm canopy cover was then extracted at the level of oil palms and individual trees and combined with ground-based mortality assessment for all 3,819 planted trees. For three tree species (Archidendron pauciflorum, Durio zibethinus, and Shorea leprosula), the probability of mortality during the year of the study was dependent on the amount of oil palm canopy cover. We regard the drone-based method for deriving and partitioning spatially explicit information as a promising way for many questions addressing canopy cover in ecological applications and the management of agroforestry systems. © Copyright © 2019 Khokthong, Zemp, Irawan, Sundawati, Kreft and Hölscher.

AB  - Traditional methods for estimating timing parameters in hydrological science require a rigorous study of the relations of flow resistance, slope, flow regime, watershed size, water velocity, and other local variables. These studies are mostly based on empirical observations, where the timing parameter is estimated using empirically derived formulas. The application of these studies to other locations is not always direct. The locations in which equations are used should have comparable characteristics to the locations from which such equations have been derived. To overcome this barrier, in this work, we developed a data-driven approach to estimate timing parameters such as travel time. Our proposal estimates timing parameters using historical data of the location without the need of adapting or using empirical formulas from other locations. The proposal only uses one variable measured at two different locations on the same river (for instance, two river-level measurements, one upstream and the other downstream on the same river). The recorded data from each location generates two time series. Our method aligns these two time series using derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and perceptually important points (PIP). Using data from timing parameters, a polynomial function generalizes the data by inducing a polynomial water travel time estimator, called PolyWaTT. To evaluate the potential of our proposal, we applied PolyWaTT to three different watersheds: a floodplain ecosystem located in the part of Brazil known as Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area; and the Missouri River and the Pearl River, in United States of America. We compared our proposal with empirical formulas and a data-driven state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyWaTT showed a lower mean absolute error than all other methods tested in this study, and for longer distances the mean absolute error achieved by PolyWaTT is three times smaller than empirical formulas. © 2017

AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents the qualitative pollen analysis of a record of Pau de Fruta peatland, from the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional, Diamantina, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in order to investigate past changes in vegetation and climate as well as to provide reference material for the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction inserted in the Cerrado biome, currently found in the studied region. The analysis involved 21 stratigraphic levels from a core sample of 428 cm in lenght, corresponding to the last 10,596 ± 102 years cal BP. The chemical preparation consisted of application of HCl, HF, acetolysis, ultrasound, and mounting the slides in glycerin gelatin. The analyses were carried out under an optical microscope. A total of 128 pollen types, related to 57 families of eudicotyledonous angiosperms were identified and illustrated. These pollen types were related to forest phytophysionomies, represented by the semideciduous forest and mountain forest, and the Cerrado (broad sense) phytophysionomies, including savanna formations (“Cerrado Típico”, “Cerrado Ralo” and “Cerrado Rupestre”), forest areas (“Cerradão”) and grassland formations (“Campo Limpo Seco”, “Campo Limpo Úmido” and “Campo Rupestre”). Ecological information on organisms of origin, as selectivity to light and humidity, were described to provide inferences of environments of occurrence. Wet and cold conditions (~10,000–7360 cal BP), followed by wet and warm (~7360–4200 years cal BP), dry and warm (~4200–2200 years cal BP), dry and punctuated cooling (~2200–1160 cal BP) until current sub-humid climatic conditions (~1160–400 years cal BP and < ~400 years cal BP) are suggested by the succession of vegetation. © 2017 by the Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia.

AB  - Impact of flooding on tropical forest ecosystems and their management is a little-studied area that is expected to become increasingly important under projected climate change. A demonstration of this was provided by the record-breaking 2014 flood of the Madeira River in Brazil. We assessed factors affecting survival of Brazilnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) under root asphyxia caused by flooding in the Lago do Capanã Grande Extractive Reserve in Manicoré municipality (county), Amazonas state, Brazil. Mortality was surveyed in three Brazilnut groves (castanhais) in 680 individual Brazilnut trees of which 357 had been exposed to flooding and 200 had been flooded for at least 83 days, which was the threshold for mortality effects. Trees were georeferenced and measured for DBH and the height above the ground of the flood-water mark. This information, together with topography from satellite data and water levels from hydrographic gauges, allowed calculation of the time each tree was flooded. None of the 323 unflooded trees died. The analysis indicates a relationship between mortality and duration of root asphyxia, killing 17% of the individuals exposed to flooding and 35% of the individuals that were flooded for periods greater than 109 days. Nevertheless, survival exceeded 50% for all flooding durations. The data suggest that larger trees have a greater probability of mortality for any given period of asphyxia. Expected increases in extreme flood events threaten a sustainable forest management system based on harvest of non-timber products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased demand for both agricultural production and forest restoration may lead to increased competition for land in the next decades. Sustainably increasing cattle ranching productivity is a potential solution to reconcile different land uses, while also improving biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. If not strategically implemented in integration with complementary policies, sustainable intensification can however result in negative environmental, economic and social effects. We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land. Our study shows that results from socioeconomic interviews and biophysical modelling of potential productivity increases offer robust insights into practical solutions on how to pursue sustainable development in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ensemble techniques, common in many disciplines, have yet to be fully exploited with spatially explicit projections from land-change models. We trial a land-change model ensemble to assess the impact of policies designed to conserve tropical rainforest at the municipality scale in Brazil, noting the achievements made and challenges ahead. Four spatial model frameworks that were calibrated with the same predictor variables produced 21 counterfactual simulations of the actual landscape. Individual projections with a uniform calibration period gave estimates that between 29 and 68% of the simulated deforestation was saved, but lacked an uncertainty estimate, whilst batch projections from two different model frameworks provided a more dependable mean estimate that 38 and 49% deforestation was prevented with an uncertainty range of 1900 and 1000 km2. The consensus ensembles used agreement between the projections and found that the seven examples with a uniform calibration period produced an error margin of ±435.94 km2 and a prevented forest loss estimate of 50%. Using all 21 projections with diverse calibration periods improved these errors to ±179.26 km2 with a 53% estimate of prevented forest loss. Whilst we achieved a method of combining projections of different frameworks to reduce uncertainty of individual modelling frameworks, demonstrating a control model and accounting for non-linear conditions are challenges that will provide better confidence in this method as an operational tool. Such retrospective evidence could be used to make timely rewards for efforts of governments and municipalities to support tropical forest conservation and help mitigate deforestation. © 2017, Crown Copyright.

AB  - A Pilot Reclamation Project (PRP) was developed in 1982 by the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of Santa Catarina-Brazil, with the objective to evaluating the adaptation of woody species to a land degraded by coal mining. After a full topographic reconstitution of the landscape, addition of nutrient load and sowing of herbaceous species, the area was split into 12 plots in which seedlings of 12 tree species were planted: three native trees [Bastardiopsis densiflora (Hook. and Arn.) Hassl., Mimosa scabrella Benth., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake] and nine exotic species [Eucalyptus saligna Sm., E. viminalis Labill., E. citriodora Hook., Grevillea hilliana F.Muell., Hovenia dulcis Thunb, Melia azedarach L., Pinus elliottii Engelm., P. taeda L., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels]. After 22 years, from the beginning of the PRP, the exotic species presented higher percentage of survival than native species; the plots which received either B. densiflora and S. parahyba or were covered only with herbaceous vegetation associated with solely a few shrubs. Conversely, the plots which received seedlings of M. scabrella displayed clear evidence of restoration in progress. The study conducted in plots that have received M. scabrella indicate an improvement of nutrient load (N, K, organic matter) in the substrate, a diversified composition of tree coverage (very similar to the nearby remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest) and other life forms, with prominent establishment of native trees with predominance of zoophilous and zoochorous species. Some characteristics of M. scabrella that could explain its outstanding capacity to enhance the restoration of the Atlantic Rainforest are also discussed along this paper. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - In Brazil, the cultivation of bioenergy crops is expanding at an accelerated rate. Most of this expansion has occurred over low-intensity pasture and is considered sustainable because it does not involve deforestation of natural vegetation. However, the impacts on the water quality of headwater streams are poorly understood, especially with regard to the influence of land use patterns in the watershed. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use conversion on the water quality of streams draining sugarcane fields and examined whether the preservation of forested areas at the top of the headwaters would help mitigate the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Water samples were collected in two paired catchments in southeastern Brazil, which is one of the largest sugarcane production regions in the world. Our results show significant differences in the water quality of streams predominantly draining the pasture or the sugarcane field. Several parameters commonly used to indicate water quality, such as the concentrations of nitrate and suspended solids, were significantly higher in the sugarcane than in the pasture stream. Differences in water quality between the streams draining predominantly pasture or sugarcane fields were accentuated during the wet season. The preservation of forests surrounding the headwater streams was associated with overall better water quality conditions, such as lower nitrate concentrations and temperature of the stream water. We concluded that forest conservation in the headwater agricultural catchments is an important factor preventing water quality degradation in tropical streams. Therefore, we strongly recommend the preservation of robust riparian forests in the headwaters of tropical watersheds with intensive agriculture. More studies on the effects of best agricultural practices in bioenergy crops can greatly improve our capacity to prevent the degradation of water quality in the tropical waterways as intensive agriculture continues to expand in this region of the world. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale. © 2016 Griscom et al.

AB  - Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks. Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are <300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates. Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants. Location: The Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent. Results: Current forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%–34% of species’ distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusions: Protection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil has been subject to overexploitation in the past prompting the formulation of a rigorous conservation orientated policy by the government including a strict ban of timber harvesting. In the region, the forestland is mostly owned by farmers. The economic value of the forest is rather limited for those farmers, because of the prohibition of commercial timber harvesting as a source of income. Sustainable forest management systems can offer great potential as new income opportunities for land holders, and further actively support the process of ecosystem rehabilitation and protection of these ecosystems. Yet, successful implementation of such sustainable management systems requires feasible and adapted timber harvesting systems. In order to develop such harvesting systems, a regional comparative case study was conducted at a typical smallholder forestry venture with the objective to analyze and evaluate harvesting methods supporting sustainable management of the Atlantic Forest. This study assessed production rates and associated costs of a common conventional timber harvesting method (CM) and a proposed alternative method (AM). CM was performed by a selected, typical forest landowner who had only basic training in chainsaw operations, but 20 years of experience at the wood yard of his small sawmill. In contrast, AM employed a professional chainsaw operator from the Amazon forest, trained and experienced in reduced impact logging techniques using state of the art equipment, supplemented by a snatch block and a skidding cone for improved extraction. Time study based models identified tree volume, winching distance and skidding distance to landing as the most significant independent variables affecting productivity. Total net productivity ranged from 4.9 m3 PMH0-1 for CM to 3.1 m3 PMH0-1 for AM. Corresponding gross-productivity ranged from 3.0 m3 SMH-1 to 1.9 m3 SMH-1 with an overall mean utilization rate of 60.8% and 60.9%, respectively for CM and AM. Associated harvesting costs ranged from 12.05 € m-3 to 20.94 € m-3 with an estimated annual production of 4000 m3 and 2700 m3, respectively. Although AM showed overall lower productivity and higher costs, it enabled important improvements in terms of occupational health and safety. In conclusion, a suitable harvesting system should integrate local experiences of CM and proposed technical improvements of AM. © 2017, Editura Silvica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agroforestry systems may help significantly reduce atmospheric carbon levels in forthcoming years through photosynthesis and regulation of soil CO2 efflux. This study aimed to characterise the soil CO2 efflux dynamics of coffee plants cultivated under agroforestry and full-sun production systems and identify the factors that regulate this process. The study was carried out in agroforestry and full-sun coffee systems on three family farms in Minas Gerais, the Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil during three consective days on each farm. Twenty 1-m2 sampling areas (10 for each system), each separated by a distance of 5 × 5 m and located between coffee plant rows, were selected on each farm. Soil physical and chemical attributes, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, the percentage of canopy cover, and soil CO2 efflux were measured at each sampling area in the two systems. The air and soil temperature in the agroforestry systems were lower and soil moisture was higher than in the full-sun systems. Soil CO2 efflux showed different dynamics in the two systems. Daytime soil CO2 efflux was more stable (i.e. from morning to midday) in the agroforestry system (average 15% increase) compared to the full-sun system (average 49.1% increase). Soil CO2 efflux was regulated by labile carbon and total nitrogen variation in the agroforestry systems, and by soil temperature variation at a depth of 10 cm in the full-sun systems. A principal components analysis with data from all grouped systems showed that soil CO2 efflux was generally positively correlated with soil temperature at 5 and 10 cm depths, and negatively correlated with soil moisture. In conclusion, agroforestry systems promote microclimate stability and decrease soil CO2 efflux variability compared to full-sun systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Peatlands are important natural carbon reservoirs and regulators of water flow and of its dynamic in many natural areas. The structural integrity of these systems has been recognizably threatened by anthropic interventions but has also been significantly influenced by the global climate changes. This study aimed to characterize the water and carbon dynamics in watersheds of two peats independently supplying the Araçuaí River basin in the northeastern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The peats, which were found to be in different states of natural conservation, were investigated for their physical and chemical characteristics, both of the peats and of their stored water. The 14C isotopic analyses of the peat and measurements of the water and organic carbon storage capacity of these peats were performed. The geneses of the corresponding profiles were found to have initiated between the early Holocene (7664 years BP) and the late Pleistocene (11,129 years BP) periods with a vertical growing rate between 0.10 and 0.61 mm y-1. The difference in the degree of natural conservation on the dynamic of water and carbon between these peats was checked by the water and soil attributes. Large quantities of water (mean value for these two peats, approximately 10,108 m3 ha-1) and organic carbon (200 ton C ha-1) were presumably stored during its pedogenetic history. The more anthropically altered peat presented a negative carbon balance and lower water flow in the dry season. The influence of human activities on their carbon and water dynamics reinforces the importance of protecting and conserving these native areas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intensification of soil compaction process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating the search for alternatives to mitigate soil compaction state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder with fertilizer shanks at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The study was conducted in a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S0.10m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0.10m depth; S0.15m: cutting disc combined with shank acting to 0.15m depth and, D0.07m: double discs lagged acting to 0.07m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder with fertilizer shanks acting at 0.15m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Measuring lability of anthropogenically enriched sediment-bound phosphorus (P) to water is a useful tool in ecological monitoring and planning mitigation to tackle diffuse P sources to surface waters. In current study, the sediment-associated total P, P fractions, and P lability accounting for river P legacy was determined. We monitored six representative headwater sub-catchments differing in land-use and management i.e., forest, recently turned low agriculture under conventional-tillage (CT), low agriculture under CT dominated with Ilex paraguariensis plantations, intense agriculture under CT, intense agriculture under no-tillage (NT), and highly anthropic urban receiving untreated sewage; and five sites on the main river in Guaporé river from October 2012 to October 2014. Total P and individual P fractions in 63-μm particle size were determined following the Hedley fractionation and the mean TP concentration lied between 752 mg kg−1 in forest to as high as 1738 mg kg−1 in highly anthropic sediments. The individual P fraction when pooled for different P lability indicated 10, 35, and 55% of TP as labile, moderately labile and non-labile P, respectively. With a land use shift from forest to highly anthropic urban, an increase in labile P (172%), moderately labile P (705%) and non-labile P (874%) was observed. The consistent higher values of non-labile (Pi + PoHID-0.5) and residual P in urban, high agriculture and main river sediment indicates the high P affinity due to the presence of high Fe/Al oxides. Temporal analysis revealed that regardless of P lability, a higher concentration was found in winter months (July to November) particularly under CT sub-catchment showing high sediment production and increased transport of added P during tobacco cultivation period. The results provided a baseline to revisit the current fertilization and soil management practices to minimize the river P legacy for sustainable ecological management. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reducing large-scale deforestation in commodity frontiers remains a key challenge for climate change mitigation and the conservation of biodiversity. Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Habitat modification may change vertebrate and vector-borne disease distributions. However, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession may mitigate these effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that secondary succession influences the distribution of birds and their haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in a seasonally dry tropical forest, a globally threatened ecosystem, in Brazil. Moreover, we assessed seasonal fluctuations in parasite prevalence and distribution. We sampled birds in four different successional stages at the peak and end of the rainy season, as well as in the middle and at the end of the dry season. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that bird communities in the pasture (i.e., highly modified) areas were different from those in the early, intermediate, and late successional areas (secondary forests). Among 461 individual birds, haemosporidian prevalence was higher in pasture areas than in the more advanced successional stages, but parasite communities were homogeneous across these areas. Parasite prevalence was higher in pasture-specialists birds (resilient species) than in forest-specialists species, suggesting that pasture-specialists may increase infection risk for co-occurring hosts. We found an increase in prevalence between the middle and end of the dry season, a period associated with the beginning of the breeding season (early spring) in southeastern Brazil. We also found effects of seasonality in the relative prevalence of specific parasite lineages. Our results show that natural forest recovery through secondary succession in SDTFs is associated with compositional differences in avian communities, and that advanced successional stages are associated with lower prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites. © 2017 Ferreira Junior et al.

AB  - In recent months, strong global growth, rebounding commodity prices, and relatively accommodative financial conditions have benefited the Indonesian economy. The first quarter of 2017 in Indonesia saw resilient GDP growth, moderate inflation, stable exchange rates, an increase in the growth of non-oil exports, and an investment upgrade from ratings agency Standard & Poor's. Investment growth, however, did not pick up enough to drive overall growth to a higher rate. The poor quality of banking-sector assets and the gaps in tax revenue—despite the fulfilment of the government's tax-amnesty program—are two of the most immediate economic concerns. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), who is well into the second half of his term, is under pressure to deliver on his development platform, which includes making progress in sustainable development and climate change mitigation. The effective management of forests is key to this platform. There has been longstanding tension over Indonesia's forests between the protection of environmental values, including carbon storage, and the production of valuable commodities, including timber, palm oil, and pulpwood, which generate revenue and employment. We survey recent developments in four storylines related to forestry and climate change: first, Indonesia's commitment to reducing emissions to 29%–41% below projected business-as-usual levels by 2030, as well as the international climate agreements and finance that can help achieve this commitment; second, land-use rights and regulations, including a moratorium on clearing, draining, or setting fires on peatland; third, measures to prevent catastrophic forest fires like those during the 2015 El Niño, including the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency; and, fourth, the actions of non-state actors, especially large agribusinesses, in managing forests and peatland. We conclude by discussing differences in the approaches of Jokowi's administration and those of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration and by questioning whether Indonesia's budgeted resources, actions, and results to date are commensurate with its climate commitments. © 2017 ANU Indonesia Project.

AB  - The formation of an urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most common impacts of the urbanization process. To mitigate the effects of UHI, the planning of urban forests (e.g., creation of parks, forests and afforestation streets) has been the major tool applied in this context. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of heat islands in Vila Velha, ES, Brazil using the mono-window algorithm. The study followed these methodological steps: 1) mapping of urban green areas through a photointerpretation screen; 2) application of the mono-window algorithm to obtain the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature (LST); 3) correlation between LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference build-up index (NDBI); 4) application of ecological evaluation index. The results showed that the mean values of LST in urban areas were at least 2.34 to 7.19 °C higher than undeveloped areas. Moreover, the positive correlation between LST and NDBI showed an amplifying effect of the developed areas for UHI, while areas with a predominance of vegetation attenuated the effect of UHI. Urban centers, clustered in some parts of the city, received the worst ecological assessment index. Finally, the adoption of measures to guide the urban forest planning within urban centers is necessary to mitigate the effect of heat islands and provide thermal comfort in urban areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vast and disastrous fires occurred on Borneo during the 2015 dry season, pushing Indonesia into the top five carbon emitting countries. The region was affected by a very strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon, on par with the last severe event in 1997/98. Fire dynamics in Central Kalimantan were investigated using an innovative sensor offering higher sensitivity to a wider range of fire intensities at a finer spatial resolution (160 m) than heretofore available. The sensor is onboard the TET-1 satellite, part of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) FireBird mission. TET-1 images (acquired every 2-3 days) from the middle infrared were used to detect fires continuously burning for almost three weeks in the protected peatlands of Sebangau National Park as well as surrounding areas with active logging and oil palm concessions. TET-1 detection capabilities were compared with MODIS active fire detection and Landsat burned area algorithms. Fire dynamics, including fire front propagation speed and area burned, were investigated. We show that TET-1 has improved detection capabilities over MODIS in monitoring low-intensity peatland fire fronts through thick smoke and haze. Analysis of fire dynamics revealed that the largest burned areas resulted from fire front lines started from multiple locations, and the highest propagation speeds were in excess of 500 m/day (all over peat > 2m deep). Fires were found to occur most often in concessions that contained drainage infrastructure but were not cleared prior to the fire season. Benefits of implementing this sensor system to improve current fire management techniques are discussed. Near real-time fire detection together with enhanced fire behavior monitoring capabilities would not only improve firefighting efforts, but also benefit analysis of fire impact on tropical peatlands, greenhouse gas emission estimations as well as mitigation measures to reduce severe fire events in the future. © 2016 Atwood et al.

AB  - In Brazil, a significant reduction in deforestation rates occurred during the last decade. In spite of that fact, the average annual rates are still too high, approximately 400.000 ha/year (INPE/Prodes). The projects of emissions reduction through avoided deforestation (REED+) are an important tool to reduce deforestation rates in Brazil. Understanding the amazon forest structure, in terms of biomass stock is key to design avoided deforestation strategies. In this work, we analyze data results from aboveground biomass of 1,019.346,27 hectares in the state of Pará. It was collected data from 16,722 trees in 83 random independent plots. It was tested 4 allometric equations, for DBH > 10cm: Brown et al. (1989), Brown and Lugo (1999), Chambers et al. (2000), Higuchi et al. (1998). It revealed that the biggest carbon stock of above ground biomass is stocked on the interval at DBH between 30cm and 80cm. This biomass compartment stocks 75.70% of total biomass in Higuchi et al. (1998) equation, 75.56% of total biomass in Brown et al. (1989) equation, 78.83% of total biomass in Chambers et al. (2000) equation, and 73.22% in Brown and Lugo (1999) equation. © 2016, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop national-level safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests. © 2017 by the author(s).

AB  - Tropical forest conservation is considered a low-cost option for climate change mitigation. But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308–923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87–2.60/tCO2 of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385–1153/ha or US$ 1.09–3.25/tCO2. We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD + policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Modeling of the ecological niche of vegetal species is useful for understanding the species-environment relationship, for prediction of responses to climate changes and for correct reforestation programs and establishment of plantation’s recommendation. The objective of this work was to establish a model for the distribution of four tree species (Casearia sylvestris, Copaifera langsdorffii, Croton floribundus and Tapirira guianensis), widely used in reforestation projects in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between environmental characteristics and the occurrence of species and tested the performance of Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks as modeling methods. These methods were evaluated by their overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Kappa, true skill statistic and the area under the receiver operating curve. The results showed the species Casearia sylvestris, Copaifera langsdorffii and Tapirira guianensis widely occurring in the state of Minas Gerais, including a broad range of environmental variables. Croton floribundus had restricted occurrence in the southern state, showing narrow environmental variation. The resulting algorithms demonstrated greater performance when modeling restricted geographic and environmental species, as well as species occurring with high prevalence in data. The algorithm Random Forest performed better for distribution modeling of all species, although the results varied for each metric and species. The maps generated had acceptable metrics and are supported by and ecological information obtained from other sources, constituting a useful tool to understand the ecology and biogeography of the target species. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Peatlands are environmental matrices that store large amounts of organic carbon (TOC) and work as records of environmental changes. Recent record of organic carbon accumulated were assessed in two Forest National Parks, Itatiaia and Serra dos Órgãos in the Southeastern of Brazil. Based on organic and inorganic characterization, the cores from peatlands presented a predominance of organic material in an advanced stage of decomposition and those soils were classified as typical Haplosaprists Histosols. The combination of favorable topographic and climatic conditions led to rapid C accumulation across coastal mountain in the tropical peatlands studied, presenting an average accumulation rate of C, in the last century, of 194 g C m− 2 yr− 1 about 7 higher times than the rate found in boreal and subarctic peatlands, those higher values may be related to changes in the hydrological cycle occurred since 1950s. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the thermal conditions of urban areas in Petrolina-PE, from continuous data collected in urban and rural areas for the year of 2012. The results characterized urban heat islands (UHI) with varying intensity in urban areas, especially UHI = 5.3 °C (high intensity) occurred on April 28, 2012. It was evident that the constituent elements of urban areas contribute to the formation and expansion of UHI bringing thermal discomfort for its inhabitants. An adaptation to Thom’s equation for calculating the Thermal Discomfort Index (DIT), was used to obtain the maximum (DITx) and minimum (DITm) thermal discomfort. In the urban area, the DITm indicated thermal comfort in 23.0% of the days and partial comfort in 77.0% of days surveyed. Already, the DITx characterized 71.6% of days with partial comfort and 28.4% of days with thermal discomfort. In the rural area, The DITm indicated that 41.5% of days were thermally comfortable and 58.5% of days had partial comfort. However, the DITx pointed 87.7% of the days of this environment with partial thermal comfort and 12.3% of thermally uncomfortable days. Finally, the results showed that afforestation of urban area constitutes to an effective and efficient way to mitigate thermal discomfort. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Meteorologia.

AB  - This paper presents Building with Nature as a viable alternative to the traditional engineering approach, making the services that nature provides an integral part of the design of hydraulic infrastructure, thereby creating benefits for nature and society. In it we describe the necessary steps with which to implement a Building with Nature approach. Our case study in Demak, Central Java, Indonesia is used for examples to illustrate this approach and the lessons learnt on benefits and challenges. The location in Demak concerns a tropical muddy mangrove coast. During the last decades, in several areas the coastline has retreated hundreds of meters up to several kilometres, while in other parts of the project area the threat of erosion and flooding by the sea and decline of aquaculture productivity continue to worsen. In 2015, a pilot project to restore the natural coastal mangrove forest was started. The first step was to establish a good understanding of the complex natural and local socio-economic environments. Based on this system understanding, we then chose for non-traditional solutions using temporary permeable structures made from local material to create wave-sheltered areas that stimulate the settlement of sediment and create a habitat favourable to mangrove recolonisation. Once the mangrove forest is fully-grown it will provide protection against waves. It will also provide other ecosystem services like food provisioning, tourism, nursery habitat for fishery production and CO2-storage. A long-term sustainable solution requires the integration of these technical measures into the local socio-economic and governmental context. To support a smooth transition towards sustainable practices, local communities are simultaneously trained in sustainable methods to improve the productivity of their aquaculture ponds. This is done using "coastal field schools" as modelled from the "farmer field school" methodology developed by the FAO in 1989 for rural development. The approach is embedded in the village regulations. Sustainability in this rural area is created by closely linking safety and livelihood. The key lessons learnt from this project are that a combination of a thorough understanding of the biophysical, socio-economic and governmental system and early stakeholder involvement results in higher vital benefits, reduces costs and provides the setting for sustainable design solutions. It requires a learning and adaptive planning cycle from all participants as this approach exemplifies a "learning by doing" approach. © Australasian Coasts and Ports 2017 Conference.

AB  - Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brazil is trying to identify ways to ally economic growth with climate change mitigation. Productivity gains in livestock have been pointed out as a promising alternative to achieve that goal. Thus, this paper analyses the economic impacts of a policy of productivity gains in the Brazilian livestock. Besides, we evaluate if the policy may conciliate agricultural growth and deforestation control, bearing in mind the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use changes. The analysis was carried out through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, tailored to represent land-use changes, GHG emissions and removals. Besides, it made progress modeling the heterogeneity of climate, soils, and emissions in inter-regional models with many regions. The results show that productivity gains can effectively “save” land and thus avoid deforestation, especially in the Amazon and Cerrado (savannah) biomes. The policy also may boost the economic growth, spreading it to other regions of Brazil, like Centre-West and North, and increasing income and consumption in those places. However, as a climate policy, focused on the reduction of GHG emissions, the results may be counterproductive. The net amount issued may increase, as a result of the positive stimulus of the policy on the economy, and GHG emissions are directly related to the economic growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The spatial distribution of species is affected by dispersal barriers, local environmental conditions and climate. However, the effect of species dispersal and their adaptation to the environment across geographic scales is poorly understood. To investigate the distribution of species from local to broad geographic scales, we sampled termites in 198 transects distributed in 13 sampling grids in the Brazilian Amazonian forest. The sampling grids encompassed an area of 271 500 km2 and included the five major biogeographic regions delimited by Amazonian rivers. Environmental data for each transect were obtained from local measurements and remote sensing. Similar to previous studies, termite species composition at the local scale was mostly associated with measures of soil texture and chemistry. In contrast, termite species composition at broad geographic scales was associated with soil nutrients, and the geographic position of the transects. Between 17 and 30% of the variance in termite species composition could be attributed exclusively to the geographic position of the transects, but could not be attributed to measured environmental variables or the presence of major rivers. Isolation by distance may have strong effects on termite species composition due to historic processes and the spatially structured environments along distinct geological formations of Amazonia. However, in contrast to many taxa in Amazonia, there is no evidence that major rivers are important barriers to termite dispersal. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The annual and regular flood pulse is the main hydrologic feature found in the large floodplains along Amazonian rivers triggering nutrient cycles, growth rhythms and life cycles of the biota as well as primary and secondary productivity. The construction of hydroelectric dams in the Amazon basin substantially alters the hydrologic regime resulting in severe social, ecological and environmental impacts. While the majority of studies evaluate these impacts in the area of the reservoir and the surroundings of the dam, we focus on disturbances in floodplain forests downstream of the hydroelectric power plant, in this case the Balbina dam, constructed in the 1980s damming the Uatumã River (Central Amazonia). The lowest topographies in the floodplain forests downstream of the dam are dominated by dead trees of Macrolobium acaciifolium (Benth.) Benth. (Fabaceae), a flood-tolerant species forming annual tree rings in consequence of the flood pulse. In this study we evidence alterations in the magnitude and frequency of the hydrologic conditions of the Uatumã River downstream of the hydroelectric power plant comparing the pre-dam (1973–1982) and post-dam (1991–2012) period analyzing a set of biologically relevant hydrologic indicators. To investigate the relationship between the hydrologic changes caused by the dam and the year of death of individuals of M. acaciifolium we use cross-dating techniques (dendrochronology) and radiocarbon dating (14C) as two independent methods. Cross sections of 17 dead individuals were analyzed and individual tree-ring series cross-dated with a well-replicated living trees’ chronology of the same species and region (1804–2012). The outermost tree ring was isolated to perform radiocarbon dating. The dendrochronological and 14C proxies matched in 88% of the cases, while in the 12% mismatched maximum deviation at least one year. Trees died during periods of consecutive years of inundation, up to two decades after the implementation of the hydroelectric dam. Considering the planning of construction of several dozen dams in the Amazon region there is a critical need to include the downstream impacts in all discussions of hydroelectric implementation. © 2017

AB  - Carbon emissions from the conversion and degradation of tropical forests contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess cost-effectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatially-targeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at ~2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km-2) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km-2), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km-2). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km-2. Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipó region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaço mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipó cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index – SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index – EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipó has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deforestation and land-use change in tropics have increased over the past decades, driven by the demand for agricultural products. Although phosphorus (P) is one of the main limiting nutrients for agricultural productivity in the tropics, the effect of land-use change on P availability remains unclear. The objective was to assess the impacts of land-use change on soil inorganic and organic P fractions of different availability (Hedley sequential fractionation) and on P stocks in highly weathered tropical soils. We compared the P availability under extensive land-use (rubber agroforest) and intensive land-use with moderate fertilization (rubber monoculture plantations) or high fertilization (oil palm monoculture plantations) in Indonesia. The P stock was dominated by inorganic forms (60 to 85%) in all land-use types. Fertilizer application increased easily-available inorganic P (i.e., H2O-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi) in intensive rubber and oil palm plantations compared to rubber agroforest. However, the easily-available organic P (NaHCO3-extractable Po) was reduced by half under oil palm and rubber. The decrease of moderately available and non-available P in monoculture plantation means that fertilization maintains only the short-term soil fertility that is not sustainable in the long run due to the depletion of P reserves. The mechanisms of this P reserve depletion are: 1) soil erosion (here assessed by C/P ratio), 2) mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) and 3) P export with yield products. Easily-available P fractions (i.e., H2O-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi and Po) and total organic P were strongly positively correlated with carbon content, suggesting that SOM plays a key role in maintaining P availability. Ecologically based management is therefore necessary to mitigate SOM losses and thus increase the sustainability of agricultural production in P-limited, highly weathered tropical soils. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mangrove restoration or rehabilitation is usually based on planting native or exotic species and these actions rarely result in a return to the natural variability of biological assemblage structures and functions that is self-sustaining. One of the major causes of this failure is not attempting to remove stressors that limit natural ecosystem processes (i.e., in mangroves, any act that disturbs the hydroperiod, input of resources, or constrains regulators) in the framework for restoration. Despite this scientific consensus, this has not been put into practice. Here, we analysed a field experiment carried out over 12 years ago, to compare three planted and three reference mangrove stands (natural and previously undisturbed), with no attempt to remove the various causes of disturbance. Forest structure and productivity, sediment features, pollutants, and benthic macrofauna, which are all equally adapted to the mangroves natural conditions and are sensitive to physical disturbances and pollution, were assessed. Values for all environmental variables and almost all species and trophic groups densities differed between planted and reference sites. The fauna in planted areas was qualitatively the same as that in the reference areas, but the assemblages reflected environmental stressors, mainly pollutants (trace metals and nutrients) in the sediment and also hydroperiod alterations (differences in elevation), but not forest structure or functioning. The results indicate that: (i) forest structure and productivity in planted areas were not as would be expected for a time frame of 12 years; (ii) even with constant potential recolonisation of species from surrounding reference areas, planting alone was not sufficient for ecosystem and benthic macrofaunal recovery. We recommend that ecological engineering follows the best practice available to restore mangrove ecosystems by removing the environmental stressors, establishing natural topography, and assessing the long-term success of the projects. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forested areas of Kalimantan, Indonesia, are often inhabited by swiddeners, and are also targeted by a range of interventions related to development and forest conservation, including REDD+. Whether these interventions are adopted, adapted or rejected by the local people is linked to the varying degrees of access to information that different types of households have, which also leads to unequal sharing of the associated benefits. This paper analyses factors influencing household access to agriculture and forestry-related information using quantitative and qualitative methods in three communities in West-Kalimantan, and draws lessons for designing REDD+. Household socio-economic characteristics (origin, status, migration patterns) and the divide between sub-groups in the communities (caused by origin, opinions, residential location, and relationships) were found to influence household access to information. Suggestions for improved REDD+ information exchange include: having more targeted and incentivised REDD+ activities; encouraging more equitable information sharing; and taking better account of local realities while designing REDD+.

AB  - The continuous measurements of N2O emissions from the aeration tanks of three activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operated with biological nitrogen removal (BNR) and non-BNR were performed during the different operating conditions of several parameters, such as aeration, dissolved oxygen (DO) profiling and organic shock loading (with landfill leachate). The nitrification process is the main driving force behind N2O emission peaks. There are indications that the variation of the air flow rate influenced N2O emissions; high N2O emissions denote over-aeration conditions or incomplete nitrification, with accumulation of NO2 concentrations. Thus, continuous measurements of N2O emissions can provide information on aeration adequacy and the efficiency of complete nitrification, with major focus on DO control, in order to reduce N2O emissions. An additional concern is the observed propensity of WWTPs in developing countries to receive landfill leachates in their wastewater systems. This practice could have adverse effects on climate change, since wastewater treatment during periods of organic shock loading emitted significantly higher amounts of N2O than without organic shock loading. In short, non-BNR WWTPs are subject to high N2O emissions, in contrast to BNR WWTP with controlled nitrification and denitrification processes. © IWA Publishing 2017.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are important for the global carbon cycle as they store 18% of the total global peat carbon. As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Ficus and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost. Taking advantage of available palaeoecological records and advances made in Quaternary studies, some considerations for management practice such as identification of priority taxa and conservation sites are suggested. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green Growth (GG) has emerged as a global narrative, replacing to some extent and integrating earlier sustainable development narratives, while Reducing Emissions through avoiding Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has developed as major item in climate change negotiations. GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation. © 2018 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo / Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and procebes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are lobes in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocebing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested. Copyright © 2016 by AIChE.

AB  - Agroforestry systems and tree cover on agricultural land make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha-1. Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases.

AB  - Human pressure on natural habitats increases the importance of agroforests for biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest, a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m2 were established, and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap. The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior of Psyllids and absence of natural enemies enable their diversity to increase when they are adapted to a new host. We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees. © 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluation of CO2 flux from peatland soil respiration is important to understand the effect of land use change on the global carbon cycle and climate change and particularly to support carbon emission reduction policies. However, quantitative estimation of emitted CO2 fluxes in Indonesia is constrained by existing field data. Current methods for CO2 measurement are limited by high initial cost, manpower, and the difficulties associated with construction issues. Measurement campaigns were performed using a newly developed nocturnal temperature-inversion trap method, which measures the amount of CO2 trapped beneath the nocturnal inversion layer, in the dry season of 2013 at a drained tropical peatland near Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This method is cost-effective and data processing is easier than other flux estimation methods. We compared CO2 fluxes measured using this method with the published data from the existing eddy covariance and closed chamber methods. The maximum value of our measurement results was 10% lower than maximum value of eddy covariance method and average value was 6% higher than average of chamber method in drained tropical peatlands. In addition, the measurement results shows good correlation with groundwater table. The results of this comparison suggest that this methodology for the CO2 flux measurement is useful for field research in tropical peatlands. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The global significance of carbon storage in Indonesia’s coastal wetlands was assessed based on published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass and mangrove biomass and soil pools. For seagrasses, median above- and below-ground biomass was 0.29 and 1.13 Mg C ha−1 respectively; the median soil pool was 118.1 Mg C ha−1. Combining plant biomass and soil, median carbon storage in an Indonesian seagrass meadow is 119.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the estimated total seagrass area of 30,000 km2, the national storage value is 368.5 Tg C. For mangroves, median above- and below-ground biomass was 159.1 and 16.7 Mg C ha−1, respectively; the median soil pool was 774.7 Mg C ha−1. The median carbon storage in an Indonesian mangrove forest is 950.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the total estimated mangrove area of 31,894 km2, the national storage value is 3.0 Pg C, a likely underestimate if these habitats sequester carbon at soil depths >1 m and/or sequester inorganic carbon. Together, Indonesia’s seagrasses and mangroves conservatively account for 3.4 Pg C, roughly 17 % of the world’s blue carbon reservoir. Continued degradation and destruction of these wetlands has important consequences for CO2 emissions and dissolved carbon exchange with adjacent coastal waters. We estimate that roughly 29,040 Gg CO2 (eq.) is returned annually to the atmosphere–ocean pool. This amount is equivalent to about 3.2 % of Indonesia’s annual emissions associated with forest and peat land conversion. These results highlight the urgent need for blue carbon and REDD+ projects as a means to stem the decline in wetland area and to mitigate the release of a significant fraction of the world’s coastal carbon stores. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Although pioneer studies showed several decades ago that deep rooting is common in tropical forests, direct measurements of fine root distributions over the entire soil profile explored by the roots are still scarce. Our study aimed to compare, 2 years after planting, fine root traits of Eucalyptus trees planted from cuttings and from seedlings in order to assess whether the propagation mode has an influence on the capacity of the trees to explore very deep soils. Soils cores were sampled down to a depth of 13.5 m at the peak of leaf area index (LAI), 2 years after planting, under three Eucalyptus clones (belonging to species E. saligna, E. grandis × E. urophylla, E. grandis × E. camaldulensis) and under E. grandis seedlings in the same Ferralsol soil. LAI was estimated using allometric equations based on destructive sampling of eight trees per genotype.All the genotypes exhibited fine root densities roughly constant between the depths of 0.25 and 6.00 m. Changes in fine root traits (diameter, specific root length and specific root area) were low between the topsoil and the root front. The ratios between mean tree height and root front depth ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 for the four genotypes. Although tree vertical extension was roughly symmetric above and belowground for all the genotypes, the depth of the root front ranged from 8.0 m for the seedlings and the E. grandis × E. urophylla clone to 11.5 m for the E. saligna clone. Soil water content profiles suggested that the four genotypes had the capacity to withdraw water down to a depth of 8-10 m over the first 2 years after planting. Total fine root length ranged from 3.3 to 6.0 km per m2 of soil depending on the genotype. The root area/leaf area ratio ranged from 1.3 to 3.2 and was negatively correlated with LAI across the four genotypes. This pattern suggests that the genotypes more conservative for water use (with a low LAI) invest more in fine root area relative to leaf area than genotypes adapted to wet regions (with a high LAI). The velocity of downward movement of the root front might be a relevant criterion in the last stage of the breeding programs to select clones with a fast exploration of deep soil layers in drought prone regions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program (“Programa ABC”). The model estimates EI using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management. The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from − 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$·ha− 1·yr− 1) to around 300 R$·ha− 1·yr− 1, respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated EI of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO2e/kg CWE) relative to 3.59 kg CO2e/kg CWE for optimized management. Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EI. The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAI. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The impact of agricultural and livestock activities on tropical forests often results in long-lasting damage to soil and vegetation. In undisturbed tropical forests, nutrient stocks tend to be larger in the aboveground biomass than in the soil profile; therefore, deforested sites may remain bare for decades due to nutrient limitation. In such circumstance, amelioration of edaphic conditions and planting of tree species adapted to open canopy conditions (pioneers) could help restore ecosystem functions while providing a sustainable source of timber and prompting natural succession. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of biochar as a soil amendment that could accelerate the reforestation of degraded lands. We used a randomized block design with five treatments and four replications, comparing the performance of exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla × Eucalyptus grandis) and native Tachigali vulgaris trees. We monitored reforested plots for 49 months, evaluating tree survival and growth rates, litter production, canopy cover and density of invasive grasses. The addition of biochar in the soil did not result in significant differences in tree survival or productivity when compared to controls. Comparing the two species, native trees (T. vulgaris) performed better by all metrics, showing 52% survival and producing 241.7 Mg ha-1 of aboveground biomass after four years of growth. During that same period the survival rate of eucalyptus was 38% and the aboveground productivity was only 82.4 Mg ha-1. In contrast with eucalyptus plantations, T. vulgaris showed rapid canopy cover and completely suppressed invasive grasses, generating up to 11.7 Mg ha-1 more litter than eucalyptus trees. Although eucalyptus is one of the most commonly used species in reforestation for timber, charcoal, and pulp and paper production in Brazil, our results demonstrate that T. vulgaris has the potential to replace eucalyptus in commercial plantations with the added benefit of being a native species that can promote the establishment of a stable forest cover in degraded sites. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth's land surface1, but store one-third of soil carbon2. Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests2,3. Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin4. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene5. The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent2. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 × 1015 grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin6. Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future reduction in precipitation7,8. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Haze pollution over the past four decades in Southeast Asia is mainly a result of forest and peatland fires in Indonesia. The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration. We recommend that our results be incorporated into future cost-benefit analyses of the fires and mitigation strategies. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) implementation strategies articulate different aims, goals, and interests across different scales of governance and social-ecological contexts. When SFM is implemented in common pool or public forests, governmental initiatives play a central role in defining formal institutions that will interact with the local social-ecological context. At the same time, local actors’ practices of governing common pools forests are also a key factor in SFM implementation. This article uses a critical institutionalism lens to analyse how interactions between a new set of formal institutions with pre-existing local institutions result in (un)expected governance outcomes when implementing SFM on the ground. Using the Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil as a case study, it shows how local actors (bricoleurs) perform institutional bricolage processes by rejecting, adapting, or integrating institutions linked to SFM implementation strategies to their social-ecological contexts. The article is based on a qualitative data analysis from twenty interviews with local and governmental actors, and nine site visits to rural settlements and industries. It concludes that formal SFM institutions in Caatinga do not dialogue with all the different roles that forests resources have in the livelihood of local actors, but rather have a dominant focus on the production of forest biomass for energy supply. Moreover, we found that the success of SFM implementation is highly dependent on the interactions amongst local actors within the social-ecological context. Accordingly, positive results are only achieved when these interactions help to face implementation challenges, specifically those linked to bureaucracy and to technical capacity. © 2018, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

AB  - Ever since a global mitigation mechanism that aims to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) was introduced in climate change negotiations, governance challenges in implementing this concept in tropical forest countries have received considerable attention. In particular, multilevel governance has been identified as a key challenge, as REDD+ aims to tackle local deforestation activities through a global results-based financial scheme. This paper will present an analysis from seven REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and Vietnam) where 293 qualitative interviews were conducted with national-level REDD+ actors. We examined what kind of multilevel coordination problems emerge, particularly in relation to horizontal, cross-sectoral coordination, and analysed these problems through the concepts of functional alignment, institutional complexity and accountability. We argue that there are problems with coordination that have emerged due to failures in recognizing the key multilevel issues. REDD+ is not adequately integrated into existing policies, and there is a gap between REDD+ and sectoral and national development policies. This leads to overlapping regulations and unequal resource allocation among sectors. Our analysis suggests that effective coordination mechanisms for REDD+ should be built on existing mechanisms and experience, include all the stakeholders, ensure the flow of information across the levels and harness the potential of REDD+ itself to overcome multi-sectoral problems. At the national level, there is great awareness of the issues that hinder coordination and effective REDD+ implementation, but this awareness does not seem to be matched by the actions taken to date. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil has low levels of human development and a marginal environment subject to chronic water scarcity. This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and bio-fertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multi-functional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background and aims: While the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests, there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2 m. The factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood, creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change. We set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fast-growing trees in deep tropical soils. Methods: Fine root growth and mortality of Eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6 m, from 2 to 4 years after planting. Results: In the topsoil, the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer (20 cm m−2 d−1) whereas, below 2 m deep, it was at the end of the dry winter (51 cm m−2 d−1). The maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 3.6 cm d−1 in the 5–6 m soil layer. Conclusions: Our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon, water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic nonessential trace metals in the environment, with high persistence and bioaccumulation potential, and hence of serious concern to environmental quality and public health. Emitted to the atmosphere, this element can travel long distances, far from emission sources. Hg speciation can lead to Hg contamination of different ecosystem components, as well as biomagnification in trophic food webs. To evaluate the effects of atmospheric Hg deposition in tropical forests, we investigated Hg concentrations in earthworm tissues and soils of two Forest Conservation Units in State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Next, we performed a laboratory study of the biological responses (cast analysis and behavioral, acute, chronic and bioaccumulation ecotoxicological tests) of two earthworms species (Pontoscolex corethrurus and Eisenia andrei) to Hg contamination in tropical artificial soil (TAS) and two natural forest soils (NS) spiked with increasing concentration of HgCl2. Field results showed Hg concentrations up to 13 times higher in earthworm tissues than in forest soils, while in the laboratory Hg accumulation after 91-days of exposure was 25 times greater in spiked-soils with 128 mg Hg kg− 1 (dry wt) than in control (unspiked) soils. In all the toxicity tests P. corethrurus showed a higher adaptability or resistance to mercury than E. andrei. The role of earthworms as environmental bioremediators was confirmed in this study, showing their ability to greatly bioaccumulate trace metals while reducing Hg availability in feces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to tackle global warming, especially for reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions when replacing fossil fuels. However, it can compete for land with food production. Brazil is a global player on soybeans farming and most of the biodiesel produced in the country comes from it. This work proposes a new approach to evaluate its impact, associating land use change (LUC) analysis with life cycle assessment (LCA) in a representative Brazilian soybeans farming zone. LUC assessment used Landsat satellite imagery analysis from the years 1993 and 2013, and intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) guidelines to estimate GHG emissions. LCA was based on field data collection processed with SimaPro®. Results show that the increment on annual GHG emissions per hectare, derived from the apportioning total emissions for the period studied, was 50.16 kg CO2 eq ha−1 y−1. From this increment, 97.1 % come from LUC, being the largest share from converting pastures to soybeans farming (81.2 % of the total emissions). However, in the area, a large share of converted pastures are degraded, acting as source of emissions, not as sink as considered by IPCC. At the same time, practices like no-tillage make soybeans a carbon sink. Therefore, results could change if alternative approaches were to be adopted, being a challenge for future work. Therefore, when considering biodiesel from soybeans, a close regard to local land use dynamics is essential to evaluate impacts. Besides, promoting more efficient use of land already cleared with the goal to avoid deforestation can turn biodiesel into a sustainable renewable energy source. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Indonesia is seeking to expand its cocoa production to meet the increased international demand. However, this effort faces economies of scale and ecological challenges. This research aims at evaluating environmental performance of cocoa production from cocoa monoculture and cocoa-agroforestry by life cycle assessment based on ISO 14040 and 14044, with adaptation for local impact indicators. This study defined cocoa-agroforestry as raw and sequential of cocoa–coconut and cocoa–rubber agroforestry, combined with shading trees Leucaena sp. and Gliricidia sepium. The analysis considered cocoa production at farm level, from cradle to on-farm gate boundary for 1 metric tonne of cocoa pod. The results showed that cocoa–coconut agroforestry had the least contribution to global impact categories of global warming, acidification and eutrophication, accounting for 3.67E+01 kgCO2-eq, 4.31E-02 kgSO2-eq, and 2.25E-05 kgPO4-eq respectively. Cocoa–coconut agroforestry also had the highest organic carbon and soil organic matter, conditions supporting the growth and activity of beneficial soil microbeds (Pseudomonas sp. and Trichoderma sp.). In addition, total land equivalent ratio of cocoa–coconut agroforestry had the highest value at 1.36, indicating a highest yield advantage was gained. Therefore, cocoa–coconut agroforestry could be a wise option to promote environmental sustainability of cocoa cultivation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aims: We tested two mechanisms of adaptation to extreme hydrological stresses (flooding and drought) of species making up a tropical wetland plant community by measuring leaf gas exchange and water potential. We hypothesized that anoxic conditions that occur during flooding will decrease leaf gas exchange when compared to the dry season, and that 'super-dominant' species will have a distinctive physiological advantage when compared to other plants within the community. Location: Northern Pantanal wetland, Private Natural Heritage Reserve of the Brazilian Social Service of Commerce (RPPN-SESC Pantanal), Mato Grosso, Brazil. Methods: Two periods representing typical extreme hydrological conditions in the Pantanal wetland were selected based on historical soil and meteorological measurements: (1) a drought period when plants experience stress due to soil moisture deficits during a dry season that persists for several months (May to Sept), and (2) a flooding period when oxidation-reduction potential is negative for 30 d or more (Mar or Apr), indicating anoxic stress. Measurements of gas exchange and leaf water potential were made on seven species in drought and flood stress conditions. The seven species represent the majority of the plant community. Results: As a whole, the plant community showed significantly lower potential net photosynthesis (PN) during flooding when soil oxidation-reduction potential reached close to -900 mV when compared to the dry season, but the magnitude of the decline in PN was species specific. Not all super-dominant species showed higher PN compared to non-dominant species, but they did demonstrate higher stomatal conductance and transpiration leading to lower water use efficiency. The combination of higher PN despite low soil water content suggests that the plant community had access to deep water resources. This access was also confirmed by the midday leaf water potential, which was similar for the flood and dry seasons. Conclusions: Results suggest that the plant community may have high physiological performance under a wide range of soil oxidation-reduction potentials. Higher PN rates of super-dominant species indicate a physiological advantage of these species in the different hydrological conditions. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Human activities, in particular agricultural production, interfere with natural cycles of nutrient elements, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), leading to growing concerns about water quality degradation related to excessive nutrient loadings. Increases in agricultural production in response to population growth and wealth generation further increase risks associated with nutrient pollution. This paper presents results from projections of nutrient exports from global agricultural crop and pasture systems to the water environment generated using a process-based modeling approach. Brazil, China, India and the United States account for more than half of estimated global N and P loadings in the base year. Each country boasts large agriculture centers where high calculated loading values are found. Rapid growth in global agricultural nutrient loadings is projected. Growth of agricultural pollution loading is fastest in the group of low-income developing countries and loading growth rates also vary substantially with climate change scenario. Counter measures need to be taken to address the environmental risks associated with the projected rapid increase of agricultural nutrient loadings. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Crop-livestock-forest (CLFi) and crop-livestock (CLi) systems are among the most recent agricultural developments in Brazil, and aligned with the principles of cleaner production. Such integrated systems can provide at least three types of product from the same land area over a defined period. This paper presents a holistic sustainability evaluation using life cycle assessment to compare combinations of integrated and conventional systems in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, intensification achieved through good practices such as association, rotation, and succession by an agroforestry system, optimization of inputs (including water, energy, fertilizers, and crop protection agents), land use, soil quality, biodiversity and social aspects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research suggests that there is substantial public support (including willingness to pay) for forest conservation. Based on a nationwide survey experiment in Brazil (N 2500) the largest and richest of the world's tropical developing countries, we shed new light on this issue. To what extent does the public in fact support forest conservation and what factors are influencing support levels? Unlike previous studies, our results show that the willingness to pay for tropical forest conservation in Brazil is rather low. Moreover, framing forest conservation in terms of biodiversity protection, which tends to create more local benefits, does not induce more support than framing conservation in terms of mitigating global climate change. The results also show that low levels of trust in public institutions have a strong negative impact on the public's willingness to pay for forest conservation, individually and/or via government spending. What could other (richer) countries do, in this context, to encourage forest conservation in Brazil and other tropical developing countries? One key issue is whether prospects of foreign funding for forest conservation are likely to crowd out or, conversely, enhance the motivation for domestic level conservation efforts. We find that prospects of foreign funding have no significant effect on willingness to pay for forest conservation. These findings have at least three policy implications, namely, that the Brazilian public's willingness to pay for forest conservation is very limited, that large-scale international funding is probably needed, and that such funding is unlikely to encourage more domestic effort, but is also unlikely to crowd out domestic efforts. Restoring public trust in the Brazilian government is key to increasing public support for forest conservation in Brazil. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Anthropogenic forest disturbance and land use change (LUC) in the Amazon region is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere in Brazil, due to the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) emitted from vegetation clearance. Land use conversion associated with management practices plays a key role in the distribution and origin of C in different soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. Here, we show how changing land use systems have influenced soil C and N stocks, SOM physical fractions, and the origin of SOM in the Santarém region of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Soil C and N stocks were calculated for the surface layer of 0-30 cm. Anthropogenic disturbances to the standing forest, such as selective logging and wildfires, led to significant declines in soil C and N stocks. However, in the long-term, the conversion of the Amazon forest to pasture did not have a noticeable effect on soil C and N stocks, presumably because of additional inputs from pasture grasses. However, the conversion to cropland did lead to reductions in soil C and N content. According to the physical fractionation of SOM, LUC altered SOM quality, but silt and clay remained the combined fraction that contributed the most to soil C storage. Our results emphasize the importance of implementing more sustainable forest management systems, whilst also calling further attention to the need for fire monitoring systems, helping to ensure the resilience of C and N stocks and sequestration in forest soils; thereby contributing towards urgently needed ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Summary. Earth mounds called ‘murundus’ are conspicuous features in the semi-arid region of Brazil, where their distribution and origin remain largely unknown. We adopted an approach based on spatially explicit mapping and modeling to determine the current and potential geographical distribution of murundus. We set up a systematic grid survey to map their current distribution using high-resolution satellite imagery available via free open source software. To obtain insights into the origin of these earth mounds, predictive models were used to test their geographical congruence with six mound-building termites (genera Cornitermes Wasmann, 1897, and Syntermes Holmgren, 1909). The Maxent algorithm was used to generate the potential distribution models based on a set of five variables related to primary environmental regimes that determine the fundamental niche of termite species. To analyze if there was some congruence between associated environmental variables, we cross-checked the results obtained from the statistical tests using MAXENT software. Murundus mostly occur in the south-central region of the Caatinga biome (i.e. seasonally dry tropical forest) in areas with moderate annual mean temperature (20–24°C) and precipitation (600–910 mm), and soils with moderate to severe constraints concerning nutrient availability. We observed a strong geographical congruence between the potential distributions of densely packed murundus and four mound-building termites [i.e. Cornitermes bequaerti Emerson, 1952, C. silvestrii Emerson, 1949, Syntermes dirus (Burmeister, 1839) and S. wheeleri (Emerson, 1925)]. Based on the significant association of those distributions with the climate and soil nutrient availability, we concluded that the formation of murundus in the semi-arid domain might be an adaptive response of mound-building termites to particular regional environmental conditions. © 2017 Société entomologique de France.

AB  - Changes in Brazil’s climate have aggravated drought conditions, yet the government continues to favor populist policies over ensuring sustainable energy and water resources. This paper analyses the underlying environmental and policy conditions that have led to Brazil’s current power and water crisis and argues in favor of an overhaul of the federal energy infrastructure to reduce political influence in a regulated market and to improve initiatives of reforestation to mitigate the effects of climate change. The effects of poor climate and energy policies so clearly manifested in the Brazilian crisis should serve as a warning to other countries that sustainability is a choice, not a causal eventuality. © Common Ground, Michael J.

AB  - Developing and institutionalizing cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable land use remains a crucial, yet politically contested, objective in global sustainability governance. There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation” (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, “landscape” approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of “niche” sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business-as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The corms and leaves of elephant foot yams (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson) are important foods in the local diet in many Asian regions. The crop has high productivity and wide agroecological adaptation and exhibits suitability for the agroforestry system. Although the plant is assumed to reproduce via panmixia, a comprehensive study on the genetic background across regions to enhance wider consumer palatability is still lacking. Here, ten informative microsatellites were analyzed in 29 populations across regions in India, Indonesia and Thailand to understand the genetic diversity, population structure and distribution to improve breeding and conservation programs. The genetic diversity was high among and within regions. Some populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and bottlenecking. Pairwise FST indicated very high genetic differentiation across regions (FST = 0.274), and the Asian population was unlikely to be panmictic. Phylogenetic tree construction grouped the populations according to country of origin with the exception of the Medan population from Indonesia. The current gene flow was apparent within the regions but was restricted among the regions. The present study revealed that Indonesia and Thailand populations could be alternative centers of the gene pool, together with India. Consequently, regional action should be incorporated in genetic conservation and breeding efforts to develop new varieties with global acceptance. © 2017 Santosa et al.

AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Bamboo grove may cause changes in the structure and floristic composition of natural regeneration. This study evaluated the impact caused by Bambusa tuldoides Munro at natural regeneration, in riparian forest in Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Two areas were evaluated: riparian forest without bamboos (SB) as the reference area, and riparian forest dominated by Bambusa tuldoides (CB). In 2014, ten plots (10×10 m) were installed in each area. All individuals belonging to classes I (30≤ H <130 cm) and II (CBH≤5 cm) were measured and identified. Floristic composition, phytosociological indexes, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness, Simpson dominance, Sorensen similarity, and cluster analysis by Twinspan were evaluated. Richness and absolute density decreased in CB compared to SB. The areas presented low floristic similarity, and high dominance of one or more species in both classes. Myrtaceae was the predominant botanic family in SB, especially Campomanesia xanthocarpa. In CB most species were secondary, as Myrsine umbellata, Cupania vernalis, and Ocotea puberula. Due to the large differences between SB and CB, the groups formed were restricted mostly to the species of each area. Species such as Myrsine umbellata (class I and II) and Strichnos brasiliensis (class II) appear as indicators and former of groups in CB. We concluded that high density of Bambusa tuldoides affect the richness and diversity of regeneration natural, changing the establishment and perpetuation of the species. Secondary species show greater potential for adaptation to these environments and can act as key species in management and recovery actions. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fragmentation of tropical forests is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A key question is understanding how fragmentation impacts phylogenetic diversity, which summarizes the total evolutionary history shared across species within a community. Conserving phylogenetic diversity decreases the potential of losing unique ecological and phenotypic traits and plays important roles in maintaining ecosystem function and stability. Our study was conducted in landscapes within the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled living trees with d.b.h. ≥ 4.8 cm in 0.1 ha plots within 28 fragment interiors and 12 fragment edges to evaluate the impacts of landscape configuration, composition and patch size, as well as edge effects, on phylogenetic diversity indices (PD, a measure of phylogenetic richness; MPD, phylogenetic distance between individuals in a community in deep evolutionary time; and MNTD, phylogenetic distance between each individual and its nearest phylogenetic neighbour). We found that PD and MPD were correlated with species richness, while MNTD was not. Best models suggest that MPD was positively related to edge density and negatively related to the number of forest patches, but that there was no effect of landscape configuration and composition metrics on PD or MNTD, or on standardized values of phylogenetic structure (sesPD, sesMPD and sesMNTD), which control for species richness. Considering all selected models for phylogenetic diversity and structure, edge density and number of forest patches were most frequently selected. With increasing patch size, we found lower PD in interiors but no change at edges and lower sesMNTD regardless of habitat type. Additionally, PD and sesMNTD were higher in interiors than at edges. Synthesis. Changes in MPD and sesMNTD suggest that extirpation of species at edges or in highly fragmented landscapes increases the dominance of species within a subset of clades (phylogenetic clustering), likely those adapted to disturbance. Smaller patch sizes are phylogenetically diverse and overdispersed, probably due to an invasion of edge-adapted species. Conservation must enhance patch area and connectivity via forest restoration; pivotally, even small forest patches are important reservoirs of phylogenetic diversity in the highly threatened Brazilian Atlantic forest. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This study explored the feasibility of decentralized gasification of oil palm biomass in Indonesia to relieve its over-dependence on fossil fuel-based power generation and facilitate the electrification of its rural areas. The techno-feasibility of the gasification of oil palm biomass was first evaluated by reviewing existing literature. Subsequently, two scenarios (V1 and V2, and M1 and M2) were proposed regarding the use cases of the village and mill, respectively. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V1 and M1 scenarios are determined by the total amount of oil palm biomass available in the village and mill, respectively. The capacity of the gasification systems in the V2 and M2 scenarios is determined by the respective electricity demand of the village and mill. The global warming impact and economic feasibility (net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)) of the proposed systems were compared with that of the current practices (diesel generator for the village use case and biomass boiler combustion for the mill use case) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Under the current daily demand per household (0.4 kWh), deploying the V2 system in 104 villages with 500 households each could save up to 17.9 thousand tons of CO2-eq per year compared to the current diesel-based practice. If the electricity could be fed into the national grid, the M1 system with 100% capacity factor could provide yearly GHG emissions mitigation of 5.8 × 104 ton CO2-eq, relative to the current boiler combustion-based reference scenario. M1 had a positive mean NPV if the electricity could be fed into the national grid, while M2 had a positive mean NPV at the biochar price of 500 USD/ton. Under the current electricity tariff (ET) (0.11 kWh) and the biochar price of 2650 USD/ton, daily household demands of 2 and 1.8 kWh were required to reach the break-even point of the mean NPV for the V2 system for the cases of 300 and 500 households, respectively. The average LCOE of V2 is approximately one-fourth that of the reference scenario, while the average LCOE of V1 is larger than that of the reference scenario. The average LCOE of M1 decreased to around 0.06 USD/kWh for the case of a 100% capacity factor. Sensitivity analysis showed that the capital cost of gasification system and its overall electrical efficiency had the most significant effects on the NPV. Finally, practical system deployment was discussed, with consideration of policy formulation and fiscal incentives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Caatinga forests occupy an area of around one million km2 in the semiarid region of northeast Brazil. These landscapes are undergoing rapid change because of accelerated deforestation for cultivation and firewood. The capacity of Caatinga forests to regenerate after clearing determines the magnitude of the carbon (C) sink in the soil, and thus is fundamental information for developing management policies for long-term sustainability. The objective of this study was to investigate C stocks and microbial activity in soils of dry Caatinga forests that had undergone harvesting at different times in the past. Soils were collected from three depths (0–5, 5–10, and 10–20 cm) within seven sites representing a sequence of years since cutting: 0.5, 6, 9, 12, 25, 50, and undisturbed (at least 80 years since cutting). Samples from each depth interval were analyzed for total C concentration and stock, humic substances, labile-C, and microbial biomass C. In addition, indicators of microbiological activity, such as basal respiration, microbial quotient, and metabolic quotient, were determined for the two shallow layers. The results showed that C stocks and microbiological activity were strongly influenced by forest cutting times, and reflect significant C losses associated with this type of management. They also suggest that reaccumulation of C following disturbance is slow. Those areas in which the vegetation has remained undisturbed for longer periods have larger C stocks, indicating that long-term maintenance of vegetation increases C storage in soils. For example, 20 years after cutting the C concentrations in soil and humic fractions had recovered to only about 32% of the presumed maximum found for the 80-year site. The average time for C in soil and humic fractions to return to their initial values at these sites is estimated to be approximately 65 years. Even achieving 50% recovery would require at least 33 years between cutting campaigns. Our findings show that in the context of mitigating climate change on a global scale, forest management entities should restrict cutting intervals in semiarid regions such as the Caatinga to longer than 30 years, to allow these soils to rebuild significant C stocks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We investigated the key mitigation options for achieving the mid-term target for carbon emission reduction in Indonesia. A computable general equilibrium model coupled with a land-based mitigation technology model was used to evaluate specific mitigation options within the whole economic framework. The results revealed three primary findings: (1) If no climate policy were implemented, Indonesia's total greenhouse gas emissions would reach 3.0 GtCO2eq by 2030; (2) To reduce carbon emissions to meet the latest Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDC) target, ~58% of total reductions should come from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors by implementing forest protection, afforestation and plantation efforts; (3) A higher carbon price in 2020 suggests that meeting the 2020 target would be economically challenging, whereas the INDC target for 2030 would be more economically realistic in Indonesia. © 2016 by the author.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo / Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and procebes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are lobes in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocebing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested. Copyright © (2016) by AIChE.

AB  - Eucalyptus camaldulensis has potential for timber, energy, pulp and cellulose production in Brazil due to its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. The use of improved seeds, selected for economic growth traits, is necessary to increase productivity of commercial stands. Seed seedlings orchards (SSO) are one option for improved seed production. However, pollen contamination from unimproved populations, as well as non-random mating in the SSO, can decrease the predicted genetic gains in selected populations. Thus, we investigate the mating system, pollen flow and dispersal patterns in an E. camaldulensis SSO and progeny test (PT), established with seedlings collected in the SSO, using seven microsatellite loci. All trees in the SSO were mapped, sampled, and genotyped. For the PT, we sampled, genotyped, and measured the total height of seedlings from 25 families. We detected 10% inbreeding in the PT, resulting mainly from selfing. Furthermore, we found a correlated mating rate of 18.5% in the SSO, indicating that within the PT there are some full-sibs. Using paternity analysis, we found 14.7% pollen contamination and a pattern of pollen dispersal between near neighbor trees in the SSO. We found 9.5% of inbreeding depression for seedlings height. Due to pollen contamination and nonrandom mating in the SSO, the actual genetic gains for growth traits in the PT are probably lower than the predicted genetic gains. We discuss some management strategies in the SSO that can be used to increase genetic gains in commercial reforestation established using seeds collected from the SSO. © Silvae Genetica.

AB  - Corn and grass intercropping is an interesting practice, and forage plants belonging to the genus Urochloa are the most commonly used in these situations. These plants show excellent adaptation to low-fertility soil, easy establishment, considerable biomass production, as well as being an important competitor with weeds. In agrosilvopastoral systems, the yield of corn crops grown together with trees is hindered due to the reduced radiation incidence caused by tree shading. This study aimed to evaluate corn growth, light interception, and chlorophyll content when intercropped with marandu grass in an agrosilvopastoral system with one and three eucalyptus rows, and compare them with plants under full sun. The experiment was conducted in Andradina - SP (Brazil). Treatments consisted of intercropping with no eucalyptus (plants under full sun: control), one system with one eucalyptus row and another with three rows. We also assessed the effect of five distances between corn plants and eucalyptus trees (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 m). Between eucalyptus rows, corn plants were intercropped with marandu grass. The analyzed variables were corn plant height, ear height, chlorophyll content index, light interception, dry matter, and fresh and dry forage weights. The experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial scheme plus a control, with four repetitions. Tree arrangements had no influence on corn forage, dry matter, plant height, or ear height. Lower results of yield, dry matter, plant height, and ear height were observed for plants spaced 2 m from trees. In the first two evaluations, significant differences of light interception were found for the different distances. Neither tree arrangements (one and three rows) nor the distances from the trees had any impact on corn heights, with no difference between control and the agrosilvopastoral systems. Neither plant distances from trees nor tree arrangements had an influence on chlorophyll content index of corn plants, with no difference between control and the treatments. As a result, corn growth and forage yield under agroforestry systems are similar in arrangements of 1 and 3 eucalyptus rows (15-month-old trees) and under full sun. However, corn dry matter contents were lower in systems containing trees. Intercropping corn and marandu grass in a system without trees increased light interception at harvest time, indicating a larger soil coverage. Corn forage yield and dry matter content were lower when plants were 2 m apart from eucalyptus trees since this condition provided a lower amount of light and greater competition for water and nutrients.

AB  - Recent discussions on forests and climate change have highlighted the potential for conservation of tropical forests to contribute synergistically to both mitigation (reducing emissions of greenhouse gases) and adaptation (increasing capacity to cope with changing climate conditions). Key mechanisms through which adaptive advantages might be gained include the potential for forest resources to support livelihoods in the context of climatic strains on agriculture and the protection that intact forest ecosystems might provide against landslides, flash floods and other hazards related to extreme weather. This paper presents findings from field research with forest communities in three areas of the Congo Basin in Central Africa, in which the adaptive role and potential of forests in these respects is critically analysed. The investigation was carried out through a combination of structured and semi-structured qualitative techniques within six villages in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The findings of the research highlight the need to understand both the limits of synergy, and the constraints and trade-offs for rural livelihoods that may be associated with a forest conservation agenda driven by the additional impetus of carbon sequestration. The search for synergy may be conceptually laudable, but if forest management actions do not take account of on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs then the result of those actions risks undermining wider livelihood resilience. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Tropical forest conversion to agricultural land leads to a strong decrease of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. While the decrease of the soil C sequestration function is easy to measure, the impacts of SOC losses on soil fertility remain unclear. Especially the assessment of the sensitivity of other fertility indicators as related to ecosystem services suffers from a lack of clear methodology. We developed a new approach to assess the sensitivity of soil fertility indicators and tested it on biological and chemical soil properties affected by rainforest conversion to plantations. The approach is based on (non-)linear regressions between SOC losses and fertility indicators normalized to their level in a natural ecosystem. Biotic indicators (basal respiration, microbial biomass, acid phosphatase), labile SOC pools (dissolved organic carbon and light fraction) and nutrients (total N and available P) were measured in Ah horizons from rainforests, jungle rubber, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations located on Sumatra. The negative impact of land-use changes on all measured indicators increased in the following sequence: Forest < jungle rubber < rubber < oil palm. The basal respiration, microbial biomass and nutrients were resistant to SOC losses, whereas the light fraction was lost stronger than SOC. Microbial C use efficiency was independent on land use. The resistance of C availability for microorganisms to SOC losses suggests that a decrease of SOC quality was partly compensated by litter input and a relative enrichment by nutrients. However, the relationship between the basal respiration and SOC was non-linear; i.e. negative impact on microbial activity strongly increased with SOC losses. Therefore, a small decrease of C content under oil palm compared to rubber plantations yielded a strong drop in microbial activity. Consequently, management practices mitigating SOC losses in oil palm plantations would strongly increase soil fertility and ecosystem stability. We conclude that the new approach enables quantitatively assessing the sensitivity and resistance of diverse soil functions to land-use changes and can thus be used to assess resilience of agroecosystems with various use intensities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering 22% of the country, and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem. Campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems, composed of a mosaic of herbaceous, shrubland and savanna vegetation, generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow, acidic and nutrient-poor soils. In the context of increased land-use changes, effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems. Although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre, the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short- and long-term in the main herbaceous vegetation types: the sandy and stony grasslands. We monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short-term vegetation recovery. Diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the long-term vegetation dynamics. Our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires, suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities. We did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire, whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands. No change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted, probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem. After fire, biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types. High biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Growth and development of plants frequently are limited by multiple abiotic stresses that occur simultaneously in the environment. ‘Cabruca’ an agroforestry system is a main cropping system invariably adapted for cultivation of cacao in southern Bahia, Brazil. In this system of management, cacao is grown under the shade of native species of the Atlantic Forest. However, growing cacao under the shade of trees is still questionable due to higher incidence of pests and diseases and difficulty of evaporation of excess soil water in high rainfall periods that often causes flooding. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the performance of two clonal genotypes of cacao, contrasting for tolerance to soil flooding (TSA 792 – tolerant and TSH 774 – intolerant), subjected to four levels of light intensity and two water regimes, control and flooded, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of tolerance to these stresses under ‘Cabruca’ environment. All the plants survived the period of flooding, however, with flooding stress visual symptoms like leaf chlorosis, lenticels hypertrophied on the stem base, and decomposition of roots were observed. Obtained results demonstrated morpho-physiological and molecular changes in response to low light intensity and low light intensity × soil flooding interaction. Significant effects (p < 0.05) of isolated factors, double interaction and inter- and intra-genotypic differences (p < 0.05) were observed for leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and growth parameters. Differences among light intensities, water regime, plant organ (p < 0.001), and for the interactions low light intensity × water regime and water regime × plant organ (p < 0.01) were observed with respect to total soluble sugar content. Isolated factors and double and triple interactions (p < 0.01) had significant effects on the starch accumulation. Triple interaction was also observed in the expression of genes coding for ADH, LDH and PDC enzymes and for aquaporin PIP1;2. Low light intensity interacts with soil flooding, limiting the damages caused by flooding in cacao plants under lowest light intensity. Flooding was the dominant factor for the most physiological responses observed during the interaction between light intensity and soil flooding whose physiological adjustments were different amoung the clonal cocoa genotypes assessed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was the first non-governmental organization composed of multi-stakeholders to ensure the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of forest resources. FSC prohibits certain chemicals and active ingredients in certified forest plantations. A company seeking certification must discontinue use of products so listed and many face problems to comply with these constraints. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of certification on pest management from the perspective of Brazilian private forestry sector. Ninety-three percent of Brazilian FSC-certified forest companies rated leaf-cutting ants as “very important” pests. Chemical control was the most important management technique used and considered very important by 82 % of respondents. The main chemical used to control leaf-cutting ants, sulfluramid, is in the derogation process and was classified as very important by 96.5 % of the certified companies. Certified companies were generally satisfied in relation to FSC certification and the integrated management of forest pests, but 27.6 % agreed that the prohibitions of pesticides for leaf-cutting ant and termite control could be considered as a non-tariff barrier on high-productivity Brazilian forest plantations. FSC forest certification has encouraged the implementation of more sustainable techniques and decisions in pest management in forest plantations in Brazil. The prohibition on pesticides like sulfluramid and the use of alternatives without the same efficiency will result in pest mismanagement, production losses, and higher costs. This work has shown that the application of global rules for sustainable forest management needs to adapt to each local reality. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) present strong seasonal greenness signals ideal for tracking phenology and primary productivity using remote sensing techniques. The tightly synchronized relationship these ecosystems have with water availability offer a valuable natural experiment for observing the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere in the tropics. To investigate how well the MODIS vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) represented the phenology of different successional stages of naturally regenerating TDFs, within a widely conserved forest fragment in the semi-arid southeast of Brazil, we installed several canopy towers with radiometric sensors to produce high temporal resolution near-surface vegetation greenness indices. Direct comparison of several years of ground measurements with a combined Aqua/Terra 8 day satellite product showed similar broad temporal trends, but MODIS often suffered from cloud contamination during the onset of the growing season and occasionally during the peak growing season. The strength of the in-situ and MODIS linear relationship was greater for NDVI than for EVI across sites but varied with forest stand age. Furthermore, we describe the onset dates and duration of canopy development phases for three years of in-situ monitoring. A seasonality analysis revealed significant discrepancies between tower and MODIS phenology transitions dates, with up to five weeks differences in growing season length estimation. Our results indicate that 8 and 16 day MODIS satellite vegetation monitoring products are suitable for tracking general patterns of tropical dry forest phenology in this region but are not temporally sufficient to characterize inter-annual differences in phenology phase onset dates or changes in productivity due to mid-season droughts. Such rapid transitions in canopy greenness are important indicators of climate change sensitivity of these already endangered forest ecosystems and should be further monitored using both ground and satellite approaches. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific,social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems. © 2017 Borges, Ferreira and Lacerda.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of Sao Paulo / Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries arc not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and processes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are losses in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocessing wastewater and energy.

AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing a growing fire problem driven by climatic change, agricultural expansion and forest degradation. Protected areas are an important feature of forest protection strategies, and sustainable use reserves (SURs) may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management. However, the use of fire in swidden agriculture, and other forms of land management, may be undermining the effectiveness of SURs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals. We analyse MODIS derived hot pixels, TRMM rainfall data, Terra-Class land cover data, socio-ecological data from the Brazilian agro-census and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of SURs reduces fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we ask (1) a. Is SUR location (i.e., de facto) or (1) b. designation (i.e. de jure) the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires?, and (2), Does SUR creation affect fire management (i.e., the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall)? We demonstrate that pre-protection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance. We show that reserve creation had no discernible impact on fire density, and that fires were less prevalent in SURs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness, rather than their status de jure. In addition, the timing of fires in relation to rainfall, indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law, did not improve following SUR creation. These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats. © 2016 Carmenta et al.

AB  - Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand—both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity—because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Tumih / Parepat (Combretocarpus-rotundatus Mig. Dencer) of the family Anisophylleaceae and Meranti (Shorea Belangerang, ShoreaTeysmanniana Dyer ex. Brandis) of Dipterocarpaceae are groups of species of vegetation that is modeled for the designation of its spread. Pioneer species are predicted as an indicator of ecosystem restoration succession of wet tropical peatland characteristic (unique) and very susceptible (fragile) in an endemic Sundaland hotspot. Projected climate change and conservation planning a topic of heated discussion. the analysis of alternative approaches and the development of a combination of search algorithm projection models within the fabric of the diffusion of the species to attain this through a geospatial information system technology.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Around Lubumbashi, the introduction of large-scale pivot-irrigated agriculture entails leveling of large termite mounds during field preparation. The effect on soil fertility and crop yield (Solanum tuberosum and Alium cepa) is evaluated along 11 transects extending from a former termite mound location to reference soil that received no termite mound material. Spreading mound material was found to increase the pH, calcium carbonates CaCO3 content, and the amount of resin-extractable phosphorus (P), other possible effects being undone by fertilizer application. On the other hand, poor physical properties of the mound material seem to have adverse effects on crop production. While the benefits of spreading out mound material seem limited for large-scale farmers with access to fertilizers, the use of mound material may present an opportunity to resource-poor farmers throughout the miombo eco-region, provided that the application of mound materials is optimized and that any adverse effect on soil physical properties can be mitigated. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Reforestation projects have gained interest over recent years due to the loss of biodiversity in tropical regions as a result of large deforestation by anthropogenic actions. However, better knowledge on the tolerance of plant species to environmental stresses is needed for reforestation success. Here, we evaluated the photoprotective and antioxidant capacity, in terms of vitamin E accumulation, of five pioneer (Platypodium elegans Vogel, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil, Cecropia pachystachya Trécul. and Aegiphila sellowiana Cham.) and five non-pioneer (Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemão, Cedrela fissilis Vell., Genipa americana L., Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. and Hymenaea courbaril L.) species, in relation to the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. Furthermore, we examined differences between sun and shade leaves on vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation. Pioneer plants showed on average 33% higher malondialdehyde levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, than non-pioneer species, but no significant differences in vitamin E contents. In contrast, a marked interspecific variation was observed in the levels of α-tocopherol and its precursor, γ-tocopherol. Natural variation revealed interesting relationships between vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. The pioneer species, P. elegans, did not accumulate α-tocopherol and displayed the highest levels of malondialdehyde. Sun and shade leaves accumulated vitamin E levels to a similar extent, except for the pioneer L. pacari and the non-pioneer C. langsdorffii, the former accumulating more α-tocopherol in sun leaves and the latter in shade leaves. We conclude that interspecific variation is higher than both leaf type and successional-group variation in terms of vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation, and that vitamin E levels, particularly those of α-tocopherol, negatively correlate with the extent of lipid peroxidation, thus supporting a photoprotective and antioxidant function for vitamin E in plants growing in tropical environments. © 2016 The Author 2016.

AB  - Indonesian peatland forest is considered a huge sink of tropical carbon and thereby make significant contribution to global terrestrial carbon storage. However, landcover and landuse changes in this ecosystem have incurred a synergistic exposure to drought and wildfires. Deforestation and forest degradation through combustion and decomposition of forest biomass and soil carbon have become global issues because of their greenhouse gas contribution to global climate change. Thus fire-driven carbon losses in these peatlands have increased the need to evaluate the impacts of fire at a landscape scale. In 6–10 week dry periods from January to April 2014 and in January 2015, wildfires burnt peatland forest in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province (Indonesian Borneo). An assessment was conducted to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of fire on aboveground and soil carbon losses and their dynamics in the coastal peatlands of the province. Carbon loss from combustion of both aboveground biomass and peat soil was substantial. Moreover, CO2 emission from soil respiration at the burnt peat surface increased 46% over the first 9 months after the fire. This study clearly showed the magnitude of fire-driven carbon loss and the scale of CO2 emission to the atmosphere arising from fire in tropical peatland forest. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of forestation with leguminous Acacia mearnsii De Wild in native grasslands on the soil greenhouse (GHG) fluxes and their main driving factors. The experiment was conducted in the Brazilian Pampa over the period of one year in a six-year-old Acacia plantation, evaluating four treatments: Acacia (AM), Acacia with litter periodically removed (A-l), Acacia after harvest (AH) and native grassland (NG) (reference treatment). Air samples were obtained by the static chamber method, and gas concentrations were evaluated by gas chromatography. Soil and climate factors were monitored. The accumulated fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were statistically similar between the soils in the AM and NG treatments, which tended to oxidize CH4 (-1445 and -1752 g C-CH4 ha-1 yr-1, respectively) and had low emission of N2O (242 and 316 g N-N2O ha-1 yr-1), most likely influenced by the low water-filled pore space and the low content of mineral N in the soil. However, the soil in the AH treatment presented higher emissions of both gases, totaling 1889 g C-CH4 ha-1 yr-1 and 1250 g N-N2O ha-1 yr-1. Afforestation neither significantly affected the total organic C stocks nor their lability, keeping the C management index for the forested area similar to that in the NG treatment. The conversion from grassland to Acacia forest represents an effective option for mitigating the net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is basically determined by C accumulation in biomass and wood products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We assess whether the implementation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme in the Congo basin has had positive additional impacts - as compared to existing regulatory frameworks applied in noncertified Forest Management Units (FMU) - on (1) the working and living conditions of logging companies' employees and their families, (2) the effectiveness and legitimacy of the institutions and benefit-sharing mechanisms set up to regulate relationships between logging companies and neighbouring communities, and (3) the local populations' rights to and customary uses of forests. Results on (1) and (2) suggest that several significant differences exist between certified and noncertified FMUs. Results are instead mitigated on (3): Companies in certified FMUs tend to better enforce the law, but this may have unwanted negative impacts on customary uses. We discuss the reasons why several positive social outcomes materialised in certified vs. noncertified areas, and suggest possible improvements as well as required further research. © 2017 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To gain an understanding of medication safety culture and other quality issues in a Brazilian intensive care unit using a restorative approach. Background: Patient safety should be considered one of the pillars of quality in health care. Thus, patient safety culture is increasingly being explored as a guide for quality improvement efforts. Design: A qualitative approach. Methods: Participatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration were adapted in this study. This study used focus groups, then subsequent nurse-led photo-narrated walkabouts, and photo elicitation with 23 nurses and one physician in interactive phases of data collection and analysis over an eight-month timeframe. Results: The core themes identified were: the 'medication system shapes patient safety' and the 'feeling of helplessness in the face of the prevailing organization culture'. Participants discussed supports exiting in the intensive care unit that shape medication safety, the barriers that impede safe medication management, the solutions to improve medication safety and the creation of a better medication safety culture. Conclusions: The methods used allowed participants to visualise sound practices as well as key safety issues, reflect on their day-to-day work, re-think potential improvements, and enact changes to improve medication safety and medication safety culture. However, the patient safety culture is also marked by administrative pressure. The hospital needs to adopt participatory management, where the health professionals can act together with the organisational leaders to promote a just culture. Relevance to clinical practice: The participatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration provided participants with a tool to promote patient safety culture and engage policy change dialogue. However, it will be important in future restorative research to track-specific safety outcomes over time to assess the cost-benefit of the adoption of participatory management models.

AB  - We provide the first assessment of tropical peatland depth of burn (DoB) using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, applied to imagery collected using a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system operated over a 5.2 ha tropical peatland in Jambi Province on Sumatra, Indonesia. Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (±1σ) DoB of 0.23 ± 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 ± 29 t·C·ha-1 for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDAR-albeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Soil provides many ecosystem services that are essential to maintain its quality and healthy development of the flora, fauna and human well-being. Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State – Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgCl2) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg−1 dry weight. Results indicate that the Hg toxicity is higher under increased conditions of moisture, significantly affecting survival and reproduction rate. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide, but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity. Here, we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the Brazilian Forest Code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of southeastern Brazil. We gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2,408 rural properties, totalizing 748,601 ha of farmlands within the Atlantic Forest biome and its ecotone with Cerrado, two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Together, rural properties account for 50,783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs). On the basis of this, we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within APPs, as determined by the Forest Code. The simulation of restoration at the property-level resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches, reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size. At the sugarcane mill level, the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity. Despite these benefits, final forest cover (remnant plus restored forests) would still be reduced (<20%—the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law) in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation. The mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in human-modified tropical landscapes, but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The present study aimed to apply geostatistics to characterise spatial variability of chemical soil properties in a homogeneous teak stand. We plotted 91 samples in an area of 467 ha, sampling the soil at 0-20 cm depth for modelling spatial patterns of soil properties by semivariograms, interpolating and spatialising data by the ordinary point kriging method. Spatial variability of chemical soil properties varied in the area and can be precisely and efficiently modelled by geostatistics. We generated thematic maps for soil properties which were able to identify zones with nutritional deficiencies for teak, according to the recommended levels for the species. Evaluation of the site quality index according to the dominant height of trees revealed that the better site indices were in areas with higher concentrations of calcium and pH. Geostatistics proved to be suitable for the definition of homogeneous strata in teak stands. It can be used as an alternative method to regulate natural soil fertility in function of physiological requirements of the species, leading to a balanced input usage by forest producers and mitigation of environmental impacts. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Estimates are that in Brazil there are about 180 million hectares of pasturelands, 70% with some degree of degradation. Reclamation of such areas demands re-establishment of soil fertility, plant growth and forage production, and microbial inoculants might help in these processes. We evaluated the ability of two strains of Azospirillum brasilense to promote the growth of two genotypes of Brachiaria spp. (=Urochloa spp.). The experiments were set up at three different sites in Brazil, and forage production estimated for 26 cuts in two years. On average, increases of 5.4% and 22.1% in response to N-fertilizer alone and to N-fertilizer in combination with Azospirillum, respectively, were observed over the non-inoculated and non-N-fertilized control treatment. Increase in N accumulation in the biomass in response to Azospirillum was equivalent to a second application of 40 kg of N-fertilizer ha-1. Estimates attributed to the inoculation were of gains of 0.103 Mg C ha-1, corresponding to 0.309 Mg CO2-eq ha-1. Inoculation with Azospirillum may represent a key component of programs to reclaim degraded pastures and help sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents and discusses the main findings of a study focusing on climate change mitigation actions (MAs) in Brazil. Brazilian government presented to the 15th Conference of the Parties of the Climate Change Convention held in Copenhagen in 2009 (UNFCCC COP15) voluntary mitigation goals: a reduction in between 36.1 and 38.9% of the country's green house gases (GHG) emissions projected to 2020. If Brazil meets its voluntary goals, its GHG emissions in 2020 will be 6-10% lower than in 2005. The main research question addressed in this study is what conditions should Brazil meet to achieve its pledge? It discusses how MAs are approached, conceptualized and planned in Brazil. It describes how the country identifies MAs and the contextual framework used to define them. It also maps the initiatives underway in the country, and analyses the issues faced for its successful implementation, as well as for future approaches. The main conclusion is that Brazil seems to be in a good position to meet its voluntary mitigation goals up to 2020, as avoiding deforestation will take up the bulk of the emission reduction. After 2020, Brazil will face a new challenge: combine economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Contemporary conservation interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation. © 2014 by the author(s). Published here under license by the Resilience Alliance.

AB  - To investigate the characteristics of gas emissions from a tropical peatland fire, ground-level measurement of fire-generated gases was conducted during a large fire event in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2009. Concentrations of CO and CH4 showed positive linear correlations with that of CO2. The relationship between concentrations of N2O and CO2 were divided into two parts, suggesting the influence of additional N2O generation during sample storage. The CO2-normalized emission ratio was calculated for CO, CH4, and N2O. The molar ratio of these fire-generated gas emissions was summarized as CO2:CO:CH4:N2O=1.00:0.382:0.0261:0.000156, whereas the emission ratio calculated on the global warming potential (GWP) basis was CO2:CH4:N2O=1.00:0.237:0.0465. The GWP emission based on this ratio was 87.8-91.2% of a simple evaluation in which all carbon was assumed to be emitted as CO2. This is the first trial to evaluate the emission ratios of major greenhouse gases on the basis of ground-level observation during an actual tropical peatland fire. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in water conservation yet forest plantations are considered detrimental because of their high water use. The current worldwide trends of reduction in natural forest and expansion of forest plantations increases the need for forest managers to contribute to water conservation, implementing management plans that integrate economic (productivity and growth), social (equity of access to water and land-use conflicts) and environmental (climate change and biodiversity impacts) factors. In this paper, we show examples of forest management alternatives at macro- and meso-scales that could contribute to improve water conservation in forest plantation landscapes. At the macroscale, we assess water use in different forest plantation areas in Brazil by analyzing the theoretical thresholds for the management of evapotranspiration. Then, using data from an experimental catchment, we modeled water yield reduction by a forest plantation over multiple years and assessed how different meso-scale forest plantation management alternatives affected water flow regulation. Results show that at a macroscale it is important to consider the natural climatic constraints of water availability. Evidence shows that forest plantations in the tropics use water according to its availability, and the appropriate choice of species/varieties and associated forest management options are crucial for water conservation. At the meso-scale we found that the proportion of native forest plays an important role in the reduction and regulation of water use, and therefore a system of mosaic management may be able to stabilize water flow across plantation landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Englund et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 044002) have recently analyzed biodiesel production from oil palm plantations as one possible way to mitigate climate change while providing cost effective results. They show that data for detailed quantification of biological carbon sequestration is available allowing a high confidence evaluation of positive impacts when oil palm plantation for food and biodiesel production is carried out in degraded, cultivated soil, and also with some varieties of natural vegetation in the Amazon. Nevertheless, economic risk associated with the future price of fossil fuels and uncertainties related with carbon subsidy are barriers. Here we discuss the assumptions under which such controversial proposal is based and suggest further analysis for Brazilian decision makers. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate change mitigation mechanisms, such as REDD+, which aim at avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, require an accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring. In the present study, multi-temporal X-(TerraSAR-X) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) SAR data and a multispectral RapidEye image were analyzed for their ability to estimate AGB in a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo, Indonesia. Field inventory AGB data was used to calibrate regression models based on SAR backscatter values and spectral unmixed fractions of the RapidEye image. The independent validation indicated that the estimated AGB using optical data is more accurate (RMSE=44%) than the SAR estimated AGB (RMSE=82%). AGB derived from RapidEye data overestimates AGB on burned areas, but these estimations depict degradation through low impact selective logging. The SAR model estimated AGB accurately in lower biomass ranges and on burned scars. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Biochar is the product of incomplete combustion (pyrolysis) of organic material. In rural areas, it can be used as a soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Fuel-constrained villagers may however prefer to use biochar briquettes as a higher-value fuel for cooking over applying it to soils. A systems-oriented analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted to analyze these two alternative uses of biochar, applying the study to a rural village system in Indonesia. The results showed soil amendment for enhanced agricultural production to be the preferential choice with a positive benefit to the baseline scenario of -26 ecopoints (LCA) and -173 USD (CBA) annually pr. household. In this case, the positive effects of carbon sequestration to the soil and the economic value of the increased agricultural production outweighed the negative environmental impacts from biochar production and the related production costs. Use of biochar in briquettes for cooking fuel yielded negative net effects in both the LCA and CBA (85 ecopoints and 176 USD), even when positive health effects from reduced indoor air pollution were included. The main reasons for this are that emissions during biochar production are not compensated by carbon sequestration and that briquette making is labor-intensive. The results emphasize the importance of investigating and documenting the carbon storage effect and the agricultural benefit in biochar production-utilization systems for a sustainable use. Further research focus on efficient production is necessary due to the large environmental impact of biochar production. In addition, biochar should continue to be used in those soils where the agricultural effect is most beneficial. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha−1 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha−1 in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha−1 in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha−1 in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Key message: We compiled 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies in Indonesia. Unpublished academic theses contributed the largest share of the biomass equations. The availability of the biomass equations was skewed to certain regions, forest types, and species. Further research is necessary to fill the data gaps in emission factors and to enhance the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs. Context: Locally derived allometric equations contribute to reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of biomass, which may be useful in the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs in the forestry sector. Many regional and global efforts are underway to compile allometric equations. Aims: The present study compiles the available allometric equations in Indonesia and evaluates their adequacy in estimating biomass in the different types of forest across the archipelago. Methods: A systematic survey of the scientific literature was conducted to compile the biomass equations, including ISI publications, national journals, conference proceedings, scientific reports, and academic theses. The data collected were overlaid on a land use/land cover map to assess the spatial distribution with respect to different regions and land cover types. The validation of the equations for selected forest types was carried out using independent destructive sampling data. Results: A total of 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies were compiled. Unpublished academic theses contributed the majority of the biomass equations. Twenty-one habitat types and 65 species were studied in detail. Diameter was the most widely used single predictor in all allometric equations. The cumulative number of individual trees cut was 5,207. The islands of Java, Kalimantan, and Sumatra were the most studied, while other regions were underexplored or unexplored. More than half of the biomass equations were for just seven species. The majority of the studies were carried out in plantation forests and secondary forests, while primary forests remain largely understudied. Validation using independent data showed that the allometric models for peat swamp forest had lower error departure, while the models for lowland dipterocarp forest had higher error departure. Conclusion: Although biomass studies are a major research activity in Indonesia due to its high forest cover, the majority of such activities are limited to certain regions, forest types, and species. More research is required to cover underrepresented regions, forest types, particular growth forms, and very large tree diameter classes. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Central Africa includes the world's second largest rainforest block. The ecology of the region remains poorly understood, as does its vegetation and archaeological history. However, over the past 20 years, multidisciplinary scientific programmes have enhanced knowledge of old human presence and palaeoenvironments in the forestry block of Central Africa. This first regional synthesis documents significant cultural changes over the past five millennia and describes how they are linked to climate. It is now well documented that climatic conditions in the African tropics underwent significant changes throughout this period and here we demonstrate that corresponding shifts in human demography have had a strong influence on the forests. The most influential event was the decline of the strong African monsoon in the Late Holocene, resulting in serious disturbance of the forest block around 3500 BP. During the same period, populations from the north settled in the forest zone; they mastered new technologies such as pottery and fabrication of polished stone tools, and seem to have practised agriculture. The opening up of forests from 2500 BP favoured the arrival of metallurgist populations that impacted the forest. During this long period (2500-1400 BP), a remarkable increase of archaeological sites is an indication of a demographic explosion of metallurgist populations. Paradoxically, we have found evidence of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) cultivation in the forest around 2200 BP, implying a more arid context. While Early Iron Age sites (prior to 1400 BP) and recent pre-colonial sites (two to eight centuries BP) are abundant, the period between 1600 and 1000 BP is characterized by a sharp decrease in human settlements, with a population crash between 1300 and 1000 BP over a large part of Central Africa. It is only in the eleventh century that new populations of metallurgists settled into the forest block. In this paper, we analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of 328 archaeological sites that have been reliably radiocarbon dated. The results allow us to piece together changes in the relationships between human populations and the environments in which they lived. On this basis, we discuss interactions between humans, climate and vegetation during the past five millennia and the implications of the absence of people from the landscape over three centuries. We go on to discuss modern vegetation patterns and African forest conservation in the light of these events. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Implementation of forest restoration projects requires cross-scale and hybrid forms of governance involving the state, the market, civil society, individuals, communities, and other actors. Using a case study from the Atlantic Forest Hotspot, we examine the governance of a large-scale forest restoration project implemented by an international non-governmental organization (NGO) on family farmer landholdings located within protected areas of sustainable development. In addition to forest restoration, the project aims to provide an economic benefit to participating farmers by including native species with market potential (fruits, timber) in restoration models and by contracting farmers in the planting phase. We employed qualitative methods such as structured interviews and participant observation to assess the effect of environmental policy and multi-scalar governance on implementation and acceptability of the project by farmers. We demonstrate that NGO and farmer expectations for the project were initially misaligned, hampering farmer participation. Furthermore, current policy complicated implementation and still poses barriers to project success, and projects must remain adaptable to changing legal landscapes. We recommend increased incorporation of social science methods in earlier stages of projects, as well as throughout the course of implementation, in order to better assess the needs and perspectives of participants, as well as to minimize trade-offs. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate group according to the IUCN. Land-use and land cover change (LULCC) and climate change (CC) are two of the main factors related to declining amphibian populations. Given the vulnerability of threatened and rare species, the study of their response to these impacts is a conservation priority. The aim of this work was to analyze the combined impact of LULCC and CC on the regionally endemic species Melanophryniscus sanmartini Klappenbach, 1968. This species is currently categorized as near threatened by the IUCN, and previous studies suggest negative effects of projected changes in climate. Using maximum entropy methods we modeled the effects of CC on the current and mid-century distribution of M. sanmartini under two IPCC scenarios – A2 (severe) and B2 (moderate). The effects of LULCC were studied by superimposing the potential distribution with current land use, while future distribution models were evaluated under the scenario of maximum expansion of soybean and afforestation in Uruguay. The results suggest that M. sanmartini is distributed in eastern Uruguay and the south of Brazil, mainly related to hilly and grasslands systems. Currently more than 10% of this species’ distribution is superimposed by agricultural crops and exotic forest plantations. Contrasting with a recent modelling study our models suggest an expansion of the distribution of M. sanmartini by mid-century under both climate scenarios. However, despite the rise in climatically suitable areas for the species in the future, LULCC projections indicate that the proportion of modified habitats will occupy up to 25% of the distribution of M. sanmartini. Future change in climate conditions could represent an opportunity for M. sanmartini, but management measures are needed to mitigate the effects of habitat modification in order to ensure its survival and allow the eventual expansion of its distribution. © 2015, Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - Increases in carbon (C) input and stabilization are key processes to turn soils into sinks of atmospheric CO2-C and help mitigating global warming. We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8Mgha-1, P<0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8Mgha-1, P<0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25Mgha-1 in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18Mgha-1 in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0Mgha-1 year-1) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C. In NT, most of the C accumulation relative to CT occurred in the mineral-associated fraction, showing the importance of organo-mineral interaction in C stabilization and supporting our second hypothesis. However, the physical protection by aggregates played equally important role by stabilizing the occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) before it was further stabilized by organo-mineral interaction. No-tillage is recommended as a sustainable soil management, but to increase soil C accumulation, the potential of cropping systems such those based on legume cover crops must be concurrently explored. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, it was conducted a study of occupational risk assessment during the construction of confined spaces in a brewery, located in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, where confined environments have been built to meet the discharge of malt, to serve as a reuse box passage of water and wastewater. Among the methodological aspects used in this work, we highlight the use of a management tool consisting of the GUT matrix (severity, urgency, tendency) for prioritization of specific risks by activity. It has been observed that the risks have been classified as accidents, were the predominant both in transport activities and preparation of materials, as in digging activities by machines and manual excavation and containment. Thus, these agents are the risks that require prioritization of implementation of mitigation measures and correction. Therefore, a special attention should be given to: signaling work, traffic allowed by the ape-adequate access, respect to the speed limits and beeps, driving machinery and equipment only by a qualified professional, obedience to safety procedures on the construction site and others. It was observed that biological risk were those who required lesser relevance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - In Brazil, more than 99% of malaria cases are reported in the Amazon, and the State of Amazonas accounts for 40% of this total. However, the accumulated experience and challenges in controlling malaria in this region in recent decades have not been reported. Throughout the fi rst economic cycle during the rubber boom (1879 to 1912), malaria was recorded in the entire state, with the highest incidence in the villages near the Madeira River in the Southern part of the State of Amazonas. In the 1970s, during the second economic development cycle, the economy turned to the industrial sector and demanded a large labor force, resulting in a large migratory infl ux to the capital Manaus. Over time, a gradual increase in malaria transmission was observed in peri-urban areas. In the 1990s, the stimulation of agroforestry, particularly fi sh farming, led to the formation of permanent Anopheline breeding sites and increased malaria in settlements. The estimation of environmental impacts and the planning of measures to mitigate them, as seen in the construction of the Coari-Manaus gas pipeline, proved effective. Considering the changes occurred since the Amsterdam Conference in 1992, disease control has been based on early diagnosis and treatment, but the development of parasites that are resistant to major antimalarial drugs in Brazilian Amazon has posed a new challenge. Despite the decreased lethality and the gradual decrease in the number of malaria cases, disease elimination, which should be associated with government programs for economic development in the region, continues to be a challenge. ©  2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - This research was conducted in the city of Pocon&#233;, Mato Grosso, in the stream Tereza Botas watershed, consisting in the evaluation of susceptibility to erosion and danger in it. Performed according to the methodology of Verah method, with emphasis on erosion. It was possible to identify the different types of soils in the area, as well as the different susceptibility classes, namely class II (very susceptible) and V (Little by not susceptible). Class II (very susceptible) consists of soil with complex conservation problems, characterized by having shallow and medium depths, and low fertility. These are lands unsuitable for crops, but adapted for grazing and / or reforestation. Class V (Little by Not Susceptible) consists of soils without serious conservation problems, but it is necessary to adopt special techniques conservationism. They are characterized by having shallow and poorly drained soils with slopes less than 3.0[%] not susceptible to erosion. Once the watershed under study presents low slope indexes, however silting of the channel studied is directly related to the laminar erosion due to mining activities took place in the town, which is responsible for the deviations made in the stream Tereza Boots as well as numerous landscape changes and soil movements arising from anthropogenic activities in the locality. © 2015, Universidade Estadual Paulista.

AB  - Abstract Brazil is one of the largest producers of eucalyptus that is used for manufacturing pulp and paper; this contributes directly to the issue of carbon emissions. Reforestation of eucalyptus appears as a viable alternative for mitigating these carbon emissions, leveraging their high productivity to that of other leading countries in the market, such as Finland and Sweden. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring and evaluating forest growth and quantifying wood stocks and sequestered carbon. System dynamics was used to simulate forest growth. Forest growth was modeled from eight regions with dissimilar edaphoclimatic characteristics, in the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The model was sensitive enough to the characteristics of the regions, where the difference in forest stocks was 45.1% at the end of 30 years in a harvest cycle of 7 years. It was found that the typical harvest cycle in practice by leading companies did not always yield a higher sequestered CO2 accumulated stock. By shortening the harvest cycle, it was possible to obtain a gain of up to 21.0% in the sequestered CO2 stock. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of fig trees in tropical ecosystems is evidenced by the great diversity (+750 species) and wide geographic distribution of the genus. We assessed the contribution of environmental variables on the species richness and density of fig trees in fragments of seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) in Brazil. We assessed 20 forest fragments in three regions in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Fig tree richness and density was estimated in rectangular plots, comprising 31.4ha sampled. Both richness and fig tree density were linearly modeled as function of variables representing (1) fragment metrics, (2) forest structure, and (3) landscape metrics expressing water drainage in the fragments. Model selection was performed by comparing the AIC values (Akaike Information Criterion) and the relative weight of each model (wAIC). Both species richness and fig tree density were better explained by the water availability in the fragment (meter of streams/ha): wAICrichness=0.45, wAICdensity=0.96. The remaining variables related to anthropic perturbation and forest structure were of little weight in the models. The rainfall seasonality in SSF seems to select for both establishment strategies and morphological adaptations in the hemiepiphytic fig tree species. In the studied SSF, hemiepiphytes established at lower heights in their host trees than reported for fig trees in evergreen rainforests. Some hemiepiphytic fig species evolved superficial roots extending up to 100m from their trunks, resulting in hectare-scale root zones that allow them to efficiently forage water and soil nutrients. The community of fig trees was robust to variation inforest structure and conservation level of SSF fragments, making this group of plants an important element for the functioning of seasonal tropical forests. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Macrophyte net primary productivity (NPP) is a significant but understudied component of the carbon budget in large Amazonian floodplains. Annual NPP is determined by the interaction between stem elongation (vertical growth) and plant cover changes (horizontal expansion), each affected differently by flood duration and amplitude. Therefore, hydrological changes as predicted for the Amazon basin could result in significant changes in annual macrophyte NPP. This study investigates the responses of macrophyte horizontal expansion and vertical growth to flooding variability, and its possible effects on the contribution of macrophytes to the carbon budget of Amazonian floodplains. Monthly macrophyte cover was estimated using satellite imagery for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 hydrological years, and biomass was measured in situ between 2003 and 2004. Regression models between macrophyte variables and river-stage data were used to build a semiempirical model of macrophyte NPP as a function of water level. Historical river-stage records (1970-2011) were used to simulate variations in NPP, as a function of annual flooding. Vertical growth varied by a factor of ca. 2 over the simulated years, whereas minimum and maximum annual cover varied by ca. 3.5 and 1.5, respectively. Results suggest that these processes act in opposite directions to determine macrophyte NPP, with larger sensitivity to changes in vertical growth, and thus maximum flooding levels. Years with uncommonly large flooding amplitude resulted in the highest NPP values, as both horizontal expansion and vertical growth were enhanced under these conditions. Over the simulated period, annual NPP varied by ca. 1.5 (1.06-1.63 TgC yr-1). A small increasing trend in flooding amplitude, and by extension NPP, was observed for the studied period. Variability in growth rates caused by local biotic and abiotic factors, and the lack of knowledge on macrophyte physiological responses to extreme hydrological conditions remain the major sources of uncertainty. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGBdry) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70±7.3Mgha-1) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67±8.7Mgha-1). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work presents indicators to assess the conservation status of forest patches in fragmented landscapes. However, how can we evaluate the conservation status of forest patches in order to compare it to a hypothetical situation of well-preserved vegetation without human disturbance? It is possible to measure some ecological processes, like nutrient cycling, canopy, edaphic, topographic and hydrological parameters, as well as landscape attributes, and associate them to conservation status. When the attributes of original well-preserved forest are unknown because they are seldom found, it is possible to compare patches by assessing the variability of their attributes. To this end, parameters related to canopy, soil, topography and landscape were analyzed to establish indicators and their integrated analysis was developed to assess the conservation status of forest patches and identify possible causes of shortcomings or obstacles to reach the conservation status. The study area is located in a Semidecidual Forest region, in Brazil. The methodology was developed considering plots distributed in sites within forest patches. The results allowed the identification of patches in different conditions of conservation and provided information of the factors that contribute to this status, in order to help guide and select the most appropriate measures to mitigate degradation and identify forest conservation strategies. © 2016, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Studies dealing with the reconstruction of Holocene climate change of tropical areas are scarce. Of these, multi-proxy investigations using peatlands are still absent. In this paper, we present the Holocene record of environmental changes in central-eastern Brazil reconstructed from a core sampled in Pau de Fruta mire (Serra do Espinhaço Meridional, Brazil). We combined palynological and geochemical analyses, supported by core stratigraphy, 14C dating and multivariate statistics. The location of the mire is ideal because it is in an area which is directly associated with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Six main phases of change suggested by vegetation and local and regional landscape dynamics were described. In phase I (~10,000-7360cal. yr BP) the climate was very wet and cold and was accompanied by soil instability in the mire catchment (severe local erosion) and the 8.2ka event was easily recognizable by a large increase in the deposition of regional dust. Phase II (~7360-4200cal. yr BP) was characterized by wet and warm conditions, catchment soil stability and enhanced deposition of regional dust. In phase III (~4200-2200cal. yr BP), climate was dry and warm and soil erosion in the catchment increased again. In phase IV (~2200-1160cal. yr BP) dry and punctuated cooling was reconstructed, together with enhanced deposition of regional dust. Phase V (~1160-400cal. yr BP) reflects sub-humid climatic conditions (like the current climate), the lowest inputs of local and regional dust and the largest accumulation of peat in the mire. While in phase VI (< ~400cal. yr BP) sub-humid conditions continued but both local and regional erosion significantly increased. Our results demonstrate that the tropical peatlands of Serra do Espinhaço Meridional contain relevant records of Holocene climate changes, and that a multi-proxy approach offers good opportunities for a detailed reconstruction of palaeoenvironments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The composting process is a viable alternative for the recycling of household organic waste and sewage sludge generated during wastewater treatment. However, this technique can select microorganisms resistant to antimicrobials and heavy metals as a result of excess chemicals present in compost windrow. This study evaluates the antimicrobial multiresistant and tolerance to heavy metals in bacteria isolated from the composting process with sewage sludge. Fourteen antimicrobials were used in 344 strains for the resistance profile and four heavy metals (chromium, copper, zinc, and lead) for the minimum biocide concentration assay. The strains used were from the sewage sludge sample (beginning of the process) and the compost sample (end of the process). Strains with higher antimicrobial and heavy metal profile were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed a multiresistant profile in 48 % of the strains, with the highest percentage of strains resistant to nitrofurantoin (65 %) and β-lactams (58 %). The strains isolated from the sewage sludge and the end of the composting process were more tolerant to copper, with a lethal dose of approximately 900 mg L−1 for about 50 % of the strains. The genera that showed the highest multiresistant profile and increased tolerance to the metals tested were Pseudomonas and Ochrobactrum. The results of this study may contribute to future research and the revision and regulation of legislation on sewage sludge reuse in soils. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Biofuels' potential supply is uncertain. This uncertainty involves not only the possibility of expanding bio-energetic cultures in the medium term but also the risk of supply disruptions in the short term. These supply disruptions may be mainly caused by climatic conditions, soil management, plagues and diseases, Global Climatic Change (GCC), producers' strategies and other factors. An ethanol supply shock may force the petroleum refining industry to increase its gasoline output or result in an increase in liquid fuel imports. An intersection of both alternatives may also be a solution. This study developed and applied a methodology to evaluate the capacity of petroleum refineries to address unforeseen ethanol supply deficits in the short term. The tool utilized was a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The methodology was applied to Brazilian refineries system. Findings show that to build catalytic reforming (CR) units to produced additional gasoline volumes during unexpected ethanol supply shortage is not economically attractive. However, these investments can be justified when the probability of ethanol supply loss is high. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A key issue in global conservation is how biodiversity co-benefits can be incorporated into land use and climate change mitigation activities, particularly those being negotiated under the United Nations to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation. Protected areas have been the dominant strategy for tropical forest conservation and they have increased substantially in recent decades. Avoiding deforestation by preserving carbon stored in vegetation between protected areas provides an opportunity to mitigate the effects of land use and climate change on biodiversity by maintaining habitat connectivity across landscapes. Here we use a high-resolution data set of vegetation carbon stock to map corridors traversing areas of highest biomass between protected areas in the tropics. The derived corridors contain 15% of the total unprotected aboveground carbon in the tropical region. A large number of corridors have carbon densities that approach or exceed those of the protected areas they connect, suggesting these are suitable areas for achieving both habitat connectivity and climate change mitigation benefits. To further illustrate how economic and biological information can be used for corridor prioritization on a regional scale, we conducted a multicriteria analysis of corridors in the Legal Amazon, identifying corridors with high carbon, high species richness and endemism, and low economic opportunity costs. We also assessed the vulnerability of corridors to future deforestation threat. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo/Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and processes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are losses in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocessing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested.

AB  - The steel industry is under pressure to reduce its CO2 emissions, which arise from the use of coal. In the long-term, the injection of pulverized particles of charcoal from biomass through blast furnace tuyeres, in this case called Bio-PCI, is an attractive method from both an environmental and metallurgical viewpoint. The potential of Bio-PCI has been assessed in terms of its CO2 abatement potential and economic viewpoint. A cost objective function has been used to measure the impact of biochar substitution in highly fuel-efficient BF among the top nine hot metal producers; estimations are based on the relevant cost determinants of ironmaking. This contribution aims to shed light on two strategic questions: Under what conditions is the implementation of Bio-PCI economically attractive? Additionally, where is such a techno-economic innovation likely to be taken up the earliest? The results indicate the potential for an 18-40% mitigation of CO2. Findings from the economic assessment show that biochar cannot compete with fossil coal on price alone; therefore, a lower cost of biochar or the introduction of carbon taxes will be necessary to increase the competitiveness of Bio-PCI. Based on the current prices of raw materials, electricity and carbon taxes, biochar should be between 130.1 and 236.4 USD/t and carbon taxes should be between 47.1 and 198.7 USD/t CO2 to facilitate the substitution of Bio-PCI in the examined countries. In regard to implementation, Brazil, followed by India, China and the USA appeared to be in a better position to deploy Bio-PCI. © 2014 Brazilian Metallurgical, Materials and Mining Association.

AB  - Background: Large-scale forest conservation projects are underway in the Brazilian Amazon but little is known regarding their public health impact. Current literature emphasizes how land clearing increases malaria incidence, leading to the conclusion that forest conservation decreases malaria burden. Yet, there is also evidence that proximity to forest fringes increases malaria incidence, which implies the opposite relationship between forest conservation and malaria. We compare the effect of these environmental factors on malaria and explore its implications. Methods and Findings: Using a large malaria dataset (~1,300,000 positive malaria tests collected over ~4.5 million km2), satellite imagery, permutation tests, and hierarchical Bayesian regressions, we show that greater forest cover (as a proxy for proximity to forest fringes) tends to be associated with higher malaria incidence, and that forest cover effect was 25 times greater than the land clearing effect, the often cited culprit of malaria in the region. These findings have important implications for land use/land cover (LULC) policies in the region. We find that cities close to protected areas (PA's) tend to have higher malaria incidence than cities far from PA's. Using future LULC scenarios, we show that avoiding 10% of deforestation through better governance might result in an average 2-fold increase in malaria incidence by 2050 in urban health posts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cost analysis of reduced carbon emissions from conservation efforts in the region should account for increased malaria morbidity, and that conservation initiatives should consider adopting malaria mitigation strategies. Coordinated actions from disparate science fields, government ministries, and global initiatives (e.g., Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation; Millenium Development Goals; Roll Back Malaria; and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), will be required to decrease malaria toll in the region while preserving these important ecosystems. © 2013 Valle, Clark.

AB  - Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5. ×. 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10. cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guinea-grass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large differences in productivity have been observed between neighboring Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, that cannot be explained by climate and are unlikely to be due solely to altered management practices. Current ecophysiological models used by forestry companies to simulate stand development in large plantation zones rely on empirical site fertility indices (representing water and nutrient availability) to capture this spatial variability in growth rates. We propose a model that requires no empirical assessment of site fertility to simulate stand growth over entire rotations. We applied a modified version of the G'DAY model of carbon, nitrogen and water cycling at a daily time step to short-rotation plantations located in São Paulo State, including a simple mechanistic description of the effect of water availability on growth. The progressive and rapid root exploration of deep soil layers was modeled in a simple way, by considering that maximum plant available water increased with mean tree height. The model was parameterized using detailed measurements made over the entire rotation of an experimental stand of Eucalyptus grandis, and was subsequently applied to 16 clonal stands managed in a similar way by one company, but with different planting dates and contrasting productivity levels. Stem biomass simulations, driven by daily weather data (maximum and minimum air temperatures, global radiation and rainfall), were strongly correlated with company inventory estimates of stem biomass carried out at different ages. The temporal variation of leaf area index was also adequately simulated, as was shown by comparison with leaf area index derived from satellite data. The model was able to capture more than 95% of the variability of standing stem biomass and more than 85% of the variability of stem growth measured on these stands, provided spatial differences in soil water holding capacity were taken into account. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human impacts on natural tropical forests in Central Africa are to a large extent linked to shifting cultivation and fuelwood extraction in peri-urban areas. This is especially true around the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is why research was conducted in 2010 by the Makala Project in the city's fuelwood supply basin. The aims were to adapt and test Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), improve slash-andburn crop systems and contribute to the enrichment of forest fallows. Prior to slashing and burning, useful trees were selected for protection. Then, during cropping, the germination and multiplication of stump shoots and root suckers from existing local forest species were promoted by selective weeding, thinning, and pruning. Monitoring of the test areas found low survival rates for old trees conserved before the land was slashed and burned, due to the difficulty of controlling the fires. This means that the technique can only be used for the edges of plots, by gradually enriching hedgerows. In contrast, stumps shoots and root suckers from natural forest species protected by ANR during agricultural weeding grew rapidly inside the plots, thus rapidly establishing woody fallows without the need for costly inputs or heavy labour. In 2014, three and a half years after slashing and burning, biodiversity and biomass in these fallows is greater than in non-ANR fallows. Better charcoal and crop productivity and a slower rate of forest transition into savannah are expected. However, social acceptance, a critical factor in the large-scale dissemination of this innovation, must be investigated in the light of potential developments in traditional and modern land tenure rights.

AB  - Trees behave in different ways on microclimate due to mainly distinct features of each species and planting strategies especially in the tropics. This paper quantifies the daily and seasonal microclimate behavior of various tree species with different planting design either individual or in clusters. This specific knowledge is an important step in the development of urban design guidelines based on the shading of trees and climate adaptation in urban areas in the tropics. It focuses on human thermal comfort based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) for different species. Twelve species were analyzed: Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex A.DC.) Mattos, Jacaranda mimosaefolia D. Don., Syzygium cumini L., Mangifera indica L., Pinus palustris L., Pinus coulteri L.; Lafoensia glyptocarpa L., Caesalpinia pluviosa F., Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv., Tipuana tipu F., Delonix indica F. and Senna siamea L. The results show that shading of trees can influence significantly human thermal comfort expressed by (PET). The species C. pluviosa F. presents the best possibility in terms of PET because it can reduce between 12 and 16. °C for individual trees cluster can reduce between 12.5 and 14.5. °C. Appropriate vegetation used for shading public and private areas is essential to mitigate heat stress and can create better human thermal comfort especially in cities. The results can be seen as a possibility of improvement of outdoor thermal comfort conditions and as an important step in order to achieve sustainability in cities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landscape approaches are widely applied in attempts to reconcile tradeoffs amongst different actors with conflicting demands on land and water resources. Key principles for landscape approaches have been endorsed by inter-governmental processes dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation. We review experiences from seven landscapes located in the Congo Basin, Eastern Indonesia and Northern Australia. Landscape initiatives were applied in situations where large-scale extractive industries, local peoples’ livelihoods and global biodiversity objectives were in conflict. We found that common published principles for landscape approaches are not applied systematically in the areas studied. Practitioners draw upon landscape approach principles selectively and adapt them to deal with local conditions. We consider that landscape approaches do not provide silver bullet solutions to these situations nor do they provide an operational framework for large-scale land management. Landscape approaches do, however, provide an organising framework for disentangling the complexity of the landscape and facilitating the investigation of impacts of different courses of action. They enable alternative scenarios for what future landscapes might look like to be investigated and they create the space for multi-stakeholder negotiations. Outcomes from landscape scale approaches are determined by the power differentials amongst stakeholders and the existence, or otherwise, of functional institutions to take decisions and enforce agreements. Landscape approaches cannot overcome disparities in power or entrenched interests nor can they substitute for institutions with authority to establish and legitimise property and resource rights. They can, however, provide a mechanism around which civil society can be mobilised to achieve better land use outcomes. Landscape approaches are successful when they have strong leadership, sustained long-term and facilitated processes, good governance, adequate budgets and adequate metrics for assessing progress. Private sector engagement is necessary and all parties must have sufficient shared interest in outcomes to motivate their participation. © 2014, Springer Japan.

AB  - The marine aquarium trade has played an important role in shaping the ecological state of coral reefs in Indonesia and much of the Asia-Pacific. The use of cyanide by ornamental fishers in Buleleng District, Bali, in the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a precipitous decline in the ecological health of reefs. Cyanide-free harvesting techniques were introduced after 2000, along with reef restoration measures. This paper examines social and ecological processes in the fishing village of Les, Bali, in ending the use of cyanide and the resulting ecological restoration. An emphasis on conservation-development (with livelihood objectives) was important in securing interest and cooperation across stakeholder groups. Adaptive approaches to governance and knowledge co-production were also important. The strategy used at Les is now being exported to other communities across Indonesia, and provides a promising example of a marine resources-based conservation-development initiative that may be implemented at other, similar communities. © content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

AB  - Climate change and rapidly escalating global demand for food, fuel, fibre and feed present seemingly contradictory challenges to humanity. Can greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use, more than one-fourth of the global total, decline as growth in land-based production accelerates? This review examines the status of two major international initiatives that are designed to address different aspects of this challenge. REDD+ is an emerging policy framework for providing incentives to tropical nations and states that reduce their GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Market transformation, best represented by agricultural commodity roundtables, seeks to exclude unsustainable farmers from commodity markets through international social and environmental standards for farmers and processors. These global initiatives could potentially become synergistically integrated through (i) a shared approach for measuring and favouring high environmental and social performance of land use across entire jurisdictions and (ii) stronger links with the domestic policies, finance and laws in the jurisdictions where agricultural expansion is moving into forests. To achieve scale, the principles of REDD+ and sustainable farming systems must be embedded in domestic low-emission rural development models capable of garnering support across multiple constituencies. We illustrate this potential with the case of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phlebotomine vectors transmit parasites and can cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or cutaneous leishmaniasis (TL). Phlebotomine females are hematophagous but need to ingest carbohydrates, possibly promoting the development of protozoan parasites in their digestive tract. The present study evaluated the species composition and abundance across several habitats in a metropolitan landscape, as well as associations among phlebotomines, plants, and local climatic parameters. Three consecutive monthly collections were carried out in an Atlantic Forest fragment, using CDC light traps in peridomestic areas and cashew, coconut, and mango tree. plantations. Eight species of phlebotomine were captured: Evandromyia evandroi, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Psathyromyia shannoni, Sciopemyia sordellii, Evandromyia walkeri, Psychodopygus wellcomei, Nyssomyia whitmani, and Nyssomyia intermedia, primarily from the forest environment. L. longipalpis was confirmed as a species adapted to anthropic environments, while P. wellcomei was shown to be predominately forest-dwelling. Phlebotomines exhibited diversified food consumption patterns in relation to carbohydrate sources. They fed on both native and exotic species of arboreal and shrubby vegetables and gramineous plants. © 2013 The Society for Vector Ecology.

AB  - Objective: Congenital toxoplasmosis is a public health problem in Brazil. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with congenital toxoplasmosis in Minas Gerais which is the second largest Brazilian State based on number of inhabitants, and its territorial extension is larger than that of France. Methods: Population-based case-control study to assess the association between congenital toxoplasmosis and maternal exposure to infection risk factors. The study included mothers/children participating in the Minas Gerais Newborn Screening Program. The cases consisted of 175 mothers of infected children, and the controls consisted of 278 mothers of children without suspected infection. The associations were assessed through binomial logistic regression with p≤0.05. Results: The variables associated with lower probability of toxoplasmosis were: older mother age (OR = 0.89; CI95% = 0.85-0.93), higher level of education (OR = 0.85; CI95% = 0.78-0.92), access to potable water (OR = 0.21; CI95% = 0.08-0.51), and home with flush toilet (OR = 0.18; CI95% = 0.04-078). The variables associated with higher probability of infection were: cats in the neighborhood (OR = 2.27; CI95% = 1.27-4.06), owning or visiting homes with domestic cats (OR = 1.90; CI95% = 1.09-3.31), handling the soil (OR = 2.29; CI95% = 1.32-3.96), and eating fresh meat not previously frozen (OR = 3.97; CI95% = 2.17-7.25). After stratification according region of residence (rural or urban/peri-urban), home with flush toilet and consumption of treated water were protective against the disease only in the rural stratum. Conclusions: In Minas Gerais, congenital toxoplasmosis has been associated with poor socioeconomic conditions. Considering maternal exposure to sources of Toxoplasma gondii, the predominating risk factors were those related to the ingestion of oocysts. It is expected that these results will contribute to development of a program for prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis adapted to the reality of the population of Minas Gerais. The differences between populations living in rural and urban areas regarding the main risk factors for toxoplasmosis point to the need of considering regional specificities in planning strategies to control congenital toxoplasmosis. © 2014 Carellos et al.

AB  - Soil carbon stocks in tropical peatlands have declined recently from water table depth (WTD) drawdown caused by increased frequency and intensity of climate extremes like El Niño and by artificial drainage. Restoration of these carbon stocks under these climatic and anthropogenic disturbances requires improved predictive capacity for hydrological feedbacks to ecological processes. Process-based modeling of tropical peatland ecohydrology could provide us with such capacity, but such modeling has thus far been limited. We aimed at using basic processes for water and O2 transport and their effects on ecosystem water, carbon, and nitrogen cycling to model seasonal and interannual variations of WTD and surface energy exchange. We tested these processes in a process-based model ecosys in a drained tropical Indonesian peatland from an El Niño year 2002 to a wetter year 2005. WTD was modeled from hydraulically driven water transfers controlled vertically by precipitation versus evapotranspiration (ET) and laterally by discharge versus recharge to or from an external reference WTD. These transfers caused WTD drawdown and soil drying to be modeled during dry seasons, which reduced ET and increased Bowen ratio by lowering stomatal conductance. More pronounced dry seasons in drier years 2002-2004 versus wetter year 2005 caused deeper WTD, more intense peat drying, and greater plant water stress. These modeled trends were well corroborated by site measurements as apparent in regression statistics of modeled versus observed WTD (R2 > 0.8), latent heat (R2 > 0.8), and sensible heat (R2 > 0.7) fluxes. Insights gained from this modeling would aid in predicting the fate of tropical peatlands under future drier climates. Key Points Ecosys modeled tropical peatland WTD by a vertical-lateral hydraulic scheme Deeper WTD caused peat drying and reduced stomatal conductance in dry seasons Stomatal limitation to transpiration was stronger in drier dry seasons ©2015.

AB  - Tropical coastal wetlands form complex and dynamic ecosystems based on a mixture of vegetation, soil, and water components. Optical remotely sensed data have often been used to characterize and monitor these ecosystems, which are among the environments most threatened by climate change and anthropogenic activity worldwide. The present study sought to evaluate the spectral response of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images for the interpretation of different wetlands and associated environments at the mouth of the Amazon River, including mangroves, saltmarshes, beaches, and dunes, as well as secondary vegetation, water with different levels of sediment suspension, and human occupation. A Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier was applied to the analysis of Landsat-5 TMsatellite imagery to evaluate the potential for the mapping of these coastal wetland land cover classes. The characterization and comparison of the different spectral classes were obtained through the collection of at least 20 polygonal samples (5 × 5 pixels) for each class, with a total of 4,544 points. Spectral separability indices for each pair of classes were based on an Analysis of Variance, with Tukey post-test. The results indicated that most land cover classes could be separated spectrally with Landsat-5 TM. The overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the results of the classification were 86.1 and 0.84 %, respectively. The results of this spectral analysis demonstrated the potential of the SAM classifier for the classification of the different tropical wetlands in a typical Amazon coastal setting from optical remotely sensed data. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The adoption of no-till in the humid subtropical region of Brazil based on only two precepts of conservation agriculture, soil disturbance restricted to the crop row and crop residue maintained as soil cover, has led to stratification of soil chemical properties in the 0-20 cm soil layer and physical degradation of the subsurface layer (from approximately the 5-20 cm depth), which may make for lower yields during short term droughts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the residual effect of a seed drill/fertilizer applicator equipped with fixed shanks, set at four different depths, for the sowing of maize (Zea mays L.), in mitigation of chemical and physical problems in a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico húmico (Rhodic Hapludox) under no-till for more than ten years. The treatments were: T1 = shank extremity at 5 cm depth; T2 = shank extremity at 10 cm depth; T3 = shank extremity at 15 cm depth; and T4 = shank extremity at 17 cm depth. The crop profile method was used to evaluate soil physical properties (bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and soil resistance to penetration) at eight and ten months after sowing the maize. The chemical properties (pH in water; available P and K; exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Al; potential acidity; and organic matter) were evaluated in layers every 2.5 cm from the 0-22.5 cm depth. The seed drill/fertilizer applicator equipped with fixed shanks for ripping the soil was able to mitigate soil physical and chemical problems, both at eight and 12 months after sowing.

AB  - We quantitatively evaluated mitigation potentials of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use sectors in Indonesia. We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The C cycle in the Brazilian forests is very important, mainly for issues addressed to climate changes and soil management. Assessing and understanding C dynamics in Amazonian soils can help scientists to improve models and anticipate scenarios. New methods that allow soil C measurements in situ are a crucial approach for this kind of region, due to the costs for collecting and sending soil samples from the rainforest to the laboratory. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a multielemental atomic emission spectroscopy technique that employs a highly energetic laser pulse for plasma production and requires neither sample preparation nor the use of reagents. As LIBS takes less than 10 s per sample measurement, it is considered a promising technique for in situ soil analyses. One of the limitations of portable LIBS systems, however, is the common overlap of the emission lines that cannot be spectrally resolved. In this study a method was developed capable of separating the Al interference from the C emission line in LIBS measurements. Two typical forest Brazilian soils rich in Al were investigated: a spodosol (Amazon Forest) and an oxisol (Atlantic Forest). Fifty-three samples were collected and analyzed using a low-resolution LIBS apparatus to measure the intensities of C lines. In particular, two C lines were evaluated, at 193.03 and 247.86 nm. The line at 247.86 nm showed very strong interference with Fe and Si lines, which made quantitative analysis difficult. The line at 193.03 nm showed interference with atomic and ionic Al emission lines, but this problem could be solved by applying a correction method that was proposed and tested in this work. The line at 247.86 was used to assess the proposed model. The strong correlation (Pearson's coefficient R = 0.91) found between the LIBS values and those obtained by a reference technique (dry combustion by an elemental analyzer) supported the validity of the proposed method.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado are among the principal agricultural frontiers of the world, and have attracted global attention because of their potential to be a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. However, accurately quantifying alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to land-use changes remains to be a major challenge. Using a meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate tillage effects on SOC stocks in Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Two approaches: (1) the classical SOC annual change rate which provides only an arithmetic average of SOC changes, and (2) the rate of annual change adjusted from management factors derived according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SOC methodology, which allows a temporal dataset adjustment, were used. Regardless of approach, conservation technologies such as no-tillage (NT) and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems were identified as viable options for SOC sequestration, increasing it between 9 and 16%. One exception was adoption of NT in the Amazon forest, where SOC decreased by 9% over 20 years. Comparing results of the two approaches showed substantial differences between them. For conversions from NT to ICL or from native vegetation to full tillage (FT), the IPCC-based approach produced SOC stock estimates that were 65 and 47% lower, respectively, than with the classical approach. The IPCC approach also identified modeling covariate effects and was influenced less by outliers, thus reducing the risk of under or overestimating soil management effects on SOC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent decades have seen increasing use and importance of translocations and reintroductions as tools for species' conservation and ecological restorations. Most such efforts face substantial logistical complexities and high costs, both biological and financial. These and other challenges have contributed to numerous failures or partial successes of reintroductions, a trend which has improved little over time. Given the negative ramifications of reintroduction failures, practitioners have adopted or developed numerous analytical and procedural methods in efforts to promote successful outcomes. However, many such methods are often ad hoc or taxon-specific, particularly regarding the evaluation and selection of reintroduction areas and sites. Despite the recognized importance of this phase of reintroduction planning, there is to date no comprehensive methodology for selecting suitable reintroduction sites. We describe in detail the application of quantitative SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for objectively evaluating candidate reintroduction areas or sites, and how results of this analysis are used for identifying the most effective and efficient management actions for promoting reintroduction success. We use examples drawn from recent reintroduction plans for three avian species in Puerto Rico (1) and Brazil (2) to illustrate specific methodologies used as well as the results obtained and their application to the reintroduction planning and implementation process. From our findings, quantitative SWOT analysis is a simple, versatile, repeatable and intuitive method for reintroduction area and site selection. The method also provides a valuable mechanism for evaluating and prioritizing management actions relative to their efficiency and effectiveness for achieving reintroduction objectives. © 2015.

AB  - This study had the objectives to estimate equations of biomass and carbon stock of Jatropha (Jatrophacurcas L.). The area of this study is located in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, planting carried out in 3.5x3.0m spacing at 4.64ha. To biomass quantification, we used the direct destructive method, applied to trees, which were selected according to the measurements of height, canopy diameter and number of branches. The tree biomass determination was obtained by the proportionality method. The adapted models were from Spurr and Schumacher & Hall, for biomass and total biomass (aboveground biomass more taproots biomass). The carbon stock was estimated multiplying the biomass by the carbon content of dry matter, which was obtained by calcination in a muffle. The estimate of the equivalent CO2 stored was obtained by multiplying the carbon stock by a factor 44/12. The equation with better model and who was used for carbon stock determination was to Spurr, using total biomass data, B=0.7601*(CD2*H)0.8949, where B = biomass (kg); CD = canopy diameter (m); e H = height (m). The carbon stock of culture, founded to the fourth year, was 6.79MgC ha-1, corresponding to 24.89MgCO2(eq) ha-1. The results shows that Jatropha is environmentally viable for development of CDM afforestation / reforestation projects or carbon projects to voluntary markets, adding income to farmers and improving the financial attractiveness of the crop.

AB  - The major goals of forest governance arrangements are sustainable forest management (SFM), poverty alleviation, and enhancement of forest biodiversity. However, in recent years, climate change mitigation, through reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD. +. 11The "+" signifies that climate change mitigation can also be attained by enhancing forest conservation and restoration.) has emerged as one of the most important aspects of forest governance arrangements. This is due to the fact that REDD. + has the potential to provide a framework for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation while addressing rural poverty and conserving forest biodiversity at the same time. In other words, the REDD. + scheme provides co-benefits beyond its main goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, REDD. + is seen by many forest governance experts as a scheme that has the potential to slow down deforestation in a country like Cameroon, which arguably, has the highest rate of deforestation in the Congo Basin. However, this will depend on the effectiveness of Cameroon's REDD. + policy strategy, its efficiency in meeting its objectives at the lowest cost, and its ability to equitably distribute costs and benefits associated with the scheme. This paper assesses the effectiveness of REDD. + policy design in Cameroon within the context of the climate change regime. The paper employs the policy design approach to analyze four components of Cameroon's REDD. + policy design framework - governance and institutional arrangement; emissions baseline; leakage and scale; and technical issues. An economic-based assessment of the forest transition curve and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) reveals limitations that could render the REDD. + scheme cost ineffective for Cameroon. The paper suggests that Cameroon would have to focus on strengthening its existing governance structures and nurturing its forest related international agreements, if it is to design a REDD. + policy strategy that is consistent with the "nested" climate change regime approach. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The worldwide demand for clean, sustainable energy has increased in recent years. A potential alternative energy source is biomass from nonnative forests, particularly from the genus Eucalyptus spp. in the specific case of Brazil, currently with several selected clonal stands for energy production. Because each stand adapts differently to different environments, specific studies are required in order to evaluate energy production in a given region. The objective of this study is to determine, from among six clonal stands of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake, which have greater potential for production of biomass and energy in the South Central region of Maranhão (Grajaú). Clonal stands planted at a spacing of 4 x 3 m apart were evaluated at age 41 months, distributed in a completely randomized design with five replicates. Each experimental plot consisted of 100 trees. Analysis included determining biomass yield and distribution in each tree portion as well as calorific value of bark and wood components. Out of the six clonal stands, two outdid the others both in biomass yield and in energy generation, surpassing the least yielding stand by up to 27%.

AB  - Brazil is one of the first major developing countries to commit to a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target that requires a reduction of between 36.1% and 38.9% relative to baseline emissions by 2020. The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6Gt CO2e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6Gt CO2e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is a frequent component of agroforestry systems in the Amazon because of its adaptation to nutrient-poor upland soils and multiple uses. We investigated the aboveground biomass production (kg dry weight), nutrient uptake and requirements (N, P, Ca, Mg, K) of Brazil nut trees of different sizes grown under agroforestry conditions and fertilized at different levels. Eight of 70 experimental trees with different size were harvested and stem, branches and leaves were separated. Nutrient contents were determined for three trees of varying size. Average tree growth was fast, but variability was high, suggesting considerable potential for the improvement of this economically important species. The trees responded to increased levels of fertilizer and lime with significantly increased foliar nutrient contents and growth, probably because of the improved availability of Mg and Ca for which the species seems to have a relatively high demand. In contrast to Brazil nut trees grown in forest or dense plantations, the agroforestry trees invested a substantial part of their biomass and nutrients in large branches and developed spreading crowns. To improve stem form, reduce competition with associated crops for light and recycle nutrients, regular pruning of lower branches or planting arrangements that favor self-pruning are recommended. These measures would also increase the recycling of Ca and Mg, large quantities of which are contained in the branches. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami drastically altered the coastal zone of Aceh, Indonesia. Tsunami induced erosion of the coast, including aquaculture farms (tambak) and mangrove forests, destroyed livelihood opportunities and access to coastal resources. The following paper discusses impacts of the tsunami on coastal resources and the associated coastal and disaster management implications. Data is drawn from a time series of digitised mean high water marks (MHWM's) sourced from Google Earth imagery, along with areal measurements of tambak, mangrove and casuarina cover and qualitative interviews with local residents. Two sites, namely, the Banda Aceh west coast and Lhok Nga Bay were studied. The results reveal that within these study sites 68% of mangroves and 92% of tambak ponds have not recovered since the tsunami resulting in the loss of between 241 and 725 tambak livelihoods and mangrove supplied resources including food, wood and shelter. Unique coastal environments respond to, and recover from, tsunami differently depending on factors such as tsunami characteristics, wave climate, sediment supply, vegetation, morphology and level of pre-disturbance human modification. While the study supports recent findings that mangrove and casuarina forests do not substantially mitigate the impact of large tsunamis, it strongly encourages their conservation for the environmental and economic sustainability of coastal communities. The study recommends that better integrated management of coastal resources such as mangroves and tambak, considering disaster management, environmental and economic concerns, will strengthen the resiliency of vulnerable coastal communities such as those in Aceh to future disaster. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasingly, international agreements, treaties, and conventions address tropical deforestation and specific causes of rainforest transformation. Such international regimes may aim to conserve natural forests or to support the exploitation of lands for a particular purpose, e.g. agricultural commodities. This paper's goal is to map the international regime complex for rainforest transformation by identifying those global and regional regimes that are relevant for tropical rainforest transformation systems in Indonesia. The relevance of international regimes for rainforest transformation is assessed based on a novel methodology using two criteria: First, international regimes may be relevant in Indonesia because the core problem they address exists in Indonesia (problem dimension). Second, specific international regimes may be made relevant by the actions of specific actors and their coalitions in pursuit of their interests (actor dimension). To achieve the study's goals we used (1) content analysis of international policy documents and treaty texts, (2) expert interviews with key informants in Indonesia, and (3) own field observations in current Indonesian land use politics. The results indicate that regimes dealing with biological diversity, climate change, trade in endangered species, wetland management, international tropical trade, illegal logging, Southeast Asian (ASEAN) forest and environment, the Asia Pacific free trade, and the southeast Asian rubber trade regime are relevant in both the problem and actor dimensions. The regimes concerned with desertification and international forestry research are relevant only in the actor dimension. In contrast, the following regimes are relevant only in the problem dimension: indigenous rights, forest certification, palm oil certification, agroforestry certification, and international rubber trade. We discuss our results considering global and regional regimes relevant to Indonesian rainforest transformation systems. We conclude that regimes relevant solely due to the engagement of domestic actors and not in respect of the problem dimension are unlikely to maintain their relevance in the long term. In the short term, however, they have the potential for creating substantial political benefits for the actors using them. In contrast, regimes with high problem relevance but low actor backing are unlikely to even enter the political agenda, and therefore will have only limited impact. This suggests that future research should consider that, whilst relevance in the problem dimension is necessary to establish regime influence, it alone does not suffice. We can expect global and regional regimes to have an influence only when powerful actors back them in their agenda setting, domestic policy formulation and actual implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - New management strategies should be identified to increase the potential of bioenergy crops to minimize climate change. This study quantified the impact of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) harvest systems, straw and soil management on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes prior to crop replanting carried out on February 2010 in southern Brazil. The soil studied was classified as Haplustult (USDA Soil Taxonomy). Three sugarcane harvest systems were considered: burned (BH) and green harvest with straw maintained on (GH SM) or removed from (GH SR) the soil surface. Our hypothesis is that intensive tillage and the management of sugarcane crop straw could lead to higher CO2 emissions from soil. We measured CO2 emissions in no-till (NT) conditions and after conventional tillage (CT), and with or without dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications. Soil CO2 emissions were measured with a Li Cor chamber (Model Li-8100). Water content of soil and soil temperature readings were first taken 24 h after tillage, over the next 25 days after tillage with 18 measurement days. The removal of sugarcane straw from the soil surface resulted in the rapid reduction of water content of soil (6% in volume) followed by a 64% increase in soil CO2-C emissions, supporting our hypothesis. Additional soil CO2-C emissions caused by removal of crop straw were 253 kg CO2-C ha-1, which is as high as CO2-C losses induced by tillage. Dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications did not always increase CO2 emissions, especially when applied on soil surface with crop straw and tilled. The conversion from burned to green harvest systems can improve the soil C sequestration rate in sugarcane crops when combined with reduced tillage and straw maintenance on soil surface. The effect of straw removal and related CO2 emission for electricity generation should be considered in further studies from sugarcane areas. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In the end of the 1990s, the Rio Natal community, located in the city of São Bento do Sul, in the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina, started to be part of an Environmental Protection Area. Since then, many cultivation areas have been increasingly having their forest restored. In this scenario, the community proposed to cultivate medicinal plants that were adapted to shaded conditions. To attend this demand, we carried out a participatory research in the community between 2005 and 2008. Fourteen species of medicinal plants having market potential were evaluated, and were cultivated in shaded areas, in three family properties. The survival of the species, the incidence of illnesses and pests, the dry matter value and the height of the plants were evaluated. The species that presented persistence to be cultivated in shaded areas were: Curcuma longa L.; Arctium lappa L.; Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng) Pedersen.; Mikania glomerata Sprengel.; Alternanthera sp.; Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. e Maytenus ilicifolia Mart.

AB  - Airport complexes are great water consumers where the adoption of reuse practices adapted to their particular characteristics may represent significant savings of financial and environmental resources. Greywater reuse is an important alternative for reducing potable water consumption in airports. The objective of this study was to assess the quality of greywater produced in airport environments and the reuse potential of such effluent. This study was developed in a mid-size airport in Brazil, where a qualitative assessment of greywater produced by different activities was performed. The results were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate statistics. Greywater production in the administrative buildings was estimated by the application of questionnaires and interviewing employees, and compared to the non-potable demand in these buildings. The results showed that the quality of the greywater produced in the airport is similar to that produced in residences and can be easily treated for reuse purposes. In quantitative terms, greywater reuse can meet the non-potable demand and provide great savings of water and financial resources, in addition to priceless environmental benefits. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo / Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and processes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are losses in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocessing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested.

AB  - This study determined the mobility of sulfentrazone in soils used for reforestation (Haplic Planosol, Ultisol, Humic Cambisol, and Regolithic Neosol) in the south of Brazil. To form the soil columns, previously prepared PVC tubes (10-cm diameter and 50-cm long) were filled with soil samples. Sulfentrazone was applied on top of the columns, which contained soil with moisture close to the field capacity. Subsequently, simulated 60-mm rainfall was applied to the columns. After draining the water, the columns were opened, and soil samples of each segment of 5.0 cm of the columns were taken for analysis of sulfentrazone by high-performance liquid chromatography. The herbicide was extracted from the soils by the solid–liquid extraction method with low temperature partition (SLE-LTP), which was adapted and validated. Sulfentrazone showed high mobility in the four soils analyzed, but presented lower mobility in the Humic Cambisol due to its lower rate of desorption. In this soil, the herbicide remained in the upper layers of the column, while in the other soils the herbicide was distributed throughout the columns. The soil that held the highest concentration of the compound in the first two segments of the column (0–5 and 5–10 cm) was the one with the highest clay content. Thus, it was concluded that the sulfentrazone leaching process in the soils analyzed is dependent on the chemical and physical characteristics of the soils, particularly, the contents of clay, sand, and organic matter. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30 cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Questions: (1) Do species richness, flower functional diversity and redundancy of tree and non-tree species increase with restoration age; (2) are the flower traits of the reference forest similar to those found in restored sites; and (3) does species originality, in terms of unique combinations of different set of flower traits, differ among sites? Location: Forests restored by planting a high diversity assemblage of tree species, within the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil. Methods: We sampled all reproductive individuals (353 species) and classified them in terms of floral type, colour, size, generalization level and openness. As most trees were planted and non-tree species (sub-shrub, shrub, herbs, epiphytes, climbers and hemi-parasitic plants) were mostly naturally established, we analysed them in separate analyses. We compared species richness, functional diversity, redundancy and originality among sites. Moreover, we identified optimal subsets of flower traits to describe vegetation succession trends. Results: (1) Flower functional diversity of tree species could be achieved after two decades of restoration, but remained far from reference values for non-tree species. The same gap regarding reference values occurred with species richness, which increased over restoration periods, although were far from the reference values. Redundancy and functional diversity are not related to restoration age. (2) Red/burgundy colour, gullet and bell-funnel shape and large size were identified as indicators of the reference forest flowers. Different indicator traits were found for each restoration sites. (3) Sites were similar regarding originality for tree and for non-tree species. Conclusion: A highly diverse species pool seems to promise to increase richness and functional diversity of tree species, but not of non-tree species. Trait analyses have important implications for restoration projects and can be used instead of species taxonomic identity, especially for highly diverse tropical forests. Such functional diversity may be advanced through a priori definition of which species from the regional pool can be used in plantings for forest restoration, with special attention to functional traits of non-tree species. Otherwise, restoration sites in highly fragmented landscapes will not reach functional diversity of reference sites, even after a five-decade period. A highly diverse species pool seems to promise to increase richness and functional diversity of tree species. Flower functional diversity of trees could be achieved after two decades of restoration, but non-trees remained far from reference values, even after a five-decade period in highly-fragmented landscapes. Our adaptation of indicator value method may be used for other ecosystem types. © 2015 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aquatic systems responsible for water supply in the Brazilian Federal District (FD) have been threatened by anthropogenic pressures, especially considering the expressive demographic increase in the region during the last decades. The purposes of this research were: (a) to assess the water quality in streams located in the FD by monitoring physical-chemical variables; (b) to define baselines for these variables among different ecological status categories. The 14 investigated streams were sampled between 2006 and 2009, in the dry (August-September, 2006, 2008, 2009) and rainy (March-April, 2008, 2009) seasons. All sampling sites were classified in four categories ("very impacted", "impacted", "in transition" and "natural") using an adaptation of a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Differences in water quality among sites were generally well predicted in the four ecological status categories defined by the protocol, which showed a gradient in nutrient concentrations from reference sites classified as "natural" (medians: electrical conductivity = 7.3 μS cm -1; nitrate = 0.040 mg L-1; ammonium = 0.039 mg L -1; soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) = <0.001 mg L-1; total phosphorus (TP) = 0.006 mg L-1;) to those classified as "very impacted" (medians: electrical conductivity = 87.7 μS cm -1; nitrate = 0.247 mg L-1; ammonium = 0.219 mg L -1; SRP = 0.010 mg L-1; TP = 0.035 mg L-1). Point sources inputs were the main factor for water quality deterioration. The nutrient baselines reported were relatively low when compared to data collected from reference areas in Brazil (e.g., São Paulo State) or temperate regions, especially for TP. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - REDD+ social safeguards have gained increasing attention in numerous forums. This paper reviews the evolution of multi-level policy dialogues, processes, and actions related to REDD+ social safeguards (e.g., Cancun Safeguards 1-5) among policy makers, civil society organizations, and within the media in Brazil, Indonesia and Tanzania, three countries with well advanced REDD+ programs. We find that progress on core aspects of social safeguards is uneven across the three countries. Brazil is by far the most advanced having drafted a REDD+ social safeguards policy. Both Brazil and Indonesia have benefited from progress made by strong sub-national entities in the operationalization of REDD+ safeguards including free prior and informed consent (FPIC), participation, and benefit sharing. Tanzania has weakly articulated how social safeguards will be operationalized and has a more top-down approach. We conclude that in all three countries, measuring, reporting and verifying progress on social safeguards is likely to be a complex issue. Stakeholders with vested interests in REDD+ social safeguards operate in polycentric rather than nested systems, suggesting that aggregation of information from local to national-scale will be a challenge. However, polycentric systems are also likely to support more transparent and comprehensive safeguards systems. Clear direction from the international community and financing for REDD+ safeguard MRV is essential if REDD+ social safeguards are to be meaningfully integrated into forest-based climate mitigation strategies. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Afforestation of temperate grasslands with fast-growing trees for industrial pulpwood production is spreading in South America. Despite high afforestation rates resulting from governmental policies that stimulate pulpwood production in grasslands of southern Brazil and Uruguay, the impact of this activity on biodiversity remains to be properly assessed. We used an Impact-Reference study design to evaluate how grassland afforestation affects the composition of grassland bird assemblages. We sampled eucalyptus plantations and neighboring natural grasslands in southern Brazil from 2006-2009, and relied on nested sampling and analysis to separate the effects of afforestation from the natural variability of grasslands. We recorded a significant difference in composition between assemblages from grasslands and tree plantations. Species adapted to open, treeless areas tended to be negatively affected in relation to edge or forest birds in eucalyptus plantations. Afforestation is systematically replacing the bird assemblage of hilltop grasslands by a collection of common edge and forest species that occur in nearby riverine and hillside forests. Although most grassland birds negatively affected by tree plantations are common and widespread, observed and predicted afforestation rates in southeastern South America may result in regional population reductions in the near future.

AB  - Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (≥110 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon- conservation activities, sampling of stems ≥20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor - an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems ≥10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made. © 2015 Berenguer et al.

AB  - In Indonesia, most of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) cultivars with orange-colour rind are grown on the high land areas of 700-1200 m above sea level. Growing trees under this altitude induces the fruit rind color to change to greenish yellow with more pale flesh. Evaluation of five selected trees had been conducted in order to choose the best one based on the horticultural performance. The selected mother tree were free from the Huang Long Bin pathogen, Citrus tristeza virus, and other viruses by shoot tip grafting, followed by indexing. Now, three years after the viruses, tree planting materials were produced. More than 200,000 trees or 400 ha have been planted by citrus growers in the regency of Nunukan, Berau and Kutai Timur in East Kalimantan, Borneo where this mandarin cultivar was found. 'Borneo Prima', the promising mandarin cultivar will become a mascot of East Kalimantan. It has round-shaped fruit, yellow to orange colour rind, easy peeling and good balance between sweet and sour taste. It is well adapted to low and wet areas. The crop re×uirement, agro-ecological zones and its relation with other cultivars of mandarin by DNA-test, are discussed in more detail in this paper.

AB  - This paper draws on a case study of the Brazilian Amazon to assess how two widely promoted strategies to govern tropical forests - non-state certification and state-based legality initiatives - interact with tropical wood production systems and the implications this holds for reducing deforestation and degradation and for local benefit-sharing. The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance. We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatland has been subjected to rapid economic development which causing harms to its ecosystem and altering its function from carbon storage to carbon emitter. Therefore, sustainable management of tropical peatland is necessary to control global carbon balance. As an initial step to actualize the sustainable management of tropical peatland, reliable monitoring technique is needed. Remote sensing is suitable to be used in tropical peatland monitoring activities whereas the direct measurements are generally labor intensive and limited to accessibility. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers cloud-free observation for tropical peatland monitoring in humid tropic areas. However, there are few studies on developing tropical peatland identification methodology by using L-Band full polarimetric SAR data. In this study, a methodology to identify tropical peatland has been developed by taking advantage of L-Band full polarimetric ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) data on two study areas in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Thus, three Polarimetric Decomposition (PD) theorems and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) were evaluated to examine the characteristic of tropical peatland in the view point of L-Band full polarimetric SAR. The result showed that shrub class derived from unsupervised classification of polarimetric parameters of Freeman-Durden decomposition integrated with a certain interval of RVI were successfully identified tropical peatland. In addition, overall accuracy of 73.6% and 75.2% were obtained for study area 1 and 2 respectively. These results indicate that L-Band full polarimetric SAR is useful for tropical peatland monitoring activity in response to the global climate change mitigation scheme.

AB  - In order to evaluate the effectiveness of demand-side and supply-side water conservation measures and identify viable solutions to reduce domestic water consumption, it is crucial to quantify how much water is consumed by each major domestic water fixtures and appliances and understand how water is being used by residents in a household. Having these issues in mind, the overall aim of this investigation was to provide specific information regarding domestic water end-use consumption and assess the feasibility for an array of water conservation equipments and systems in terms of their applicability, water savings and financial benefits for residential multi-storey buildings in the Federal District, Brazil. Findings suggest that low budget water efficient equipments are of simple installation and are capable of promoting water savings and financial benefits. Although water reuse systems were capable of promoting significant reductions on water consumption, overall, they proved to be economically unviable options due to their high costs, suggesting that governmental policies and subsidies over taxes and interest rates could be used as means of promoting incentives for the general public to invest in water reuse systems.

AB  - Fire emissions associated with land cover change and land management contribute to the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, which can affect regional air quality and climate. Mitigating these impacts requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between fires and different land cover change trajectories and land management strategies. We develop future fire emissions inventories from 2010-2030 for Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) to assess the impact of varying levels of forest and peatland conservation on air quality in Equatorial Asia. To compile these inventories, we combine detailed land cover information from published maps of forest extent, satellite fire radiative power observations, fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database, and spatially explicit future land cover projections using a land cover change model. We apply the sensitivities of mean smoke concentrations to Indonesian fire emissions, calculated by the GEOS-Chem adjoint model, to our scenario-based future fire emissions inventories to quantify the different impacts of fires on surface air quality across Equatorial Asia. We find that public health impacts are highly sensitive to the location of fires, with emissions from Sumatra contributing more to smoke concentrations at population centers across the region than Kalimantan, which had higher emissions by more than a factor of two. Compared to business-as-usual projections, protecting peatlands from fires reduces smoke concentrations in the cities of Singapore and Palembang by 70% and 40%, and by 60% for the Equatorial Asian region, weighted by the population in each grid cell. Our results indicate the importance of focusing conservation priorities on protecting both forested (intact or logged) peatlands and non-forested peatlands from fire, even after considering potential leakage of deforestation pressure to other areas, in order to limit the impact of fire emissions on atmospheric smoke concentrations and subsequent health effects. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Over 70% of threatened birds in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, inhabit forest environments. The creation and maintenance of protected areas is one of the most important measures aiming to mitigate these problems. However, the knowledge of the local biodiversity is essential so that these areas can effectively preserve the natural resources. Between 2004 and 2009 we sampled the avifauna in two conservation units in Rio Grande do Sul: Floresta Nacional de Canela (FNC) and Parque Natural Municipal da Ronda (PMR), both representative of the Mixed Humid Forest (Araucaria Forest). A total of 224 species was recorded, 116 at FNC and 201 at PMR, ten of which threatened regionally: Pseudastur polionotus, Odontophorus capueira, Patagioenas cayennensis, Amazona pretrei, A. vi-nacea, Triclaria malachitacea, Campephilus robustus, Grallaria varia, Procnias nudicollis and Sporophila melanogaster. Richness and species composition seem to be related to different stages of forest conservation, to size and connectivity, as well as to the diversity of environments. The better conservation of PMR compared to FNC, allied to its geographic position, results in a richer avifauna, with a larger amount of rare and endangered species, as well as species sensitive to disturbance and endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest. We suggest management actions aiming the conservation and the long-term recovery of natural environments at these sites.

AB  - Restoration of Atlantic Forests is receiving increasing attention because of its role in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration for global climate change mitigation. This study was carried out in an Atlantic Forest restoration project in the south-central region of São Paulo State - Brazil to develop allometric equations to estimate tree biomass of indigenous tree species in mixed plantations. Above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively), stem diameter (DBH: diameter at 1.3 m height), tree height (H: total height) and specific wood density (WD) were measured for 60 trees of 19 species. Different biomass equations (linear and nonlinear-transformed) were adjusted to estimate AGB and BGB as a function of DBH, H and WD. For estimating AGB and BGB, the linear biomass equation models were the least accurate. The transformed nonlinear biomass equation that used log DBH2, log H and log WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for AGB and the transformed nonlinear biomass equations that used log DBH2*WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for BGB. It is concluded that these adjusted equations can be used to estimate the AGB and BGB in areas of the studied project. The adjusted equations can be recommended for use elsewhere in the region for forest stands of similar age, tree size ranges, species composition and site characteristics.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo/Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and processes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are losses in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocessing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested.

AB  - The forest species cultivation with rapid growth in Brazil has increased, mainly due to the diverse use of its wood and climate adaptation. The cultivation with minimum tillage in the forest sector stands out a way to increase productivity, combined with the maintenance of biodiversity and soil conservation. This study was conducted at the experimental area of State Foundation for Agricultural Research - Research Center for Forestry in Santa Maria - RS, with aimed to evaluate the effect of the soil tillage methods on soil physical properties and on initial development of Eucalyptus grandis, in a sandy loam Typic Hapludalf. Four soil management practices were compared: no-tillage; chisel tillage; chisel tillage plus harrowing and; rotary tillage (rotary tiller), installed in a randomized block design with three replications. The soil under no-tillage conditioned lower initial growth of eucalyptus due higher soil penetration resistance and bulk density, when compared with treatments with mobilization. The root distribution analysis in soil, despite being a qualitative method, was effective in demonstrating the effect of soil tillage for the Eucalyptus grandis plantation. The soil tillage with mobilization resulted in a higher initial growth of Eucalyptus grandis. The chisel tillage effects in the soil physical properties persisted after one year of soil tillage.

AB  - Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00±0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703±38 Mg C ha-1) is roughly a 2.6±0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272±49 Mg C ha-1). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5±0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The identification of the main sources of anthropic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the mitigation and removal of these emissions has become an important instrument in the attenuation of the climatic changes predicted by the IPCC. The largest emission source in Brazil is forest conversion. This land use change has always had a strong relationship with the expansion of agriculture, an activity of great importance in the country, which has the largest commercial cattle herd in the planet. Following the considerable reduction in emissions from deforestation, agriculture has been since 2010 the most important source (MCTI (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação), 2013. Brasília: Ministério daCiência, Tecnologia e Inovação, Brasil). Seeking to discover the possibilities of altering the emissions profile in the agricultural sector, four scenarios were developed related to how this is dealt with in the beef cattle sector, calculating the potential removal of carbon from the atmosphere through natural regeneration of biomes. The results suggest that picketing and rotation scenario has the greatest potential, with a carbon reduction of 17.7GtCO2eq, while the shared raising with grain legumes scenario has the lowest calculated reduction potential of 7.1GtCO2eq was calculated. The animal confinement scenario had an intermediary reduction potential of 8.3GtCO2eq. The mosaic of methods scenario, in which it is attempted to simulate the parallel adoption of the measures proposed in all other scenarios, had a reduction potential of 13.1GtCO2eq. In the scenarios where animal confinement occurs, the treatment of waste with biodigestion allows the generation of biogas and biofertilizers, contributing to an increase in the potential carbon reduction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Pará State, Brazil. All trees >25cm were monitored in 25.4ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25ha for trees >10cmdbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4m3ha-1 in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m3 ha-1, respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8Mgha-1 year-1 in the RIL plot but only 0.5Mgha-1year-1 in the CL plot. By 16years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Tropical forest change is driven by demand in distant markets. Equally, investments in tropical forest landscapes by capital originating from distant emerging economies are on the rise. Understanding how forest outcomes vary by investment source is therefore becoming increasingly important. We empirically evaluate the relationship between investment source and deforestation from 2000 to 2010 in the Republic of Congo. A Congolese forestry code was implemented in 2000 to mitigate degradation of production forests by standardizing all logging in the country according to sustainable forest management(SFM) guidelines. Following the implementation of this law, the majority(73%) of Congo's production forests were managed by European(40%) and Asian(33%) companies. European concessions had the highest rates of total and core deforestation, followed by Asian concessions, indicating that the fragmentation of intact forests in Congo is strongly associated with industrial logging fueled by foreign capital. European concession holders were also far more likely to comply with SFM policies, followed by Asian concessions, suggesting that compliance with Sustainable Forest Management policies may not mitigate degradation in tropical production forests. Further evaluation of the relationship between investment source, regulatory compliance, and outcomes in tropical countries is essential for effective conservation of tropical forest ecosystems. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The soil remediation field is still in development in Brazil. Currently, it is not known how many contaminated sites exist across the country; however, due to the country's large size and its extensive urbanization and industrialization, it can be postulated that the number of contaminated sites must be very high. To remediate these sites, new sustainable technologies should be identified and evaluated. A technology that was born in the 1990s in the USA, and has been fairly investigated, is the use of nanoparticles (NPs) to degrade contaminants in soils and groundwater. This study aims to present a bibliographic review of nanotechnology application to remediation of soils and groundwater, as well as assess the potential of conducting research in this field in Brazil. This paper first presents an overview of the number of contaminated areas identified in the USA and Europe. The basic concepts of nanomaterials followed by classification, synthesis, and characterization of nanomaterials are explained. The main types of contaminants for which the technique was already applied as well as the chemical reactions between them and NPs are presented. The issues related to delivery and migration of NPs in the porous media is discussed. Concerns regarding the toxicity of nanomaterials are discussed. The in situ applications of nanomaterials for contaminated site remediation are presented. It is concluded that the issues involving remediation of soils and groundwater are site specific and it is not possible to directly transfer knowledge gained from sedimentary soils of temperate climates for residual soils found in tropical and subtropical climate regions. The research on nanotechnology for site remediation in Brazil has just begun, and more efforts are required from the technical and academic professionals to develop nanotechnology as practical technology for the remediation of contaminated sites. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper examines the cost structure of certified emission reductions (CERs) through various types of projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. Using the CDM project data, the costs of CERs and their variation across technology and over time and space are estimated by applying alternative functional forms and specifications. Results show that the average cost of CERs decreases with the project scale and duration, scale and duration effects significantly vary across project types, and there is an upward trend in costs. The results also show that the distribution of the projects in the CDM portfolio or a given location does not strictly follow the relative cost structure, nor does the distribution of the CDM projects in different host countries follow the principle of comparative advantage. More than 84% of the CDM portfolio consists of various energy projects with substantially higher costs of CERs than afforestation and reforestation, industrial and landfill gas reduction, and methane avoidance projects, which are only 12% of all projects. While per unit cost of abatement plays an important role in the bottom-up and top-down models to evaluate emission reduction potential and analyze policy alternatives, the findings contradict the presumption of such models that project investors seek out low-cost opportunities. At the aggregate level, the cost of CER by the projects in Asia and Europe is similar but higher than those hosted in Africa, Americas, and Oceania. Yet more than 83% of the projects in the CDM portfolio are located in Asia; more than 69% of the projects are in China and India alone. China appears to have a comparative advantage (i.e., lowest opportunity cost) in energy efficiency projects, while India has a comparative advantage in hydro power projects and Brazil has a comparative advantage in wind power projects. In contrast, energy efficiency category accounts for only 8% of the CDM projects in China, hydro power accounts for 12% of the projects in India, and wind power accounts for 18% of the projects in Brazil. The results provide a basis for evaluating the incentives that the mechanism offers as a cost effective policy instrument that balances greenhouse gas mitigation across sectors and regions, while fulfilling the objective of the convention. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits. In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation systems (modified “taungya” agroforestry system; and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species) established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in São Paulo state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height ≥0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M. caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area. Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The properties and components of the peat allow peatlands to function as water reservoirs which participate in the hydrological cycle by modulating water discharge. In particular, mountain peatlands from Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) provide water of good quality for the nearby cities and also serve as habitats for wildlife and flora, with unique endemic species. In this paper, we present the characterization of four mountain mires (Pau de Fruta, São João da Chapada, Pinheiros and Sempre Viva) based on morphological, physical, chemical, and elemental properties analyzed in five selected peat cores (PdF-I, PdF-II, SJC, PI and SV). Radiocarbon dating indicates that they started to form during the late Pleistocene. Principal components analysis was applied to synthesize their main peat properties and underlying processes. The first principal component, PC1, is related to the relative content in inorganic versus organic matter of the peat, most probably related to the evolution of the soils of the mires' catchments (i.e. soil erosion); PC2 seems to be related to the incorporation of inorganic material by deposition of dust from regional sources; PC3 reflects the content and preservation of plant remains; and PC4 indicates the degree of peat decomposition. Our results suggest that mountain tropical mires from Serra do Espinhaço Meridional are complex peatland ecosytems, with a large potential for the reconstruction of environmental changes (i.e. climate change) occurred since the late Pleistocene, and that they should be fully protected. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The evidences that the chemical industry is not ready to deal with interruption of operations resulting from climate change and the complexity of decisions is increasingly apparent. In the state of São Paulo / Brazil, petrochemical industries are using served water from sewage treatment plants to supply the cooling tower makeup water. However, industries are not striving to analyze the availability of water and energy to suit the demand to supply. The setting of premises to build scenarios of water availability, energy and skills is required. This will allow to make strategic plans, control programs, techniques and methods of investigation that aspects of products and processes are considered as well as the characteristics of the culture and behavior of managers and employees. The water supply scenario and its use in the agriculture, livestock and cities indicate that there will be reduced availability of water for industry. As these consumer sectors are disorganized and there are losses in the distribution of water in the order of 30%, it is up to industry to worry about meeting their demand while reducing your water consumption. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis model of availability of water and energy in the chemical industry, along with a behavioral adjustment model to enhance a large reduction in water consumption and energy supply to meet the expectations of these. The reduction in water consumption and energy depends on: management actions; switching procedures; behavior changes in the short term; application reuse techniques and reprocessing wastewater and energy in the medium term; and development and installation of technologies to increase the supply of water and energy and to reduce demand for water and energy in the long run. Initially normal trend of events without intervention in the provision of management or demand management is considered. If occur climate change altering the supply of water and energy, on the other is the population and industrial growth by increasing demand for water and energy. In this case the industry will become hostage to a situation of lack of water and energy when looking at demand in relation to supply. In our case this will occur in 2022. The analysis of availability compensates for the reduced supply with even greater reduction in demand. The analysis method of availability is divided into the following steps considering the comparison between the supply of water and energy with climate change with the demand for water and energy with preventive actions. Should perform prediction of what should happen in the future to adjust the present with the routine programs. This methodology is divided into the following steps: (1) Definition of current and future supply scenarios based on IPCC; (2) Identification of current demand scenario and future to compare Offer; (3) Analysis of the availability of water, energy and competence; (4) Culture Analysis and People for behavioral change; (5) Analysis of Routine and Integrated Management; and (6) Compliance Analysis of consumption of water and energy. A case of the chemical fertilizer industry are tested. Copyright © 2016 Retained by Authors, April, UNPUBLISHED.

AB  - Commercial reforestation of Brazilian native species to produce hardwood for sawmills has been recently intensified in the country. Among the potential species planted by the logging industry is guanandi (Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess) because it is widely distributed in the country, highly adapted to different soil and climate conditions, good bole form and high quality timber. The development of genetic improvement programs should prioritize gains in productivity and yields in the medium and long term. For such programs to be successful, the study of vegetative propagation techniques to abbreviate steps in forest improvement and allow its mass production is fundamental. To assess the viability of vegetative propagation of the species, two successive experiments were carried out during two years testing the best type of cutting, hormone concentration and management. Different cuttings types submitted to increasing doses of indole-butyric acid (IBA) were tested to evaluate survival, sprouting, rooting and callus formation. Results indicate that the species is viable for vegetative propagation with 85 to 90% rooting of cuttings from seedlings in the IBA concentrations of 3000 to 7000 mg.L-1. For the cuttings, sprouting from the base of adult trees 3000 mg.L-1 was the best concentration of IBA. © 2015, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.

AB  - TRANSPETRO is responsible, among other activities, by operation and maintenance of pipelines throughout Brazil. Particularly in the Midwest region the company operates the OSBRA pipeline, which moves about 8.7 Mm3/years of fuel and covers approximately 1,000 km long, predominantly in tropical soils. Erosive processes are significant and constitute the main geotechnical occurrence in OSBRA pipelines rightsof- way. In order to identify the susceptibility to erosion of the area close to the pipelines were developed basic thematic maps, that overlaid will help in identifying homogeneous zones in terms of existing material susceptibility. The mapping is being accompanied by an extensive endeavor of field inspections along the pipeline rights-of-way, that comprised geotechnical investigations, verifying the conditions of use and soil management, the conservation status of existing drainage works and geotechnical characterization of soil samples of major geological formations, including erodibility tests. The methodology is being developed in ArcGIS frame, starting from the morphometric analysis and the use of Digital Elevation Models (DEM), aiming to understanding superficial flow conditions (acceleration and concentration) and consequent soil loss. The modeling results will be compared with historical occurrences erosive 15 (fifteen) years of pipeline operation, seeking for an adherence on various geological, topographical and meteorological tested. The methodology will improve further procedures for identifying potential erosions in tropical soils and will allow to anticipating preventive maintenance in the most susceptible locals the pipeline rights-of-way, suggesting mitigation measures best suited for each type of potential erosive mechanism. © 2013 by ASME.

AB  - The main assumptions and findings are presented on a comparative analysis of three GHG long-term emissions scenarios for Brazil. Since 1990, land-use change has been the most important source of GHG emissions in the country. The voluntary goals to limit Brazilian GHG emissions pledged a reduction in between 36.1% and 38.9% of GHG emissions projected to 2020, to be 6-10% lower than in 2005. Brazil is in a good position to meet the voluntary mitigation goals pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) up to 2020: recent efforts to reduce deforestation have been successful and avoided deforestation will form the bulk of the emissions reduction commitment. In 2020, if governmental mitigation goals are met, then GHG emissions from the energy system would become the largest in the country. After 2020, if no additional mitigation actions are implemented, GHG emissions will increase again in the period 2020-2030, due to population and economic growth driving energy demand, supply and GHG emissions. However, Brazil is in a strong position to take a lead in low-carbon economic and social development due to its huge endowment of renewable energy resources allowing for additional mitigation actions to be adopted after 2020. Policy relevance The period beyond 2020 is now relevant in climate policy due to the Durban Platform agreeing a 'protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force' that will have effect from 2020. After 2020, Brazil will be in a situation more similar to other industrialized countries, faced with a new challenge of economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions, requiring the adoption of mitigation policies and measures targeted at the energy system. Unlike the mitigation actions in the land-use change sector, where most of the funding will come from the national budgets due to sovereignty concerns, the huge financial resources needed to develop low-carbon transport and energy infrastructure could benefit from soft loans channelled to the country through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Prevention is the most effective way of mitigating the negative impacts of exotic species invasions on biodiversity. Preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species. We expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance. If ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically, such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity, supporting the coexistence of closely related species. Here, we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures. We sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the Araponga municipality, Brazil, and measured understory light availability. Phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems. Of the 48 species found, 25 occurred in agroforestry systems, three of which were exotics. Forty-two species were found in monoculture stands (including 13 exotics). As expected, NRI and NTI indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands. Agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species, filtering them from the understory. The mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown; however, shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix. Therefore, agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a potentially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54% in 1995, 18% in 2009) while oil palm increased 4-39%. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha-1 in 1990 to 61 Mg ha-1 in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO2e ha-1 year-1. While 41% of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO2e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - There is increasing demand for agricultural commodities that are produced in a climate-friendly manner. At the same time, in many or most tropical countries there is need for intensification of agricultural production to increase yields and incomes, and this usually requires higher external inputs that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions. Here we investigate if production methods that have a beneficial effect on the climate (are climate-friendly) are compatible with increased inputs and yields for traditional, shaded cocoa (Theobroma cacao) production systems (locally known as cabrucas) in southern Bahia, Brazil. We use two easily measurable and manageable dimensions of climate friendliness, namely the carbon (C) stocks in the large trees and the C footprint as related to on-farm agrochemical and fuel use. Through interviews and field inventories in 26 cabruca farms representing a range of production practices and intensities, we identify the combinations of management practices, yields, C stocks and C footprints typically found in the region. We find that yield levels up to the highest encountered yield of 585 kg ha−1, or twice the current regional average of 285 kg ha−1, are compatible with an aboveground C stock in the large shade trees (>30 cm diameter at breast height) of up to 65 Mg ha−1 and up to 55 % shade. Higher C stocks and shade levels are generally associated with yields below the regional average. Input-related C emissions increased non-linearly with increasing yield, but even the highest encountered yields were compatible with low (<0.25 kg CO2e kg−1 of cocoa) to medium (<0.5 kg CO2e kg−1 of cocoa) input-related emission levels. Cocoa yields responded positively to increased fertilizer applications, provided that other factors, including shade levels, were not limiting. Consequently, the highest input-related emissions (>1 kg CO2e kg−1 of cocoa) were related to large fertilizer applications that did not proportionately increase yields. We conclude that doubling the cocoa output from southern Bahia, where cabrucas are the predominant form of growing cocoa, is compatible with climate-friendly production practices, measured by local standards. We suggest that the presented methodology can be used to identify opportunities for climate-friendly intensification of tree crops more generally, thereby increasing the contribution of commodity production to global climate change mitigation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The steel industry is under pressure to reduce its CO2 emissions, which arise from the use of fossil coal. In the long-term, the injection of pulverized particles of charcoal from biomass (biochar) through the BF tuyerees, here called Bio-PCI (Bio-Pulverized Carbon Injection), offers attractive features from the environmental and metallurgical viewpoints. Biochar presents advantages based on its carbon-neutrally and on its imparting fewer impurities to the iron than coke. The potential of Bio-PCI, has been assessed from its CO2 abatement potential and economic point of view. A cost objective function has been used to measure the impact on iron production of biochar substitution in highly fuel efficient BF among the top 9 hot metal producers; estimations are based on cost determinants in ironmaking. This contribution aims to shed light on two strategic questions: under which conditions can be economically attractive to implement Bio-PCI? And where is such a techno-economic innovation likely to be taken up earliest? Results indicate a potential CO2 mitigation of 18% - 40% with respect current emission rates; on the economic assessment findings show that biochar cannot solely on price compete with fossil coal, thus lower biochar cost or the introduction of carbon taxes are necessary to increment the competitiveness of Bio-PCI. Based on actual prices of raw materials, electricity and carbon taxes, biochar should be between 130.1-236.4 USD/t and carbon taxes 47.1-198.7 USD/t CO2 to facilitate Bio-PCI substitution in examined countries. With respect to the implementation, Brazil, followed by India, China and USA appeared to be in better position to deploy Bio-PCI.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, with environmental stressors increasingly affecting the ability of reef-building corals to sustain growth from calcification (G), photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R). These processes support the foundation of coral reefs by directly influencing biogeochemical nutrient cycles and complex ecological interactions and therefore represent key knowledge required for effective reef management. However, metabolic rates are not trivial to quantify and typically rely on the use of cumbersome in situ respirometry chambers and/or the need to remove material and examine ex situ, thereby fundamentally limiting the scale, resolution and possibly the accuracy of the rate data. Here we describe a novel low-cost in situ respirometry bag that mitigates many constraints of traditional glass and plexi-glass incubation chambers. We subsequently demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel "Flexi-Chamber" approach via two case studies: 1) the Flexi-Chamber provides values of P, R and G for the reef-building coral Siderastrea cf. stellata collected from reefs close to Salvador, Brazil, which were statistically similar to values collected from a traditional glass respirometry vessel; and 2) wide-scale application of obtaining P, R and G rates for different species across different habitats to obtain inter- and intra-species differences. Our novel cost-effective design allows us to increase sampling scale of metabolic rate measurements in situ without the need for destructive sampling and thus significantly expands on existing research potential, not only for corals as we have demonstrated here, but also other important benthic groups. © 2015 Camp et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - Water availability for a range of human uses will increasingly be affected by climate change, especially in the arid and semiarid tropics. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the infrastructure sufficiency in meeting water demand under climate-induced socio-hydrological transition in the Capibaribe River basin (CRB). The basin has experienced spatial and sectoral (agriculture-to-urban) reconfiguration of water demands. Human settlements that were once dispersed, relying on intermittent sources of surface water, are now larger and more spatially concentrated, which increases water-scarcity effects. Based on the application of linked hydrologic and water-resources models using precipitation and temperature projections of the IPCC SRES (Special Report: Emissions Scenarios) A1B scenario, a reduction in rainfall of 26.0% translated to streamflow reduction of 60.0%. We used simulations from four members of the HadCM3 (UK Met Office Hadley Centre) perturbed physics ensemble, in which a single model structure is used and perturbations are introduced to the physical parameterization schemes in the model (Chou et al., 2012). We considered that the change of the water availability in the basin in the future scenarios must drive the water management and the development of adaptation strategies that will manage the water demand. Several adaptive responses are considered, including water-loss reductions, wastewater collection and reuse, and rainwater collection cisterns, which together have potential to reduce future water demand by 23.0%. This study demonstrates the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure system during socio-hydrological transition in response to hydroclimatic and demand variabilities in the CRB and also indicates the differential spatial impacts and vulnerability of multiple uses of water to changes over time. The simulations showed that the measures proposed and the water from interbasin transfer project of the São Francisco River had a positive impact over the water supply in the basin, mainly for human use. Industry and irrigation will suffer impact unless other measures are implemented for demand control.

AB  - The rail transportation, either of passengers or cargo, is essential to the country's economic growth. Due to a number of factors, in particular, severe mobility problems experienced by large cities and a demand for urban transport systems and suburban high capacity transport on rails going through a period of recovery with new investments being announced both for the construction of new railway sections, as for reclamation and re-adaptation of existing railway networks. In this context, the liability of decades without investment, necessitates a rational use of available resources and agile enabling to country develop projects for the sector rapidly and consistently. This paper presents a proposal that aims to make it easier to review and registration of a railroad. The proposal is obtain a film at 360° with a spherical vision camera Lady Bug (6 cameras) from Point Grey Research, a Sony Full HD Camcorder and a Sony High Resolution camera with integrated GPS system. The images collected will be stored in a georeferenced database in a computer system developed for this purpose which will be able to contain the record of all events by the slice, generating reports with data, pictures and location map. Applied to the specific case of metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte/Brazil. The data obtained in the study of railway network BHMR and surroundings, were used to subsidize the State Government, through the Agency for Development of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, in assessing the feasibility of implementing transport passenger rail in this network.

AB  - The Congo Basin forests are a prime location for implementing REDD+. National REDD+ policy processes are ongoing and many REDD+ pilot initiatives are being demonstrated. However, the level of national engagement, progress and distribution of REDD+ activities varies considerably in the different Congo Basin countries. This study therefore uses a set of criteria to assess national and international policy initiatives and approaches for advancing REDD+ implementation in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), two countries where more than two thirds of the Congo Basin forests are concentrated. Our findings show that (i) both countries have shown the highest political presence at the international climate negotiations but DRC has invested more in the size of its delegation and side events; (ii) REDD+ donors, initiatives, and funding are disproportionately skewed towards DRC making it technically more advanced; (iii) the high political interest and institutional reforms in DRC favors private sector investments in REDD+ programs; and (iv) the REDD+ policy process is internally-driven in Cameroon with a strong national ownership, while it is externally-driven in DRC with weak national ownership. To advance REDD+, the government of DRC should embark on capacity building programs that ensure the transfer of REDD+ technical know-how from international to national actors while Cameroon needs to speed-up governance reforms and be more flexible in order to attract influential international REDD+ actors. This paper further provides specific recommendations. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has been partially attributed to agricultural expansion by deforestation, while the pressure to assure food, fiber and energy for the future generations leads to the intensification of agricultural systems. The transition to more efficient systems is actually considered an important strategy to reduce deforestation and to spare land for other uses, including the recovery of environmental services and ecohydrological processes in the drainage basin such as carbon sink and water regulation. The Brazilian Federal Program for Low Carbon Agriculture (ABC Program) intends to reduce carbon emissions by stimulating technological processes that neutralize emissions or enhance the sinking of greenhouse gases. A pilot farm has been established to assess an intensive animal-plant farming system that incorporates anaerobic digestion for biogas, power generation and organic fertilizer production. Emergy Synthesis was chosen as a methodological tool to assess and to diagnosis the farm system design. The modified emergy assessment including externalities (greenhouse gas emissions) improves the understanding of integrated crop-livestock systems efficiency in internal recycling of nutrients and power conversion. The adoption of manure treatment in intensified agricultural systems can effectively contribute to enhance environmental and economic performances. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The greater part of the semi-deciduous moist forests of the Congo basin has been given to logging companies for exploitation. In the next decades, very few of these forests will remain intact. In this paper, we aimed to identify large-scale variations in the structure, composition and functioning of African moist forests that could serve as a baseline for both management and conservation purposes. Commercial forest inventory data were assembled for 49,711 0.5-ha plots, covering an area of more than six million hectares, crossing the borders of Cameroon, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo. Floristic composition was analyzed for a subset of 176 genera reliably identified in the field. Three key functional traits of tropical trees: regeneration guild, leaf phenology, and wood specific gravity, were collected at the species level from various sources, and assigned at the genus level. We first investigated the main variations in forest structure and composition, and identified seven forest types based on these variations. Differences in the percentage of pioneer and deciduous stems, and mean wood specific gravity were tested between forest types. Most of the study area was composed of a mosaic of the structural variations of the forests characterized by the occurrence of Celtis (Ulmaceae) species, which are mostly composed of frequent and abundant genera that formed the common floristic pool of the region. Secondary Musanga (Moraceae) forest is located in repeatedly disturbed areas, along roads and around main cities; mixed Manilkara (Sapotaceae) forest covers a huge area in the southern Central African Republic and in the northern Republic of Congo; and monodominant Gilbertiodendron (Fabaceae) forest is sparsely distributed along rivers. The contrasted structure, composition, and functioning of the forest types imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for adapted management and conservation strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: Sugarcane cultivation is associated with catchment-wide impacts related to application of vinasse, a nutrient-dense effluent with high eutrophication potential. We evaluated the potential for biochar (charcoal produced from pyrolyzed filtercake) to mitigate carbon and nutrient leaching in a cultivated Brazilian Ferralsol after vinasse application. Methods: Twelve soil columns (soil alone [S], soil with vinasse [SV], soil with vinasse and biochar [SVB], and soil with biochar [SB]) were flushed with water and then treated with water or vinasse. Samples collected via vacuum filtration were examined via UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Results: Biochar attenuated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching in soil (S vs. SB) as well as in relation to vinasse application (SV vs. SVB). Biochar-amended soil preferentially retained high-molecular weight, humic-like DOC species, as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy and optical indices, but did not retain low-weight amino acid-like species. Vinasse application also increased total NO3- flux, which may have been exacerbated by biochar co-application. Conclusions: Vinasse treatment strongly affects carbon and NO3- fluxes in this tropical soil. Biochar attenuated DOC leaching, likely through stabilization of complex compounds already present in soil, but did not lessen NO3- fluxes. Thus, biochar amendments in vinasse application areas may decrease carbon leaching. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A protected area (PA) tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain, often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats. Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10. km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Countries around the world are proactively planning to efficiently and effectively mitigate destruction, and maximum resiliency during a natural hazard. Yet, after each disastrous and most often fatal event, governments are learning how to improve their resiliency plans. This paper examines the recovery phase of natural disasters in developing countries by taking a comparative view of the same process in developed countries. The impact of such catastrophic events on our buildings and infrastructure leave communities in a state of reclamation for years. Following such disasters, strategies have been implemented to recover but also to improve the response for future events in both developed and developing countries. To explore lessons learned across these strategies, this paper examines the disaster and recovery efforts of three natural disasters: (1) 2004 Sumatra Earthquake and Tsunami that occurred in Sumatra, Indonesia; (2) Hurricane Katrina that occurred in 2005 in New Orleans, LA (United States); and (3) 2010-2011 Canterbury/Christchurch Earthquake sequences that have taken place in Christchurch, New Zealand. The post disaster recovery programs are compared and contrasted, as well as the nature and effect of the disaster on the local communities. This research aims to offer new perspective on the approach to disaster recovery while simultaneously offering engineers a prized role to think beyond the code and evaluate a broad range of perspectives towards engineering solutions for disaster resilience. Lastly, this paper aims to uncover any potential cross-pollination of ideas between developed and developing nations to refine future solutions towards disaster resilience. © ASCE.

AB  - This paper evaluates the opportunity provided by global interferometric radar datasets for monitoring deforestation, degradation and forest regrowth in tropical and semi-arid environments. The paper describes an easy to implement method for detecting forest spatial changes and estimating their magnitude. The datasets were acquired within space-borne high spatial resolutions radar missions at near-global scales thus being significant for monitoring systems developed under the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The approach presented in this paper was tested in two areas located in Indonesia and Australia. Forest change estimation was based on differences between a reference dataset acquired in February 2000 by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and TanDEM-X mission (TDM) datasets acquired in 2011 and 2013. The synergy between SRTM and TDM datasets allowed not only identifying changes in forest extent but also estimating their magnitude with respect to the reference through variations in forest height. © 2015 Tanase et al.

AB  - The concept of global ecosystem services has become a powerful paradigm for understanding the link between ecosystem processes and related human activities, which is expressed by the economic and ecological quantification of the services in regards to sustainable development. The role of tropical forests in the global climate system and the uncertainty of the exact magnitude of this complex interaction has become a major concern to the scientific community. In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade. To achieve this target, a set of consolidated remote sensing techniques have served to monitor and calculate the extent of deforestation, which became indispensable auditing tools for conservation, forest restoration and implementing climate change mitigation schemes. © 2011 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Conservation management systems can improve soil organic matter stocks and contribute to atmospheric C mitigation. This study was carried out in a 18-year long-term experiment conducted on a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil to assess the potential of tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)], cropping systems [oat/maize (O/M), vetch/maize (V/M) and oat + vetch/maize + cowpea (OV/MC)] and N fertilization [0 kg N ha-1 year-1 (0 N) and 180 kg N ha-1 year-1 (180 N)] for mitigating atmospheric C. For that, the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and the C equivalent (CE) costs of the investigated management systems were taken into account in comparison to the CT O/M 0 N used as reference system. No-till is known to produce a less oxidative environment than CT and resulted in SOC accumulation, mainly in the 0-5 cm soil layer, at rates related to the addition of crop residues, which were increased by legume cover crops and N fertilization. Considering the reference treatment, the SOC accumulation rates in the 0-20 cm layer varied from 0.09 to 0.34 Mg ha-1 year-1 in CT and from 0.19 to 0.65 Mg ha-1 year-1 in NT. However, the SOC accumulation rates peaked during the first years (5th to 9th) after the adoption of the management practices and decreased exponentially over time, indicating that conservation soil management was a short-term strategy for atmospheric C mitigation. On the other hand, when the CE costs of tillage operations were taken into account, the benefits of NT to C mitigation compared to CT were enhanced. When CE costs related to N-based fertilizers were taken into account, the increases in SOC accumulation due to N did not necessarily improve atmospheric C mitigation, although this does not diminish the agricultural and economic importance of inorganic N fertilization. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although forest conservation activities, particularly in the tropics, offer significant potential for mitigating carbon (C) emissions, these types of activities have faced obstacles in the policy arena caused by the difficulty in determining key elements of the project cycle, particularly the baseline. A baseline for forest conservation has two main components: the projected land-use change and the corresponding carbon stocks in applicable pools in vegetation and soil, with land-use change being the most difficult to address analytically. In this paper we focus on developing and comparing three models, ranging from relatively simple extrapolations of past trends in land use based on simple drivers such as population growth to more complex extrapolations of past trends using spatially explicit models of land-use change driven by biophysical and socioeconomic factors. The three models used for making baseline projections of tropical deforestation at the regional scale are: the Forest Area Change (FAC) model, the Land Use and Carbon Sequestration (LUCS) model, and the Geographical Modeling (GEOMOD) model. The models were used to project deforestation in six tropical regions that featured different ecological and socioeconomic conditions, population dynamics, and uses of the land: (1) northern Belize; (2) Santa Cruz State, Bolivia; (3) Paraná State, Brazil; (4) Campeche, Mexico; (5) Chiapas, Mexico; and (6) Michoacán, Mexico. A comparison of all model outputs across all six regions shows that each model produced quite different deforestation baselines. In general, the simplest FAC model, applied at the national administrative-unit scale, projected the highest amount of forest loss (four out of six regions) and the LUCS model the least amount of loss (four out of five regions). Based on simulations of GEOMOD, we found that readily observable physical and biological factors as well as distance to areas of past disturbance were each about twice as important as either sociological/demographic or economic/infrastructure factors (less observable) in explaining empirical land-use patterns. We propose from the lessons learned, a methodology comprised of three main steps and six tasks can be used to begin developing credible baselines. We also propose that the baselines be projected over a 10-year period because, although projections beyond 10 years are feasible, they are likely to be unrealistic for policy purposes. In the first step, an historic land-use change and deforestation estimate is made by determining the analytic domain (size of the region relative to the size of proposed project), obtaining historic data, analyzing candidate baseline drivers, and identifying three to four major drivers. In the second step, a baseline of where deforestation is likely to occur-a potential land-use change (PLUC) map-is produced using a spatial model such as GEOMOD that uses the key drivers from step one. Then rates of deforestation are projected over a 10-year baseline period based on one of the three models. Using the PLUC maps, projected rates of deforestation, and carbon stock estimates, baseline projections are developed that can be used for project GHG accounting and crediting purposes: The final step proposes that, at agreed interval (e.g., about 10 years), the baseline assumptions about baseline drivers be re-assessed. This step reviews the viability of the 10-year baseline in light of changes in one or more key baseline drivers (e.g., new roads, new communities, new protected area, etc.). The potential land-use change map and estimates of rates of deforestation could be re-done at the agreed interval, allowing the deforestation rates and changes in spatial drivers to be incorporated into a defense of the existing baseline, or the derivation of a new baseline projection. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - Timber logging is one of the main land uses in the Brazilian Amazon. Despite its recognized potential as a sustainable activity, logging is generally conducted in an unsustainable or predatory manner, with significant negative environmental impact. There is increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable practices and reduced-impact logging (RIL) is gaining acceptance as a more environmentally benign alternative to unplanned, conventional logging (CL). Comparisons of these two harvest systems have largely focused on differences in efficiency (financial) and immediate impacts on stand structure, residual timber stocks and the physical environment. Growth and yield simulation models allow long-term predictions about the response of forests to disturbance from harvesting, information that is essential to determine the effects of different management systems and to establish systems for the regulation or control of timber that are compatible with sustainable forest management. We describe the calibration of a spatially explicit individual tree-based ecological model within the SYMFOR/SIMFLORA framework for forests located near Paragominas in eastern Amazonia. Data originated from an experiment comparing RIL to CL within an area of 73.5 ha monitored over a period of 10 years. We evaluated biological realism and accuracy of the model, concluding that forest dynamics are adequately represented. This model was used to evaluate long-term effects of RIL and CL on the forest. Our results suggest that total and commercial volume recovery following RIL are faster than following CL; it takes 10 and 30-40 years to recover total and commercial volume under RIL while under CL it takes 35-40 and over 60 years, respectively. Despite benefits from RIL, as currently practiced this logging system does not result in long-term sustained timber yields, reinforcing results from previous studies indicating that RIL must be combined with appropriate systems for yield regulation. In the absence of silvicultural treatments, the model suggests that successive RIL harvests at current intensities will produce stands dominated by pioneer species groups, with few trees belonging to the emergent species group, and an increased proportion of defective trees in commercial size classes. These changes in stand composition present challenges to the long-term financial viability of RIL as currently applied in the Amazon region. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive peatlands in Indonesia are a major store of carbon. Deforestation, conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere. If these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. To improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands we applied 3D modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+, SRTM) and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements. We demonstrate that SRTM radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra and West Papua. A strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground, which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store. Conservatively, we estimate that at least 55 ± 10 Gt of carbon are stored in Indonesia's peatlands. This amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands. With this huge carbon storage and the current rate of degradation the tropical peatlands of Indonesia have the power to negatively influence the global climate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The vital role of forests in limiting the likelihood of dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chevron shares the concerns that governments and the public have about climate change, and has developed a comprehensive program to manage its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are employing a variety of technologies to monitor and reduce emissions from our operations, and investing in research and development to commercialize new emissions reduction options. As examples of our efforts, we are generating electricity from geothermal power in Indonesia, solar power in the United States, wind power in the Netherlands, and cogeneration in various locations. We are reducing flaring by commercializing stranded gas in Africa. We have reforestation projects in Brazil, Australia, and the United States. We are conducting research on fuel cells, hydrogen storage technologies, and advanced battery technologies, and are involved in several programs to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize carbon dioxide capture and geologic sequestration. Additionally, we have developed the industry-leading SANGEA™ system to inventory and manage our greenhouse gas emissions, and have donated it to the American Petroleum Institute. API has made the system available, free-of-charge, to the petroleum industry. Copyright 2006, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - One of the climate change impact that should be alert by archipelagic state such as Indonesia, is the sea level rise. Sea level rise affects the existence of natural resources as well as human resources. Shoreline retreat and inundation are some impacts that can occur in the future along the coastline. Other problems derived as the impact of climate change such as tidal wave, and tidal flood can worsen the effects of sea level rise. Even, the human pressure on exploiting the nature system, such as urban development and ground water utilization will worsen the impact on existing shoreline. Therefore, taking a study area at Jakarta Bay, it is necessary to develop a spatial model to estimate the shoreline retreat along the coast. The model was developed based on remote sensing multi date analysis in comparison with shoreline retreat model developed using tidal data assessment. The result of remote sensing analysis indicates that the shoreline retreat and inundation occur within the area in contrast to the reclamation project. Reclamation project make the shoreline retreat assessment cannot be accurately examined. The other research on land subsidence justifies the inundation of the coastal area related to shoreline retreat. It seems remote sensing derived model is a good tool for depicting future scenarios of shoreline retreat not only caused by climate change but also by human induces factors.

AB  - In soils in general, the cation exchange capacity is an important factor in soil fertility because it determines both cation retention and selectivity, and in turn controls most of the other soil properties. The main goal of this paper was to estimate the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the contribution of permanent charges and pH-dependent charges and their respective importance in soil CEC as a function of pH, clay and organic matter content in soils. A multiple regression method was developed from 75 samples under different soil management practices. The permanent charge (∼ 140 mmolc kg -1 of clay) estimated by this approach was independent of the analytical method used, i.e. a French method (MF) and a Brazilian method (MB), and is consistent with the presence of 2:1 clay minerals. However, the pH-dependent charges were closely related to the buffering capacity inherent in each protocol (MF protocol using NH4+, and MB using a SMP solution proposed earlier by other workers, both at pH 7). For the MF protocol, the proposed method appeared to be well adapted for reproducing soil component properties under different management conditions. In the soil samples studied, the contribution of organic carbon to negative charges ranged from 12.3 to 55.8% of effective CEC and from 14.1 to 59.2% of CEC at pH 7. However, the clay contribution, notably its permanent charges, can contribute to 31% and more of the CEC in the lower horizons of soil profiles. The proposed approach can accurately evaluate the effective and pH 7 CECs when the MF protocol is used but evaluation is less accurate with the MB protocol. © 2006 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - This paper reviews current knowledge on changes in carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado. First, we briefly characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use, particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems, and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP), reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG; CO2, N2O and CH4) to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies should include the application of an integrated modelling system, comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined changes in soil use and management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) is considered a significant mitigation opportunity. Forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon has traditionally been highest irr the world and, thus, represents a likely target for future REDD initiatives. The paper presents an ex-ante assessment of the potential REDD costs in two of the three largest states in the Brazilian Amazon using official land use and cover change statistics. The two states, Mato Grosso and Amazonas, historically feature largely different land use dynamics. The findings focus on the opportunity costs of REDD and suggest that at least 1 million ha of projected deforestation in Mato Grosso and Amazonas could be compensated for at current carbon prices until 2017. Total costs may differ between US$ 330 million and over US$ 1 billion depending on how payment mechanisms are designed. Implications of payment scheme design for the political economy of REDD are discussed.

AB  - There are few hypotheses to explain local understory diversity patterns. There is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales, but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally. Here, I examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale (64 km2) in a wet tropical forest, and possible factors causing them. Herb richness, diversity, density, and cover were measured in fifty-nine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over Reserva Ducke, Manaus. Herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients. Whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope, Marantaceae density and cover decreased. Density of sedges increased with altitude, but did not vary with slope. Density and cover of Marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content. Pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas Marantaceae richness decreased, richness of both groups increased with cation content. Diversity increased with altitude for Marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes. Some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs, such as the greater abundance of Marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots, where water availability is higher and probably also light, and the greater richness of Marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots. The unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes, instead of in bottomlands, suggest that biotic or litter-mediated controls may be important to set these patterns. © 2006 The Author(s).

AB  - In the context of the ongoing climate change discussions the importance of peatlands as carbon stores is increasingly recognised in the public. Drainage, deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands. Successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential. The blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes. This study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures. The study area is the former Mega Rice Project area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense. Restoration measures started in July 2004 by building 30 large dams until June 2008. We applied change detection analysis with more than 80 ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images, acquired between 2004 and 2009. Radar signal increases of up to 1.36 dB show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction, especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cross-polarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above -50 cm was found. Monitoring peatland rewetting and quantifying groundwater level variations is important information for vegetation re-establishment, fire hazard warning and making carbon emission mitigation tradable under the voluntary carbon market or REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Amazon Basin has suffered extensive deforestation in the past 30 years. Deforestation typically leads to changes in climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycle, and soil degradation. Vegetation succession plays an important role in soil restoration through accumulation of vegetation biomass and improved soil/plant interaction. However, relationships between succession and soil properties are not well known. For example, how does vegetation succession affect nutrient accumulation? Which soil factors are important in influencing vegetation growth? What is the best way to evaluate soil fertility in the Amazon basin? This paper focuses on the interrelationships between secondary succession and soil properties. Field soil sample data and vegetation inventory data were collected in two regions of Brazilian Amazonia (Altamira and Bragantina). Soil nutrients and texture were analyzed at successional forest sites. Multiple regression models were used to identify the important soil properties affecting vegetation growth, and a soil evaluation factor (SEF) was developed for evaluating soil fertility in Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols, which differ in the ways they affect vegetation growth. For example, the upper 40 cm of soil is most important for vegetation growth in Alfisols, but in Ultisols and Oxisols deeper horizons significantly influence vegetation growth rates. Accumulation of vegetation biomass increased soil fertility and improved soil physical structure in Alfisols but did not completely compensate for the nutrient losses in Ultisols and Oxisols; however, it significantly reduced the rate of nutrient loss.

AB  - Background: Arsenic (As) availability in natural environment is related to the element’s adsorption and desorption processes in soils. Total As is better related to available As in temperate soils than in tropical soils. In tropical soils, total As is not very significant in terms of availability, therefore justifying the necessity for studies into As dynamics. Knowledge of As dynamics in soil as well as development of new analytical methodologies involving tropical soils are insufficient and necessary for future mitigation projects. Objective: The objectives of this study were: (1) To adjust methodologies which may assist in understanding arsenate dynamics in tropical soils and substrates; (2) To evaluate the adsorption and desorption of arsenate in soils and substrate samples, and to find a minimum value of arsenate available in soil which is lethal to sorghum plants. Material and Methods: Samples of three soils from Minas Gerais State (YL, RYL, and CS) and two sulfide substrates of gold mining (B1 and B2) were used in the assays. All the material was physically and chemically characterized. Remaining As (As-rem) and remaining P (P-rem) of each material, along with MACP and MACAs (using the Langmuir isotherms), were obtained. After agitation to obtain MACP and MACAs, arsenate was extracted by anionic resin and Mehlich-III to evaluate arsenate desorption of the material retained on the filter paper. Subsequently, arsenate desorption curves for the different materials were obtained, and arsenate availability was determined through a bioassay with sorghum plants. Samples of soils and substrate B1 were incubated with six levels of As doses. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 30 days. The plants were then harvested, dried and weighed. Available As in the soils and substrate was determined by Mehlich-III. Results and Discussions: As-rem level decreased from YL (sandy) to RYL (clayey) soil samples, which always showed lower values than P-rem. Among the soils and substrates evaluated, RYL showed the highest MACAs and MACP, followed by CS, YL and Bl. The results were in accordance with the values observed for As-rem and P-rem and confirm the idea that the ability of the assayed materials to remove As from the soil/substrate solution is higher than the ability to remove P. On the other hand, the binding energy (a) between soil/substrate and As is weaker than the binding energy of P. Given the fact that the studied soils present a real ability to remove As from the solution, only a small part of As would be unavailable considering MACAs as a reference. As-Mehlich-III values were higher than As-resin for substrate Bl. Mehlich-III seemed to be more appropriate to extract labile forms of arsenate in substrate B1 as well as in the soils. Available As by Mehlich-III (26.9 mg/dm3) was considered a reference of As LCL to sorghum plants. CC50 was sensitive to the buffering capacity of each soil, showing values varying from 1.34 mg/dm3 As (clay soil with lower As-rem) to 12.31 mg/dm3 As (sandy soil with higher As-rem). Conclusions: The adaptation of the As-rem and MACAs methodologies was satisfactory and of great value in the study of adsorption, desorption and As availability for soils and mining substrate. Mehlich-III was also satisfactory to estimate available As and was sensitive to soil buffering capacity. Nevertheless, resin can also be used as an alternative. MACAs varied among soils and was higher than MACp. However, As showed higher lability than P. Using Mehlich-III, we determined the value corresponding to CC50 that showed a good reference of toxicity to available As. Outlook: The environmental implications of the As behavior are quite serious. Beside the fact that arsenate is removed very fast from the soil solution, an anthropogenic input of the element, being part of the soil quantity factor, may remain in a reversible form for a long time. As may therefore return to the soil solution and becomes available to plants, animals and the entire environment. Considering that CC50 is the maximum contents of available As the environment can tolerate to allow some vegetal biomass production, the maximum capacity of As immobilization in each soil is reduced when compared to the soils’ MACAs values. Therefore, the maximum and safe values of reference to be used in the evaluation of incidental discharge of the element in soils must be reduced. © 2004, Ecomed Publishers.

AB  - Projects in the forestry sector, and land-use change and forestry projects more generally, have the potential to help mitigate global warming by acting as sinks for greenhouse gasses, particularly CO2. However, concerns have been expressed that participation in carbon-sink projects may be constrained by high costs. This problem may be particularly severe for projects involving smallholders in developing countries. Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia. A typology of transaction costs is presented and related to existing pilot projects. The paper concludes with recommendations to reduce the disadvantages that smallholders may face in capturing the opportunities offered by carbon markets. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In order to evaluate growth characteristics, adaptability, biomass production, nutrient recycling, nutrient distribution and the ability to regenerate degraded land, a trial using four multipurpose tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, Acacia melanoxylon and Mimosa scabrella) was undertaken over two years in a distrophic red yellow latosol (oxisol) following a randomized block experimental design with four replications. At the age of two years, A. melanoxylon and L. diversifolia were the tallest species (5.25 and 4.97 m, respectively) and A. melanoxylon and M. scabrella had the largest diameters at 20 cm from tree base. Mimosa scabrella and A. melanoxylon had the highest dry matter production and quantity of nutrients in the above ground biomass. In all species, the highest nutrient contents were found in the leaves, followed by branches and stems. From all species, the highest Nutrient Utilization Efficiency Indexes were obtained for sulphur, phosphorous, and magnesium; L. diversifolia was the most efficient for nitrogen, potassium, calcium, sulphur, and manganese, while A. melanoxylon was the most efficient for phosphorus, magnesium, boron, iron, and zinc. Litter production levels over a three month period were as follows: M. scabrella > A. melanoxylon > L. diversifolia > L. leucocephala. Litter nutrient content was higher in M. scabrella than in the other species. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to the livelihoods of many people, especially those dependent on agriculture. Adaptation to climate change is a necessity to reduce social vulnerability. The adoption of agricultural innovations presents a suitable strategy to reduce negative impacts of increased inter-annual variability in rainfall and temperature. Focussing on the dominant agroforestry system cacao in the Indonesian province of Central Sulawesi, we investigate the adaptation strategies of agricultural smallholders to El Nico-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related droughts. We apply a triangulation of Rapid Rural Appraisal Methods (RRA), semi-structured in-depth interviews and participatory observations. In addition, results from an intensive cacao-study (n=144) on yields, plot history, structure and location are used. The analysis shows that all interviewed households have been affected by extreme climatic effects such as ENSO related droughts which lead to a decline in agricultural outputs. Our study identifies various types of adaptation strategies on the micro level. Most common strategies are reactive or ex-post adaptations which support the household in coping with the effects of droughts. Further, the study assesses anticipatory adaptation strategies which, if precisely implemented, alter the household’s exposure to future droughts, increase the resilience to cope with changes and reduce the degree of sensitivity of affected households. On the basis of these results we examine why different household types do not implement certain strategies, which could enhance their social resilience. In this context we reveal that the adoption of anticipatory adaptation strategies is strongly influenced by social and human capital. The knowledge transfer - which promotes adaptation - is mainly taking place along ethnic lines and local institutions. For the successful adoption of innovations to cope with ENSO related droughts in the study area, membership in certain ethnic groups, local institutions and networks is of utmost importance. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sustainable ecosystem management of Acacia mangium plantation, the area of which is rapidly increasing in the tropics, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia, becomes more and more important. In this context, abundance, biomass and vertical distribution of soil macro-invertebrates were investigated in a mature plantation of A. mangium in Sarawak, Malaysia. In the present paper, in order to reveal the changes in soil macro-fauna caused by conversion of natural forests to A. mangium plantations, the results were compared with those from a nearby primary forest. While total abundance of soil macro-invertebrates was similar, total biomass was much larger in the plantation than in the primary forest. The prominent factor for such a large total biomass in the plantation was the high abundance of earthworms, followed by isopods and harvestmen with much smaller contributions. The common feature of the communities of these three taxa in the plantation was the absolute dominance by single species. The dominant earthworm species was of the endogeic type that was absent from the primary forest and thought to be introduced with A. mangium seedlings from outside. The isopod flushed in the plantation was a pill bug that occurred in the primary forest, too, and might have been pre-adapted to the vegetation change. The dominant harvestman in the plantation was of the life form different from that of the other species found, and was thought to be supported by the explosive increase in biomass of earthworm and/or pill bug. On the other hand, communities of termites, ants, fly larvae, click beetle larvae and other beetle larvae were depressed by the vegetation change. Thus the major consequence of the conversion of natural forest to A. mangium plantation was simplification of community structure in many taxonomic groups. The major points of the simplification in turn were the explosive increase in biomass of the soil processing earthworm and the litter processing pill bug which may accelerate the mineralization processes. The need for a careful monitoring on sustainability of soil fertility was concluded. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetland restoration projects are currently being undertaken throughout the world for a variety of purposes. The methodologies and on-ground techniques being applied vary depending on the site constraints and project limitations. To assess the range of methodologies currently being adopted worldwide, a 3-month international reconnaissance was undertaken (as part of a Churchill Fellowship) to the USA, Netherlands, Vietnam, Indonesia and New Zealand. The outcomes from this overseas mission are currently being combined with local on-ground experiences at coastal wetland restoration sites in Australia. The coastal sites range from small drainage systems to large sites in excess of 1000 hectares. This paper discusses the current innovative engineering techniques being applied to restore coastal wetlands and how these techniques vary depending on location and desired outcomes. Several restoration sites are discussed. A restored site near Newcastle, NSW is provided as a case study. This site is one of the three largest coastal wetland restoration projects underway in NSW and currently the most advanced on-ground. The primary goal at this site is to create salt marsh habitat for migratory wading birds. The methodology applied onsite is focused on developing the correct hydrologic flushing regime. Onsite data combined with hydrodynamic modelling provided initial estimates of flow patterns. This assisted in determining the land-forming operations, installing on-ground water control structures and providing detailed information to relevant stakeholders. The project has assisted in developing innovative management and monitoring techniques. These include automated floodgates to control tidal flushing and limit mangrove growth, multiple land use patterns to encourage onsite roosting and foraging, and remote monitoring via digital cameras. Tidal flushing has been restored onsite since September 2008 and an adaptive management approach is being applied to ensure that the site evolves in-line with the desired hydrologic and environmental outcomes. Similar techniques are currently being applied elsewhere.

AB  - Results of local-scale surface energy balance observations reveal that latent heat fluxes, Qe, provided by trees are important in the surface energy control of cities. Arboreal species provide different storage latent heat, a characteristic related with the mitigation of air temperature in local-scale provided by them. The aim of this work is to compare heat fluxes in different arboreal species along the day and verify their contribution for thermal comfort inside and outside buildings. The required data are: net radiation flux density retained by sunlit and shaded layers (W/m 2) (collected by tube solarimeters), air temperature and relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and vegetation phenology (size of crown, leaves and foliar area). The measurements were carried out during the day, from sunrise to sunset, in three-day periods, throughout the year, covering different seasons. The energy balance scheme is based in the big-leaf model by Penman-Monteith (FAO056). In the research four tree species were analyzed, chosen from the most used trees in urban forestry in the South-East region of Brazil. Results showed that Qe by each trees varied between 116, 68 and 1208,89 W.h/m 2 during the year. The greatest contribution of trees for the energy balance was observed in the afternoon period. The different results obtained were due to the characteristics of the sample individual, such as structure and density of the treetop, size, shape and color of leaves, tree age and growth stage. Trees with higher tops have a good contribution in the cities, due to their energy consumption and higher solar radiation attenuation. Deciduous species are excellent in sub-tropical climate, because they can reduce heat fluxes in summer and allow them in winter. The trees around building, on streets and parks can reduce air temperature, by diminishing the conductive and convective heat gains. This effect provides thermal comfort and can reduce the energy for cooling of the buildings. These characteristics of vegetation should be taken in account by professionals of the urban built environment to improve thermal comfort outdoors, reducing the effect of heat island so ensuring better quality of life for people.

AB  - Compaction has become one of the main causes of soil degradation in agricultural areas. It is directly related to the soil management system, often requiring decompaction practices to mitigate the problem. This study aimed to determine the duration of the effects of mechanical soil decompaction, e.g., by plowing and chiseling, associated with soil breaking devices on the seeders, for example disks and disk-ripper, to mitigate the compaction of soil under no tillage; soil physical properties and the force exerted by the traction bar were evaluated. The study was carried out in Coxilha, in the north region of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) (28°10'18.7 S, 52°22'39.89 W), on a Red Oxisol. The experiment was installed in 2001, in an area for eight years under no-tillage (NT). In this area, mechanical interventions of soil plowing and chiseling were annually performed, prior to summer crop planting. The treatments consisted of one control (uninterrupted NT for 16 years) and six NT periods (7.5; 6.5; 5.5; 4.5; 3.5, and 2.5 years) after chiseling and plowing in the main plots. In the subplots, two fertilizer treatments were applied in the sowing furrow (disks or disk-ripper). The experiment was evaluated in a randomized block design in split plots and three replications. Results indicated the existence of soil compaction in the subsurface layer (7-15 cm), evidenced by increases in soil density and reduction in soil total porosity and macroporosity in all treatments. It was observed that the effects of mechanical intervention to mitigate compaction and improve the soil structure were ephemeral, with a durability of up to two and a half years after chiseling for total porosity and macroporosity and for soil density in the plowing treatments. For the other parameters, these benefits were no longer detectable less than two and a half years after intervention. Mechanical intervention caused no alterations in the force exerted by the traction bar, in comparison with the control. However, the soil breaking mechanism of the disk-ripper on the seeder was effective in altering the appraised parameters, increasing soil macroporosity and reducing microporosity, soil density and traction force, thus mitigating soil compaction.

AB  - Seedling dynamics are crucial for understanding spatial plant distribution patterns, yet little is known about seedling establishment in Neotropical savannas because empirical studies at the community level are scarce. Over 2 years, we studied the recruitment and survival of an initial seedling assemblage and three cohorts of recruits of woody plants within 216 plots of 1 m 2 located along a tree density gradient in the savannas of central Brazil. These savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover, from closed (high canopy cover) to open savannas (low canopy cover), and are located along shallow topographic gradients. We measured community-wide seedling limitation (i.e. proportion of 1-m 2 plots without seedlings of any woody species), photosynthetic photon flux density, litter cover, soil moisture and soil nutrients in each savanna type. Because closed savannas had lower PPFD and higher leaf litter cover than open savannas, we evaluated the effects of light level and litter cover on seedling emergence of nine dominant savanna woody species under controlled conditions in a glasshouse. Density, recruitment and survival of seedlings decreased over time because of mortality in all savanna types, but they were consistently higher in closed than in open savannas. Community-wide seedling limitation was significantly lower in closed (0.16 ± 0.03) than in open (0.30 ± 0.05) savannas. In the glasshouse, high litter cover and very low light levels reduced seedling emergence of most species, suggesting an adaptation to delay seed germination until the wet season when soil water availability is high and leaf litter rapidly decomposes. Synthesis: In Neotropical savannas, tree canopy cover facilitates seedling establishment of woody species by reducing stressful environmental conditions. In particular, low irradiance and high litter cover in closed savannas enhance the recruitment and survival of woody seedlings relative to open savannas by reducing soil water deficits and increasing nutrient availability in the upper soil layers. The higher seedling limitation of tree species in open than in closed savannas contributes to maintain relatively different balances between trees and herbaceous plants along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas and helps to explain spatial distribution patterns of woody species in these ecosystems. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - This paper describes an application of multiple criteria analysis (MCA) in assessing criteria and indicators adapted for a particular forest management unit. The methods include: ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons. These methods were used in a participatory decision-making environment where a team representing various stakeholders and professionals used their expert opinions and judgements in assessing different criteria and indicators (C&I) on the one hand, and how suitable and applicable they are to a forest management unit on the other. A forest concession located in Kalimantan, Indonesia, was used as the site for the case study. Results from the study show that the multicriteria methods are effective tools that can be used as structured decision aids to evaluate, prioritize, and select sets of C&I for a particular forest management unit. Ranking and rating approaches can be used as a screening tool to develop an initial list of C&I. Pairwise comparison, on the other hand, can be used as a finer filter to further reduce the list. In addition to using these three MCA methods, the study also examines two commonly used group decision-making techniques, the Delphi method and the nominal group technique. Feedback received from the participants indicates that the methods are transparent, easy to implement, and provide a convenient environment for participatory decision-making.; This paper describes an application of multiple criteria analysis (MCA) in assessing criteria and indicators adapted for a particular forest management unit.

AB  - Natural resource management research has to evolve from a focus on plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, with a large number of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural resource management problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in local environmental services, but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management. Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people?

AB  - Since the introduction of Stylosanthes, a range legume, in India in early seventies extensive efforts have been made for its evaluation and adaptation. However limited germplasm and narrow genetic base were major impediments in its wider adaptations. Of late, introduction of several new improved germplasm including newly identified species, cultivars and bred materials from Australia, Colombia, Brazil and Ethiopia and their evaluation at selected centers under different agro-climatic conditions improved the existing scenario as many lines including S. scabra RRR as well as newly introduced species S. seabrana has shown great promise for diverse agro-climatic zones. Because of concerted efforts which was largely generated from the recently concluded Austrialian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) stylo project and background study during the period of early eighties Stylosanthes has been considered as the most important tropical legume which not only improve the soil fertility but also provide nutritive forage. Two species namely S. hamata and S. scabra largely contribute to the supply of forages for cattle, buffalo, goats and sheep. As a nitrogen fixing legume, the plant helps replenish soil nutrients when used in ley farming, mixed and inter-cropping systems. The scenario has largely changed due to the better performance of newly introduced S. seabrana species which possessed high seedling vigour, high nutritional parameters and better adaptation under rainfed situations in heavy clay and cracking soil types. It provides good foliage and being erect and low sticky in nature showed compatibility for mixed cropping. Results also demonstrated reasonable yield in first year by all four major species which ultimately geared up in second year of growth. This was stable in S. hamata and S. viscosa for another two years whereas other two species namely S. scabra and S. seabrana indicated enhanced yield in consecutive years. © Triveni Enterprises.

AB  - Adapted tree+grass combinations make a valuable contribution to forage production in the Indian peninsula, but knowledge of the interactive effects between trees and grasses on their production is limited. We, therefore, conducted a field experiment involving combinations of four trees and grasses, besides monospecific grass controls, for seven years, to investigate grass productivity in association with leguminous and non-leguminous multipurpose trees (MPT) having disparate canopy architecture, and to assess the end-of-rotation soil fertility changes. Post rotation changes in herbage productivity were evaluated by growing teosinte (Zea mexicana) for three years. The four MPTs were Acacia auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala. Grasses included Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid napier), Brachiaria ruziziensis (congo signal), Panicum maximum (guinea grass) and teosinte. Lower tree branches were pruned from fifth year. Understorey herbage production increased until three years in all tree+grass combinations, but declined subsequently, as tree crowns expanded. Overall, casuarina among MPTs, and hybrid napier and guinea grass among forage crops, were more productive than others. Pruning MPTs generally favoured greater herbage production. Understorey light levels for acacia, ailanthus, casuarina and leucaena were 17, 60, 55 and 55% of that in the open at five years. During the post-rotation phase, MPT plots were characterised by higher soil nutrient capital and consequently teosinte yields were higher than in the treeless control treatment. All previous tree-grass combinations showed an increasing trend till two years after MPT felling. Yield levels declined subsequently, despite at variable rates. Careful selection of the tree and grass components is, therefore, crucial for optimising herbage productivity in silvopastoral systems.

AB  - Background: Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.Results: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year periods of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by > 20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C ha -1, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas.Conclusions: Estimates of source data uncertainties are essential for REDD+. Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions. © 2011 Morton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Indonesia has responded to worldwide concern about climate change by committing to significant carbon emissions reductions over the next decade. Achievement of this goal will face significant practical obstacles, and the opportunity cost of avoided deforestation is considerable. In our second Policy Dialogue, two climate change experts present contributions to the debate. This exchange could not be more timely, given Norway's recent offer of substantial development assistance to Indonesia in return for reductions in deforestation and forest degradation. In this first contribution, Adam Schwarz canvasses abatement options and out-lines barriers to abatement and its measurement. These include capacity and data constraints, obstacles posed by decentralisation, and problems in identifying and measuring the costs of abatement measures.

AB  - We used life cycle assessment to evaluate a subset of the cradle-to-destination-port environmental impacts associated with the production, processing, and transportation of frozen, packaged Indonesian tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets to ports in Chicago and Rotterdam. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lakebased production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study. © 2010 by Yale University.

AB  - Information on the distribution, level of fragmentation, extent and ecosystem health of tropical forests is key for sustainable landscape management. Therefore, information generated from different types of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors is key to monitoring programs that aimed to link ecosystems dynamics to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. This is especially significant for emerging tropical secondary forests which may play key roles on programs aimed to mitigate the effects of climate change. In this context, the aim of this presentation is to evaluate the accuracy of Chris/Proba and non - parametric classification as tools to monitor the ecological succession processes in tropical dry forests in Brazil (Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, Minas Gerais). Our results from the non - parametric approach were separated into an age class map indicating the probably that a given pixel belongs to a forest succession class.

AB  - The Brazilian coastal regions have been highly modified by intense, diversified and extensive use along its history. These changes were caused, m ore recently, by increasing urbanization and tourism. This study builds scenarios following landscape ecology concepts to interpret the changes and the impacts in the coastal ecotone of São Sebastião Island (São Paulo, Brazil). In such a way, literature surveys of the coastal environment uses and occupation of the island throughout five centuries of occupation have been conducted. Changes in the last fourteen years were analyzed by interpreting and overlapping satellite images (GIS Idrisi Kilimanjaro). The methodology was adapted from Fujihara et al. (2005). The results showed that the largest percentages of human alterations in the island landscape were agriculture until the middle of 20th century, followed by urbanization under the 200m elevation. The forest has regenerated above the 200m level due to legal restrictions. These changes have occurred primarily in the last 70 years.

AB  - Evaluation and monitoring are critical to agroforestry (AFS) project management, especially if they aim to contribute to use and conservation of biodiversity and plant genetic resources. A methodology to analyze information used in decision-making processes was developed and applied in a biodiversity conservation project in the Brazilian Amazon. Quality of information gathered at landscape, AFS, species (Bactris gasipaes Kunth, both wild and cultivated varieties) and genetic diversity levels in three dimensions was analyzed. The information at the landscape level was good, while that in the organizational-institutional and socio-economic dimensions was acceptable; information gaps were serious in the genetic-ecological dimension. Ecological and economic functionality assessment based on indicators built upon reported administrative actions suggests that information related to conservation played a greater role in decision-making and management than information associated with use and development. The application of the methodology proved instrumental for enhancing efficacy of decision-making within an adaptive management approach to plant genetic resources use and conservation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study characterized genetically 30 fast-growing rhizobial strains isolated from nodules of Asian and modern soybean genotypes that had been inoculated with soils from disparate regions of Brazil. Analyses by rep-PCR (ERIC and REP) and RAPD indicated a high level of genetic diversity among the strains. The RFLP-PCR and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that none of the strains was related to Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii, whereas most were related to Rhizobium tropici (although they were unable to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris) and to Rhizobium genomic species Q. One strain was related to Rhizobium sp. OR 191, while two others were closely related to Agrobacterium (Rhizobium) spp.; furthermore, symbiotic effectiveness with soybean was maintained in those strains. Five strains were related to Bradyrhizobium japonicum and B. elkanii, with four of them being similar to strains carried in Brazilian inoculants, therefore modifications in physiological properties, as a shorter doubling time might have resulted from adaptation to local conditions. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PFLA) was less precise in delineating taxonomic relationships. The strains fit into eight Nod-factor profiles that were related to rhizobial species, but not to N2-fixation capacity or competitiveness. The data obtained highlight the diversity and promiscuity of rhizobia in the tropics, being capable of nodulating exotic legumes and might reflect ecological strategies to survive in N-poor soils; in addition, the diversity could also represent an important source of efficient and competitive rhizobial strains for the tropics. Putative new rhizobial species were detected only in undisturbed soils. Three species (R. tropici, B. japonicum and B. elkanii) were found under the more sustainable management system known as no-till, while the only species isolated from soils under conventional till was R. tropici. Those results emphasize that from the moment that agriculture was introduced into undisturbed soils rhizobial diversity has changed, being drastically reduced when a less sustainable soil management system was adopted. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Rules governing the REDD (Reductions of Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) scheme have yet to be established. Different national interests compete within the debate on baselines in order to maximize expected gains. The scheme could have a deleterious impact on the carbon market through massive hot air creation (fake emission reductions), and ultimately on the current international climate change regime derived from the cap-and-trade architecture adopted by the Kyoto Protocol. The political economy of avoided deforestation is frequently overlooked as is the issue of additionality, although both of them are more critical with deforestation at national level than they could be with project-based CDM. An alternative REDD architecture which relies on a special fund would not only allow protection of the carbon market against massive flooding by non additional credits, but could also help finance potentially effi cient policies and measures. Sustaining long-term adequate funding is still an issue to be addressed on a multilateral basis.

AB  - LOPA is a simplified way of defining risk analysis for each potential safety functions (SIF) and respective levels (SIL), or LOPA related standards in the field of safety instrumentation for the process industry. What happen in relation to human factors? How to quantify these factors? How measure probability for human error in emergency situation? It is known that the operation team behaviors are different between routine and emergency (extreme stress) moments. Thus, it is proposed to analyze the behavior of operators in terms of risk, seeking responses from the inventory of knowledge and based on social relations at teamwork. This methodology is named as LODA (Dependent Layers of Operation Decision Assessment) and provides a dynamic means of achieving this state of stress and to examine whether the knowledge inventory in the team is sufficient to treat the emergency. Between the dynamic techniques of operational decision, a fault tree is built to prevent states of abnormality, these events are sequenced at different levels. In each series of events, decisions are made using warnings of failure, correcting the process, changing ways to operate plants, perform tasks, and maintain the safety of equipments avoiding calamity. The technique aims to assess the behavior of teamwork and the quality of proposed actions in order to prevent the accident. This technique aims to estimate the frequency of the accident based on the frequency of the human errors and technical failures. This technique aims to examine the consequences of the accident for the company and the community, proposing the installation of barriers to prevent or to mitigate the consequences of great accidents. Some of these safety barriers are management decisions and others are safety devices, that, if installed will change the frequency of accidents. This technique is being applied in the activity of transportation and storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in functions of logistics and safety. This activity logistics and warehousing is located in an urban area of a city at Brazil, close to residential properties and other industrial facilities. The events in the drying and regeneration sections of LPG were chosen to illustrate a simulated explosion situation. These events are since the warnings of abnormalities, such as the absence of flame, until corrective measures to reduce the strength of the fault, and then blast furnace and "domino effect" of others equipments. These events were based on the speech of the operator (occurrence or shift book) and on assumptions (facts extrapolation) about the continuation of abnormalities. The events in chronological order involved in this risk analysis are listed: (D1) warnings from LPG process; (D2) situations of process under-control; (D3) events involved with equipment damage and failure with task perform; (D4) pool fire, explosion of furnace impacting the equipments; (D5) domino effects with explosion of vessels and propagation of fire in direction of spheres and community. When applying these techniques the safety of industrial installation increases. The identification of team behavior under extreme stress allows to choice the correct profile and plans the training for operation team, especially for leaders. The construction of basic FTA includes technical and human factors during decision of operation. The failure tree exercises positioning human factors in the anatomy of accident allows calculation of final probability of great event, the calamity. When using stress method with five layers of dependent decisions is possible to suggest the best barriers to avoid accident.

AB  - Water erosion caused by inappropriate land use compromises the ecosystems and causes economic and social losses. To remedy this, the present study proposes (i) the evaluation of the erosion risk in an Environmental Protection Area (EPA) with the combination of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), soil loss tolerance (T) estimates adapted to Brazilian soils and the legislation; and (ii) control measures from environmental zoning. This was applied to the EPA of Lageado stream, one of the main surface water sources in Campo Grande, Brazil. Several referenced information plans were overlapped and the total area was divided into five zones with different land use profiles, which were determined according to the conservation and preservation of native vegetation, occurrence of wet areas and springs, land use and management, eroded area recovery and occurrence of permanently preserved areas. The methodology proposed was suitable for environmental zoning of protected areas. This protocol can be applied to other areas by including additional variables such as social and economic parameters. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - • Background and Aims: The importance of superficial root mats inside the forest floor for the nutrition of Amazonian rain forests has been extensively investigated. The present study was aimed at assessing the function of a root mat adherent to decomposing organic material observed in Eucalyptus plantations. • Methods: The development of the root mat was studied through micromorphological observations of thin litter sections, and the influence of soil microtopography and soil water repellency on root mat biomass was assessed in situ on an area of 5 m2. In addition, input-output budgets of nutrients within the forest floor were established from measurements of litterfall, dissolved nutrients in gravitational solutions, and forest floor nutrient contents. • Key Findings: The amounts of nutrients released during litter decay in this ecosystem during the period of study were, on average, 46, 3, 4, 19 and 17 kg ha-1 year-1 for N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively. The simultaneous measurements of the chemical composition of throughfall solutions and leachates beneath the forest floor showed a very quick uptake of nutrients by the root mat during the decomposition processes. Indeed, the solutions did not become noticeably enriched in nutrients during their passage through the holorganic layer, despite large amounts of elements being released during litter decay. The root mat biomass decreased significantly during the dry season, and a preferential development in microdepressions at the soil surface was observed. A strong water repellency observed in these depressions might enhance the ability of the roots to take up water and nutrients during the dry periods. • Conclusions: The root mat was active throughout the year to catch the flux of nutrients from the biodegradation of the forest floor, preventing the transfer of dissolved nutrients toward deeper soil horizons. This mechanism is involved in the successful adaptation of this Eucalyptus hybrid in areas covered by 'climacic' savannas in Congo. © 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

AB  - The growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, both under and outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value. If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha-1 in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The general objectives of this study are: (1) to increase the knowledge of the agricultural properties of strongly weathered soils and their spatial variability, and (2) to explore the potential of summary crop growth models together with existing soil maps in modern (quantified) land use systems analysis at regional level, in particular on strongly weathered soils. Part I, is the introductory part, containing this general introduction (chapter 1). Chapter 2 presents a brief review on strongly weathered soils and identifies knowledge gaps in relation to their use potential and management. A brief description of the study regions is given in chapter 3. Part II Discusses the variability of the (apparently homogeneous) soilscapes of the study regions and its relation to the quality of soil maps. Geostatistical methods are used in chapter 4 to quantify the spatial scales of variation of major physical and chemical soil characteristics and addresses the question if spatial patterns detected are characteristic for areas with strongly weathered soils. Chapter 5 evaluates the adequacy of existing semi-detailed and reconnaissance soil maps of the regions for land use systems research. Soil water relations and related transfer functions are addressed in part III. Chapter 6 discusses the applicability of simplified water availability concepts to the strongly weathered soils of the study regions. Chapter 7 investigates if key soil-water parameters, which are difficult to measure but necessary for input in crop growth models, can be predicted adequately by transfer functions on the basis of readily available data. Part IV discusses summary modelling approaches to selected bio-physical processes and the applicability of a crop growth model to land uses systems in the study regions. Chapter 8 reviews how crop water uptake is currently accounted for in summary models of different schools, and looks into the backgrounds of discrepancies. Chapter 9 compares three of these approaches to check if different methods provide disparate results; and suggests improvements. Chapter 10 discusses another important feature of crop growth models, which is the method to describe the partitioning of assimilates among different parts of the crop (roots, leaves, stems etc..) over the growing season. A new approach is proposed and primary tests are conducted for soybeans and sugarcane. Chapter 11 compares biophysical water-limited yield potentials, calculated by a crop growth model (adapted to the findings of the previous chapters) with on-farm yield records from the study regions. Ideally, the differences between model results and recorded data (so-called yield gaps) would be caused by limiting or reducing factors that are not considered by the model, such as nutrient insufficiency, pests and harvest losses. Chapter 12 addresses the question to which extent errors/uncertainties related to water availability assessment in the model or in the input data (originating from unresolved spatial soil variability) may also contribute to inferred yield gaps.

AB  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) programme is poised to radically restructure forest management and politics. The programme will eventually provide $30 billion a year in grant and market finance to prevent carbon emissions caused by forest conversion in non-Annex 1 countries. As a consequence new carbon networks involving investment agencies, carbon traders, government departments and NGOs are forming to profit from the programme. This paper analyses the ongoing evolution of REDD from four perspectives drawn from political ecology – classic political ecology, eco-governmentality, eco-dependence, and environmental justice. I argue that both the dominant global managerialist perspective, that sees REDD as an apolitical technical and programmatic challenge, and the oppositional populist response, that sees REDD as a form of neo-liberal expansionism infringing on forest people's rights, gloss over the importance of place. Drawing from the experiences of two advanced REDD pilot projects located in the Indonesian province of Aceh, I explore the particularities of place in shaping how REDD is unfolding. Rather than rejecting, or uncritically accepting, this new form of green neo-liberalism I argue for more contextualised responses that maximise the social and environmental gains that can be made, while also highlighting the negativities involved. © 2010 Institute for Human Geography.

AB  - Although agricultural expansion is a primary threat to tropical biodiversity, experimental studies evaluating the conservation value of tropical agricultural habitats are scarce. In particular, little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as South-East Asia. We used a two-step approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Indonesia is the third largest cacao-exporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity. We first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a Bayesian model selection approach. Based on these results, we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness (LLT), number of branch piles (LOGS) and LLT + LOGS combinations in the cacao plots. The experimental data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression. The best supported correlative models incorporated LLT, LOGS, air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity. The subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness, and reptile abundance, but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way, providing microhabitat resources. However, the main beneficiaries were common disturbance-tolerant reptiles. Synthesis and applications. The different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations. Increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories. This will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal. Particularly for rare species, native forests remain critical for herpetological richness. The direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and, hence, demand further research. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Forest management poses particular challenges as the pressure on forests is huge due to deforestation. In this context, the establishment of protected areas is a common conservation measure where institutions are put in place and sanctions regarding forest use are enforced. This paper focuses on the practice of sustainable forest management and the associated perspectives of local institutions at the rainforest margins of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Our case study applies a qualitative social science research approach. Interviews and group discussions with relevant actors such as farmers, village authorities, the National Park authority, and non-governmental organization members were conducted. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework served to structure the study and to provide a set of questions to be considered concerning rules, participants, and conservation outcomes. State-induced formal rules are compared with traditional informal rules regarding natural resource use. Our results suggest that the current state-imposed formal rules have not been successfully implemented in the past. Insufficient boundary demarcation, and a lack of congruence between rules and local conditions have been identified as main reasons. Traditional informal rules are rather more respected by local people since they are adapted to traditional use rights and sanctions at the village level. Community conservation agreements (CCAs) are considered a promising tool to mediate between National Park conservation interests and local people's needs integrating traditional informal rules. However, the CCAs implemented in the LLNP area do not address existing differences in perception and behavior of indigenous people and migrants in the area. We argue that this is a central aspect in terms of successful CCA implementation and forest management. Thus, we recommend that the National Park authority should take the cultural diversity of the area seriously into consideration and integrate flexible and distinct socio-cultural strategies into its management processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Amazon River, its huge basin, and the changes in biological processes that are rapidly occurring in this region are unquestionably of global significance. Hence, Global Change Biology is delighted to host a special thematic issue devoted to the Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazônia (LBA), which is a multinational, interdisciplinary research program led by Brazil. The goal of LBA is no less modest than its subject: to understand how Amazônia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system and how these functions are changing as a result of ongoing changes in land use. This compilation of 26 papers resulting from LBA-related research covers a broad range of topics: forest stocks of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N); fluxes of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds from vegetation, soils and wetlands; mapping and modeling land-use change, fire risk, and soil properties; measuring changes caused by logging, pasturing and cultivating; and new research approaches in meteorology to estimate nocturnal fluxes of C from forests and pastures. Some important new synthesis can be derived from these and other studies. The aboveground biomass of intact Amazonian forests appears to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), while the wetlands and soils are a net source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), respectively. Land-use change has, so far, had only a minor effect on basin-wide emissions of CH4 and N2O, but the net effect of deforestation and reforestation appears to be a significant net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. The sum of the 100-year global warming potentials (GWP) of these annual sources and sinks of CH4, N2O, and CO2 indicate that the Amazonian forest-river system currently may be nearly balanced in terms of the net GWP of these biogenic atmospheric gases. Of course, large uncertainties remain for these estimates, but the papers published here demonstrate tremendous progress, and also large remaining hurdles, in narrowing these uncertainties in our understanding of how Amazônia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The sustainable management of areas of logged-over tropical forests requires an understanding of the potential yield from the forest and likely financial performance of the management system. This paper describes an analytical approach that involves the linkage of a simulation model of forest growth and yield to a financial model based on data from a forest concession in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The growth and yield model SYMFOR (silviculture and yield management for tropical forests) was linked to a financial model derived for a forest concession managed under the Indonesian selective logging and replanting system (TPTI). This combined approach was used in this study to predict the likely timber yield for contrasting management regimes and then to calculate estimates of the financial performance described as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) of the forest estate. This approach was used in a study that compared the standard TPTI system with alternatives that combined reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques with alternative systems of yield regulation. The TPTI system regulates timber yield using a single diameter limit given for each type of forest (currently two categories for lowland Dipterocarp forests and one for swamp forest). The alternative systems that were evaluated included one defined by a maximum of eight harvested stems per hectare and others based on maximum volume extracted of either 50 or 60 m3 ha-1. Each of these systems was evaluated for cutting cycle lengths of 25, 35 and 45 years. These management regimes were implemented for a simulated period representing three additional cutting cycles. The impacts of alternative management regimes were compared through statistical analysis of the results from the simulations that was able to remove the effect of the very significant variability between experimental plots. The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the conventional TPTI management system failed to achieve criteria of sustainability for timber yield and financial performance. Average yields dropped from over 80 m 3 ha-1 for the first simulated harvest from the logged-over area (second harvest) to between 35 and 40 m3 ha -1 for the third and fourth harvests. The financial analysis showed that this system was not viable after the second harvest leaving the only financially viable alternative of land conversion after clear felling of the remaining forest. The alternative management regimes based on reduced impact logging and more effective systems of timber yield regulation performed much better. The study suggested that management systems based on a cutting cycle of 35 years with yield regulated to 50 m3 ha-1 or 45 years with yield regulated to 60 m3 ha-1 were the best alternatives to the current TPTI system. Neither of these two alternatives was able to consistently achieve the desired internal rate of return of 16% unless there were also decreases in wastage associated with the harvesting and timber extraction. Optimisation techniques where used to determine the combination that would produce an internal rate of return of at least 16%. This process suggested that the concession studied would be able to achieve or exceed this criterion over all harvests when (a) a management regime involving a cutting cycle of 45 years is combined with a yield regulation system harvesting a maximum of 60 m3 ha-1 and (b) the efficiency of timber conversion increases from 52 to 60%. It is considered that this is readily achievable using existing methods and appropriate training. The methods described in this paper can be transferred to other concessions or countries and may be modified to utilise alternative growth and yield or financial models. The paper also indicates that the approach could be adapted to consider a wider range of goods and services provided by forests to extend the analysis into a more comprehensive economic analysis. A preliminary consideration of these issues demonstrated that the system of management selected on the basis of timber yield and financial performance will also provide benefits for the environment and local communities. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Reducing emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses is considered an essential ingredient of an effective strategy to mitigate global warming. Required changes in land use and forestry, however, often imply foregoing returns from locally more attractive resource use strategies. We assess and compare the prospects of mitigating climate change through emission reductions from forestry and agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon. We use official statistics, literature, and case study material from both old and new colonization frontiers to identify the scope for emission reductions, in terms of potential additionality, opportunity costs, technological complexity, transaction costs, and risks of economic and environmental spillover effects. Our findings point to a comparative advantage in the Brazilian Amazon of forest conservation-based over land-use modifying mitigation options, especially in terms of higher potential additionality in emission reductions. Low-cost mitigation options do exist also in use-modifying agriculture and forestry, but tend to be technologically complex thus requiring more costly intervention schemes. Our review points to a series of regional development deficits that may come to hamper attempts to tap into the large-scale climate change mitigation potential often associated with the Amazon. Low-hanging fruits for mitigation do exist, but must be carefully identified based on the performance indicators we discuss. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The history of conifers introduced earlier elsewhere in the southern hemisphere suggests that recent invasions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are likely to increase in number and size. In South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30 years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest, alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate. Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America. Pressure from foreign customers in South Africa has led most companies there to seek certification through the Forestry Stewardship Council; a similar programme operates in Australia. Such an approach may be promising in South America. © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.

AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, large land areas are used for the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which is predominantly grown under the shade of native trees in an agroforestry system locally known as cabruca. As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability. The implementation of our recommendations should be accompanied by appropriate biological and socioeconomic monitoring and the findings should inform a broad program of adaptive management of the cabrucas and the wider cocoa landscape. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute new insights globally and regionally on how carbon forest mitigation contributes to sustainable development in South America. Carbon finance has emerged as a potential policy option to tackling global climate change, degradation of forests, and social development in poor countries. This paper focuses on evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of a set of forest based mitigation pilot projects that emerged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The paper reviews research conducted in 2001-2002, drawing from empirical data from four pilot projects, derived from qualitative stakeholder interviews, and complemented by policy documents and literature. Of the four projects studied three are located in frontier areas, where there are considerable pressures for conversion of standing forest to agriculture. In this sense, forest mitigation projects have a substantial role to play in the region. Findings suggest however, that all four projects have experienced cumbersome implementation processes specifically, due to weak social objectives, poor communication, as well as time constraints. In three out of four cases, stakeholders highlighted limited local acceptance at the implementation stages. In the light of these findings, we discuss opportunities for implementation of future forest based mitigation projects in the land use sector. © 2007.

AB  - The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 × 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs - readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability. Copyright © 2004 by the author(s).

AB  - The increasing anthropogenic pressure in the rare rupestrian fields in southeastern Brazil has led to the expansion of degraded areas on the extremely nutrient-deficient quartzitic soils. On the other hand, the use of rupestrian field native species in reclamation programmes has been hampered by the lack of studies involving seedling physiological ecology. The present study evaluated biomass allocation and seedling growth rate during early seedling growth of four Fabaceae shrubs: Collaea cipoensis, Calliandra fasciculata, Chamaecrista ramosa, and Mimosa foliolosa. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) species proportionally allocate higher biomass to the roots, presenting a high root/shoot ratio; and (ii) species exhibit low phenotypic variation because they have adapted to poor nutritional environments. A 12-month greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate seedling growth and biomass allocation performance in substrates with contrasting levels of soil fertility. The four species studied presented values of root/shoot ratio lower than one in both fertility conditions of the substrate. Growth parameters for Collaea and Calliandra increased with increasing soil fertility, while no differences were observed for Mimosa and Chamaecrista. Although the four species are naturally adapted to low nutritional quality soils, seedling development was not hindered by high fertility substrate conditions. Despite the remarkable differences in fertility between the substrates, the responsiveness in growth and allocation in Chamaecrista and Mimosa was lower than that expected if the species would exhibit high phenotypic variation. The implications for rupestrian field restoration are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the tropics, reforestations and agroforestry become increasingly important and may help mitigate climate change. However, high water use by trees may deplete water resources for associated crops or other purposes. Choice of tree species might reduce water use rates to acceptable levels, but available information on species-specific water use characteristics is scarce. We addressed the following questions: 1) do species differ in xylem sap flux response to fluctuating environmental conditions, 2) are there species-specific differences in quantities of water used, and specifically 3) do universal rules relating tree size to water use apply? This chapter combines data on tree sap flux and water use gathered in Indonesia, Panama and the Philippines. These studies applied the same methods and were conducted in recently established stands (5–12 years old when studied) characterised by small diameter trees and relatively simple stand structure. We analyse data from more than 100 trees belonging to 17 species using a simple sap flux model. Model application suggested species-specific differences in parameters such as maximal sap flux velocity and responses to radiation and vapour pressure deficit. With respect to the quantity of water used per tree, we observed a strong correlation between tree diameter and tree water use, which confirms earlier publications. However, e.g. in the stands in the Philippines where tree diameter explained 65% of observed variation, some species clearly followed distinct trajectories. For a given diameter, up to twofold differences in tree water use among species were observed. Our findings thus support the idea that species selection can be used to control tree water use of future reforestations and within agroforestry Teja Tscharntke, Christoph Leuschner, Edzo Veldkamp, Heiko Faust, Edi Guhardja, Arifuddin Bidin (editors): Tropical rainforests and agroforests under global change: Ecological and socio-economic valuations.

AB  - The study responds to the demand for the cultivation of exploited native tree species of the Amazon for high quality timber production in plantations. The relationship of the light availability, the water and nutrient content of the soil, the net photosynthesis and the biomass production of one- to eight-year-old Swietenia macrophylla King (true mahogany), Carapa guianensis Aubl. (Andiroba), and Cedrela odorata L. (Cedro) was investigated on natural sites and in plantations in the states of Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Gas exchange measurements showed that the net photosynthesis of Swietenia and Cedrela strongly depends on a high water and K content of the soil, while the net photosynthesis of Carapa was less influenced by the water and K content of the soil. Maximum water uptake of Swietenia was found in wet soils with a soil water potential of -3 to -5 kPa, of Carapa in soils with a soil water potential of -25 to -28 kPa and of Cedrela in soils with a soil water potential of -7 to -8 kPa. The water uptake of all three species decreased with decreasing K content of the soil (range of soil K content: 4-16 mg kg-1), but the water uptake of Carapa was less influenced by the water potential and the K content of the soil compared to Swietenia and Cedrela. The K uptake of all three species increased with increasing K content of the soil. The K uptake of Swietenia and Cedrela strongly depended on a high water content of the soil, whereas Carapa took up considerable amounts of K also in drier soils. The biomass production of Swietenia, Carapa, and Cedrela could be calculated by a growth model derived from the relationship between the photoactive radiation, the soil water potential, the K content of the soil and the water and K uptake and the net photosynthesis of the three species with an accurracy of 65 % to 72 %. The reliability of the growth model was tested under field conditions with 256 plants each of Swietenia, Carapa, and Cedrela. It turned out that Carapa is better adapted to poorer soils and changing soil water contents than Swietenia and Cedrela and therefore could be especially recommended for the recultivation of degraded areas, while for sustainable timber production of Swietenia and Cedrela on degraded areas a careful plantation managment and fertilization are indispensible.

AB  - Solar radiation is an important factor for plant growth, being its availability to understory crops strongly modified by trees in an Agroforestry System (AFS). Coffee trees (Coffea arabica - cv. Obatã IAC 1669-20) were planted at a 3.4 x 0.9 m spacing inside and aside rows of monocrops of 12 year-old rubber trees (Hevea spp.), in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil (22° 42'30'' S, 47°38'00'' W - altitude: 546m). One-year-old coffee plants exposed to 25; 30; 35; 40; 45; 80; 90; 95 and 100% of the total solar radiation were evaluated according to its biophysical parameters of solar radiation interception and capture. The Goudriaan (1977) adapted by Bernardes et al. (1998) model for radiation attenuation fit well to the measured data. Coffee plants tolerate a decrease in solar radiation availability to 50% without undergoing a reduction on growth and LAI, which was approximately 2m2.m-2 under this condition. Further reductions on the availability of solar radiation caused a reduction in LAI (1.5m2.m-2), thus poor land cover and solar radiation interception, resulting in growth reduction.

AB  - The interception of the rainfall by the forest canopy has great relevance to the nutrient geochemistry cycle in low fertility tropical soils under native or cultivated forests. However, little is known about the modification of the rainfall water quality and hydrological balance after interception by the canopies of eucalyptus under pure and mixed plantations with leguminous species, in Brazil. Samples of rainfall (RF), throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) were collected and analyzed in pure plantations of mangium (nitrogen fixing tree -NFT), guachapele (NFT) and eucalyptus (non-nitrogen fixing tree -NNFT) and in a mixed stand of guachapele and eucalyptus in Seropédica, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Nine stemflow collectors (in selected trees) and nine pluviometers were randomly disposed under each stand and three pluviometers were used to measure the incident rainfall during 5.5 months. Mangium conveyed 33.4% of the total rainfall for its stem. An estimative based on corrections for the average annual precipitation (1213 mm) indicated that the rainfall's contribution to the nutrient input (kg ha-1) was about 8.42; 0.95; 19.04; 6.74; 4.72 and 8.71 kg ha-1 of N-NH4+, P, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2 and Na+, respectively. Throughfall provided the largest contributions compared to the stemflow nutrient input. The largest inputs of N-NH4+ (15.03 kg ha-1) and K+ (179.43 kg ha-1) were observed under the guachapele crown. Large amounts of Na+ denote a high influence of the sea. Mangium was the most adapted species to water competitiveness. Comparatively to pure stand of eucalyptus, the mixed plantation intensifies the N, Ca and Mg leaching by the canopy, while the inputs of K and P were lower under these plantations.

AB  - Criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable forest management are important tools to improve the quality of forest management. In most cases they have been developed by experts, but the participation of stakeholders is essential if the C&I are to be locally relevant and practicable. We asked four stakeholder groups to apply a set of C&I to a forest management unit in the eastern Amazon basin. The study confirmed the importance of involving stakeholders and demonstrated that effective efforts begin with well-defined and clearly understandable C&I. Stakeholders were better able to apply and adapt measurable verifiers than the more abstract indicators and criteria. Intensive communication about personal experiences and subjective interpretations is necessary to prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Our study also confirmed the general practical applicability of C&I and revealed their potential as instruments of communication and learning.

AB  - Sustainable production and biodiversity conservation can be mutually supportive in providing multiple ecosystem services to farmers and society. This study aimed to determine the contribution of agroforestry systems, as tested by family farmers in the Brazilian Rainforest region since 1993, to tree biodiversity and evaluated farmers' criteria for tree species selection. In addition, long-term effects on microclimatic temperature conditions for coffee production and chemical and biological soil characteristics at the field scale were compared to full-sun coffee systems. A floristic inventory of 8 agroforests and 4 reference forest sites identified 231 tree species in total. Seventy-eight percent of the tree species found in agroforests were native. The variation in species composition among agroforests contributed to a greater γ-diversity than α-diversity. Monthly average maximum temperatures were approximately 6. °C higher in full-sun coffee than in agroforests and forests. Total soil organic C, N mineralization and soil microbial activity were higher in forests than in coffee systems, whereas the chemical and biological soil quality in agroforests did not differ significantly from full-sun coffee after 13 years. Given its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and its capacity to adapt coffee production to future climate change, coffee agroforestry offers a promising strategy for the area. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To mitigate soil erosion and enhance soil fertility in orange plantations, the permanent protection of the inter-rows by cover species has been suggested. The objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in the microbial biomass, due to different soil tillage systems and intercropped cover species between rows of orange trees. The soil of the experimental area previously used as pasture (Brachiaria humidicola) was an Ultisol (Typic Paleudult) originating from Caiuá sandstone in the northwestern part of the State of Paraná, Brazil. Two soil tillage systems were evaluated: conventional tillage (CT) in the entire area and strip tillage (ST) (strip width 2 m), in combination with different ground cover management systems. The citrus cultivar 'Pera' orange (Citrus sinensis) grafted onto 'Rangpur' lime rootstock was used. Soil samples were collected after five years of treatment from a depth of 0-15 cm, under the tree canopy and in the inter-row, in the following treatments: (1) CT and an annual cover crop with the leguminous species Calopogonium mucunoides; (2) CT and a perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut Arachis pintoi; (3) CT and an evergreen cover crop with Bahiagrass Paspalum notatum; (4) CT and a cover crop with spontaneous Brachiaria humidicola grass vegetation; and (5) ST and maintenance of the remaining grass (pasture) of Brachiaria humidicola. Soil tillage and the different cover species influenced the microbial biomass, both under the tree canopy and in the interrow. The cultivation of brachiaria increased C and N in the microbial biomass, while bahiagrass increased P in the microbial biomass. The soil microbial biomass was enriched in N and P by the presence of ground cover species and according to the soil P content. The grass species increased C, N and P in the soil microbial biomass from the inter-row more than leguminous species.

AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or aboveground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance. This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery. The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges. For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km 2 appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarão Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.

AB  - Background. Arsenic (As) availability in natural environment is related to the element's adsorption and desorption processes in soils. Total As is better related to available As in temperate soils than in tropical soils. In tropical soils, total As is not very significant in terms of availability, therefore justifying the necessity for studies into As dynamics. Knowledge of As dynamics in soil as well as development of new analytical methodologies involving tropical soils are insufficient and necessary for future mitigation projects. Objective. The objectives of this study were: (1) To adjust methodologies which may assist in understanding arsenate dynamics in tropical soils and substrates; (2) To evaluate the adsorption and desorption of arsenate in soils and substrate samples, and to find a minimum value of arsenate available in soil which is lethal to sorghum plants. Material and Methods. Samples of three soils from Minas Gerais State (YL, RYL, and CS) and two sulfide substrates of gold mining (B1 and B2) were used in the assays. All the material was physically and chemically characterized. Remaining As (As-rem) and remaining P (P-rem) of each material, along with MACp and MACAs (using the Langmuir isotherms), were obtained. After agitation to obtain MACp and MACAs, arsenate was extracted by anionic resin and Mehlich-III to evaluate arsenate desorption of the material retained on the filter paper. Subsequently, arsenate desorption curves for the different materials were obtained, and arsenate availability was determined through a bioassay with sorghum plants. Samples of soils and substrate B1 were incubated with six levels of As doses. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 30 days. The plants were then harvested, dried and weighed. Available As in the soils and substrate was determined by Mehlich-III. Results and Discussions. As-rem level decreased from YL (sandy) to RYL (clayey) soil samples, which always showed lower values than P-rem. Among the soils and substrates evaluated, RYL showed the highest MACAs and MACp, followed by CS, YL and B1. The results were in accordance with the values observed for As-rem and P-rem and confirm the idea that the ability of the assayed materials to remove As from the soil/substrate solution is higher than the ability to remove P. On the other hand, the binding energy (a) between soil/substrate and As is weaker than the binding energy of P. Given the fact that the studied soils present a real ability to remove As from the solution, only a small part of As would be unavailable considering MACAs as a reference. As-Mehlich-III values were higher than As-resin for substrate B1. Mehlich-III seemed to be more appropriate to extract labile forms of arsenate in substrate B1 as well as in the soils. Available As by Mehlich-III (26.9 mg/dm3) was considered a reference of As LCL to sorghum plants. CC50 was sensitive to the buffering capacity of each soil, showing values varying from 1.34 mg/dm3 As (clay soil with lower As-rem) to 12.31 mg/dm3 As (sandy soil with higher As-rem). Conclusions. The adaptation of the As-rem and MACAs methodologies was satisfactory and of great value in the study of adsorption, desorption and As availability for soils and mining substrate. Mehlich-III was also satisfactory to estimate available As and was sensitive to soil buffering capacity. Nevertheless, resin can also be used as an alternative. MACAs varied among soils and was higher than MACp. However, As showed higher lability than P. Using Mehlich-III, we determined the value corresponding to CC50 that showed a good reference of toxicity to available As. Outlook. The environmental implications of the As behavior are quite serious. Beside the fact that arsenate is removed very fast from the soil solution, an anthropogenic input of the element, being part of the soil quantity factor, may remain in a reversible form for a long time. As may therefore return to the soil solution and becomes available to plants, animals and the entire environment. Considering that CC50 is the maximum contents of available As the environment can tolerate to allow some vegetal biomass production, the maximum capacity of As immobilization in each soil is reduced when compared to the soils' MACAs values. Therefore, the maximum and safe values of reference to be used in the evaluation of incidental discharge of the element in soils must be reduced. © ecomed publishers.

AB  - Different approaches related with urban flood problems treatment are evolving and there is a large set of possible engineering measures that can be applied. Lately, the traditional approach, focusing on improving channel conveyance, is being complemented by distributed structural measures and nonstructural measures, considering the basin under a systemic point of view and aiming to recover natural flow patterns prior to urbanization. In this context, it becomes necessary to evaluate the potential use of different combinations of the possible interventions, in such a way that the efficacy of these sets in terms of flood mitigation can be optimized. This kind of analysis is of crucial importance and involves technical and economic aspects. Combined effects of the chosen measures may produce a result that is not equivalent to what would be expected from the summation of its individual effects. The systemic behavior of an urban watershed, especially when the drainage system works jointly with flooded urban landscape elements, makes it possible that some design solutions become to act in a noneffective way. Sometimes, different interventions just superimpose concurrent results. On the other hand, it is possible to generate better results, with extra benefits, when proposing adequate combinations capable to join efforts. Mathematical models may act as valuable tools that are able to simulate floods in complex urban watersheds and provide an integrated assessment capability. In this context, mathematical models can evaluate the efficacy of flood control measures sets. In this paper, a mathematical model, based on the flow cell concept, was applied to study the use of a wide range of different flood control measures in the Joana River watershed, located at the northern region of Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. This model is composed by a hydrodynamic core that works together with a distributed hydrologic model. According to the achieved results, it is possible to notice that distributed detention reservoirs - located at upstream reaches, parks and public squares, and also at urban sites - are very important flood control alternatives. It is also noticed that reforestation of slope areas, although some of which are nowadays occupied by lower income communities, is a desirable alternative. Finally, it must be stressed that even traditional flood control measures, presently avoided in many design situations as they may transfer downstream inundation problems, can be important in an integrated flood control project, if adequately combined with other measures. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD/REDD+) have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics. In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land. The results also reveal a bias against Africa and toward Latin America. Unless this pattern is countered, REDD and REDD+ may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Some Eucalyptus species are widely used as a plantation crop in tropical and subtropical regions. One reason for this is the diversity of end uses, but the main reason is the high level of wood production obtained from commercial plantings. With the advancement of biotechnology it will be possible to expand the geographical area in which eucalypts can be used as commercial plantation crops, especially in regions with current climatic restrictions. Despite the popularity of eucalypts and their increasing range, questions still exist, in both traditional planting areas and in the new regions: Can eucalypts invade areas of native vegetation, causing damage to natural ecosystems biodiversity?The objective of this study it was to assess whether eucalypts can invade native vegetation fragments in proximity to commercial stands, and what factors promote this invasive growth. Thus, three experiments were established in forest fragments located in three different regions of Brazil. Each experiment was composed of 40 plots (1m2 each one), 20 plots located at the border between the forest fragment and eucalypts plantation, and 20 plots in the interior of the forest fragments. In each experimental site, the plots were paired by two soil exposure conditions, 10 plots in natural conditions and 10 plots with soil exposure (no plant and no litter). During the rainy season, 2g of eucalypts seeds were sown in each plot, including Eucalyptus grandis or a hybrid of E. urophylla×E. grandis, the most common commercial eucalypt species planted in the three region. At 15, 30, 45, 90, 180, 270 and 360 days after sowing, we assessed the number of seedlings of eucalypts and the number of seedlings of native species resulting from natural regeneration. Fifteen days after sowing, the greatest number of eucalypts seedlings (37m-2) was observed in the plots with lower luminosity and exposed soil. Also, for native species, it was observed that exposed soil improved natural germination reaching the highest number of 163 seedlings per square meter. Site and soil exposure were the factors that have the greatest influence on seed germination of both eucalypt and native species. However, 270 days after sowing, eucalypt seedlings were not observed at any of the three experimental sites. The result shows the inability of eucalypts to adapt to condition outside of their natural range. However, native species demonstrated their strong capacity for natural regeneration in forest fragments under the same conditions where eucalypts were seeded. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plantation forests and second-growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Meteorological parameters were measured in mahogany (mogno)-black pepper (pimenta) agro-forestry sites at Parque Ecológico de Gunma in Santa Bárbara do Pará, Brazil in September 2001 in order to investigate the differences in microclimatic mitigation in relation to forest structure and growth. In site mogno africano (MAF) where African mogno and pimenta were planted four years ago, the tree height (H) was 14.9±0.9 m and the canopy coverage (CC) was 59.40±k9.22%. Likewise, in site mogno amazônico (MAM) where an agroforestry of Amazonian mogno and pimenta has been tested for six years, H was 6.6±0.8 m and CC was 35.48±5.36%. In site mato reservado (RES), which is a 30-year-old secondary forest with 24 woody species, H: 13.3±7.8 m, CC: 72.39±8.23%, and in site roçado (ROC), which was clear-cut 10 months ago, eight perennial herbs and 21 pioneer woody species were found, but CC was the smallest (6.21 ± 1.09%). With respect to the radiation balance, downward short wave radiation (SWdown) was ROC > MAM > MAF > RES, while upward short wave radiation was ROC > MAM > MAF = RES. Both net radiation and photosynthetically active radiation had a similar phase to SWdown. Temperature was also dependent on SWdown. But dew point temperature (Tdp) decreased faster in ROC and MAM than at the other sites because radiative cooling due to upward long wave radiation (LWup) was larger in the nighttime. When temperatures reached Tdp in ROC and MAM, the relative humidity became 100% and the absolute humidity kept decreasing as long as dew formation continued. From these circumstances, it is clear that the diurnal fluctuation of microclimatic environments near ground surfaces depends on CC, and it is believed that pimenta, which are fond of the shade, should be planted in RES with high microclimatic mitigation effects.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are one of the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon, and hence their stability has important implications for climate change1-3. In their natural state, lowland tropical peatlands support a luxuriant growth of peat swamp forest overlying peat deposits up to 20 metres thick4, 5. Persistent environmental change - in particular, drainage and forest clearing - threatens their stability2, and makes them susceptible to fire6. This was demonstrated by the occurrence of widespread fires throughout the forested peatlands of Indonesia7-10 during the 1997 El Niño event. Here, using satellite images of a 2.5 million hectare study area in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, from before and after the 1997 fires, we calculate that 32% (0.79 Mha) of the area had burned, of which peatland accounted for 91.5% (0.73 Mha). Using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, we estimate that 0.19-0.23 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon were released to the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05 Gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. Extrapolating these estimates to Indonesia as a whole, we estimate that between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957 (ref. 1).

AB  - The use of sprinkler irrigation for rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop is a relatively recent practice in Brazil. Therefore, crop soil and fertilization management are still not very well defined. Another problem is the inexistence of specific cultivars adapted to this cropping system. This study aimed to evaluate sprinkler-irrigated upland rice cultivars under different soil management practices and nitrogen sidedressing rates in relation to yield and grain quality. A randomized block design was used, arranged as a 3 x 3 x 5 factorial scheme, totaling 45 treatments consisting of the combination of three rice cultivars (Primavera, Confiança and Maravilha), three soil management systems (disk harrow + levelling harrow, moldboard plow + levelling harrow and no-till) and five nitrogen rates, applied as sidedressing (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha-1), with four replicates. The experiment was set up during the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 cropping seasons, in Selvíria, MS, Brazil, on a Typic Haplustox of clayey texture. Cultivars Primavera and Maravilha presented higher grain yield than Confiança; on the other hand the latter showed higher milled and head rice yields during seed processing. Soil tillage with the moldboard plow and no-till interfered positively in the agronomic and productive characteristics of the crop. In relation to milled rice yield, tilling with the levelling disk + moldboard plow showed better results in relation to no-till. Nitrogen sidedressing did not interfere with the agronomic and productive characteristcs as well as with the milled rice yield of all cultivars. © 2003, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water shortages in many rice-growing regions, combined with growing global imperatives to increase food production, are driving research into increased water use efficiency and modified agricultural practices in rice-based cropping systems. Well-tested cropping systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and management can assist in the evaluation of new agricultural practices. The APSIM model was designed to simulate diverse crop sequences, residue/tillage practices and specification of field management options. It was previously unable to simulate processes associated with the long-term flooded or saturated soil conditions encountered in rice-based systems, due to its heritage in dryland cropping applications. To address this shortcoming, the rice crop components of the ORYZA2000 rice model were incorporated and modifications were made to the APSIM soil water and nutrient modules to include descriptions of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics under anaerobic conditions. We established a process for simulating the two-way transition between anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions occurring in crop sequences of flooded rice and other non-flooded crops, pastures and fallows. These transitions are dynamically simulated and driven by modelled hydraulic variables (soil water and floodwater depth). Descriptions of floodwater biological and chemical processes were also added. Our assumptions included a simplified approach to modelling O 2 transport processes in saturated soils. The improved APSIM model was tested against diverse, replicated experimental datasets for rice-based cropping systems, representing a spectrum of geographical locations (Australia, Indonesia and Philippines), soil types, management practices, crop species, varieties and sequences. The model performed equally well in simulating rice grain yield during multi-season crop sequences as the original validation testing reported for the stand-alone ORYZA2000 model simulating single crops (n=121, R 2=0.81 with low bias (slope, α=1.02, intercept, β=-323kgha -1), RMSE=1061kgha -1 (cf. SD of measured data=2160kgha -1)). This suggests robustness in APSIM's simulation of the rice-growing environment and provides evidence on the usefulness of our modifications and practicality of our assumptions. Aspects of particular strength were identified (crop rotations; response to applied fertilizers; the performance of bare fallows), together with areas for further development work (simulation of retained crop stubble during fallows, greenhouse gas emissions). APSIM is now suitable to investigate production responses of potential agronomic and management changes in rice-based cropping systems, particularly in response to future imperatives linked to resource availability, climate change, and food security. Further testing is required to evaluate the impact of our simplified assumptions on the model's simulation of greenhouse gas emissions in rice-based cropping systems. © 2012.

AB  - Agroforestry systems may play a critical role in reducing the vulnerability of farmers' livelihood to droughts as tree-based systems provide several mechanisms that can mitigate the impacts from extreme weather events. Here, we use a replicated throughfall reduction experiment to study the drought response of a cacao/. Gliricidia stand over a 13-month period. Soil water content was successfully reduced down to a soil depth of at least 2.5 m. Contrary to our expectations we measured only relatively small nonsignificant changes in cacao (-11%) and Gliricidia (-12%) sap flux densities, cacao leaf litterfall (+8%), Gliricidia leaf litterfall (-2%), soil carbon dioxide efflux (-14%), and cacao yield (-10%) during roof closure. However, cacao bean yield in roof plots was substantially lower (-45%) compared with control plots during the main harvest following the period when soil water content was lowest. This indicates that cacao bean yield was more sensitive to drought than other ecosystem functions. We found evidence in this agroforest that there is complementary use of soil water resources through vertical partitioning of water uptake between cacao and Gliricidia. This, in combination with acclimation may have helped cacao trees to cope with the induced drought. Cacao agroforests may thus play an important role as a drought-tolerant land use in those (sub-) tropical regions where the frequency and severity of droughts is projected to increase. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The present work aims at discussing the possibilities of atmospheric carbon emissions mitigation in the scope of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the forest sector using a case study in the Northeast of Brazil. Taking Ceará State as an example and based on the Ceará State Energy Balances for 1980, 1984 and 1987, the Carbon (C-CO2) Emission Balances were drawn up covering these same years. An exercise was carried out in order to draw up carbon emissions mitigation proposals through both Environmental Education and reforestation policies replacing forest clearing. The first, environmental education and forest management practices, involves more efficient practices in the woody sector. The second, reforestation policies, instead of felling native forests for fuel-wood burned to produce charcoal, is discussed from the economic point of view. An estimate was drawn up of the carbon abatement costs, using a case study for charcoal production based on reforestation instead of deforestation, for a ferroalloy plant in Ceará State. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organic matter of a peat core (3.60 m, 7428 years BP) collected from Rawa Danau, west Java, Indonesia, was analyzed to evaluate the early diagenetic fates of lignin in a tropical wetland and to reconstruct past vegetation and climate changes. Vertical profiles of (Ad/Al)v, (Ad/Al)s, and λ8 show that the lignin composition is well preserved in a sub-aqueous environment under reducing conditions. The sedimentary terrigenous plant material at Rawa Danau is comprised predominantly of angiosperm wood. For this kind of tropical, diverse, and dynamic ecosystem, a new vegetation change index called lignin phenol vegetation index (LPVI): LPVI is defined using the lignin phenol composition. This index can sensitively detect terrestrial vegetation changes as well as environmental conditions forcing such changes. The LPVI of the Rawa Danau peat core provides better resolution than other lignin parameters used previously, and reveals four major vegetation change events since the mid-late Holocene. In comparison to other geochemical data (i.e. elemental carbon, isotopes, and hydrocarbons), the LPVI is more sensitive and is able to trace even minor vegetation and climate changes and thus could improve biogeochemical interpretations of peat records. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The intensive use of renewable energy is one of the options to stabilize CO2atmospheric concentration at levels of 350 to 550ppm. A recent evaluation of the global potential of primary renewable energy carried out by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sets a value of at least 2800EJ/yr, which is more than the most energy-intensive SRES scenario forecast for the world energy requirement up to the year 2100. Nevertheless, what is really important to quantify is the amount of final energy since the use of renewable sources may involve conversion efficiencies, from primary to final energy, different from the ones of conventional energy sources. In reality, IPCC does not provide a complete account of the final energy from renewables, but the text claims that using several available options to mitigate climate change, and renewables is only one of them, it is possible to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at a low level. In this paper, we evaluate in detail biomass primary and final energy using sugarcane crop as a proxy, since it is one of the highest energy density forms of biomass, and through afforestation/reforestation using a model presented in IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). The conclusion is that the primary-energy potential for biomass has been under-evaluated by many authors and by IPCC, and this under-evaluation is even larger for final energy since sugarcane allows co-production of electricity and liquid fuel. Regarding forests we reproduce IPCC results for primary energy and calculate final energy. Sugarcane is a tropical crop and cannot be grown in all the land area forecasted for biomass energy plantation in the IPCC/TAR evaluation (i.e. 1280Mha). Nevertheless, there are large expanses of unexploited land, mainly in Latin America and Africa that are subject to warm weather and convenient rainfall. With the use of 143Mha of these lands it is possible to produce 164EJ/yr (1147GJ/hayr or 3.6W/m 2on average) of primary energy and 90EJ/yr of final energy in the form of liquid fuel (alcohol) and electricity, using agricultural productivities near the best ones already achievable and biomass gasification technology. More remarkable is that these results can be obtained with the operation of 4,000 production units with unitary capacity similar to the largest currently in operation. These units should be spread over the tropical land area yielding a plantation density similar to the one presently observed in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, where alcohol and electricity have been commercialized in a cost-effective way for several years. Such an amount of final energy would be sufficiently large to fulfill all the expected global increase in oil demand, as well as in electricity consumption by 2030, assuming the energy demand of such sources continues to grow at the same pace observed over the last two decades. When sugarcane crops are combined with afforestation/reforestation it is possible to show that carbon emissions decline for some IPCC SRES scenarios by 2030, 2040 and 2050. Such energy alternatives significantly reduce CO 2emissions by displacing fossil fuels and promote sustainable development through the creation of millions of direct and indirect jobs. Also, it opens an opportunity for negative CO2emissions when coupled with carbon dioxide capture and storage. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. Bypromoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight oftheir socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Subsistence agriculture systems in semi-arid regions need to adapt management to rainfall variability within the constraints of low-cost alternatives. Organic fertilization is generally the best possible option to maintain soil fertility as the use of chemical fertilizers is unfeasible due to the high cost and risks of drought and crop failure. However, the effectiveness of organic fertilization will vary according to the quality and rate of organic fertilizer application, rainfall scenarios and decomposition patterns. Simulation models can be used for a quick evaluation of management strategies in many possible scenarios. In this paper a newly developed model (SALSA: Semi-Arid Latin-america Simulation model for Agroecosystems), was used to simulate, along a 3-year period, plant productivity and soil fertility in a maize/native pasture rotation system in semi-arid NE Brazil. The model simulated reasonably well the observed maize productivity in the experimental plots during the 3 years of the study, even under contrasting rainfall conditions and application of organic fertilizers of different qualities (animal manure or Gliricidia sepium prunings). However, model simulations of native pasture biomass productivity did not adequately represent seasonal and fertilizer responses, in part probably due to the seasonal variability of the pasture species composition. The model showed that the effectiveness of organic fertilization depended upon rainfall with largest response in years with intermediate precipitation, and lower responses in wet and dry years. High nitrogen leaching and cloudiness reduced fertilizer use efficiency in wet years even at high rates of fertilizer application (20 t ha-1). Fertilization with G. sepium did not increase aboveground maize productivity compared with animal manure, even though it contained twice the amount of labile fraction. This lack of crop responses to a more labile fertilizer is explained by the large fraction of nitrogen that is leached to deep soil which reduced nitrogen availability in the volume of the soil with the largest amount of crop roots. Management strategies that reduce nitrogen leaching or favor pumping nitrogen from deeper layers (agroforestry) would benefit productivity in this system. The SALSA model proved to have potential as a useful tool to help decisions needed to increase organic fertilization efficiency in NE Brazil even though the base information is scarce compared with modern agriculture. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest and land fires are not new to the landscapes of Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, strikingly different perspectives persist about the significance of fires in the tropics to environmental changes and human well-being and consequently how they should be managed. Our synthesis of papers in this special issue suggests both trade-offs and complementarities in various policy responses with differing objectives. There are, however, at least three domains with high potential of meeting multiple objectives. First, is through identification, and improved management, of ecosystems vulnerable to fire under current and future climate. Agriculture, forestry and human settlements on peat land areas in Indonesia are candidates for such a focus. Second, is through building adaptive capacities to manage fire and related land and water resources. Investments in capacity at multiple levels are needed, but particularly at fairly local levels where stakeholders have strong incentives to manage fires appropriate to local contexts. Third, is through building awareness that fire management does not universally equate to fire suppression. Severe smoke haze episodes, for example, are also a result of timing of fires, and some fire-adapted ecosystems may depend on fire to persist. Finally, we emphasize that effective fire management is unlikely to be realized without greater engagement by research and policy with stakeholders in thoroughly exploring the full range of land and fire management options. Negotiation, compensation and trade-offs are probably inevitable. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - Fire is unfortunately an ever-increasing phenomenon in peatlands of Southeast Asia, where most tropical peatland occurs. This paper assesses natural regeneration of vegetation in burnt parts of Berbak National Park in Jambi Province (Sumatra), Indonesia, and restoration trials carried out in the reserve by the forestry department. Six vegetation types are recognised, each representing a different level of degeneration or stage of regeneration. With resources for assisted restoration being very limited, the authors recommend that efforts target degradation types that are unlikely to regenerate rapidly on their own, but where success is likely. Trials indicate that replanting should utilise indigenous species adapted to local conditions such as flooding, and a list of 24 candidate species is provided. Berbak continues to be threatened by fires, and without adequate protection further restoration is not advised.

AB  - Climate change induced droughts pose a serious threat to ecosystems across the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly to those areas not adapted to natural dry periods. In order to study the vulnerability of cacao (Theobroma cacao) - Gliricidia sepium agroforestry plantations to droughts a large scale throughfall displacement roof was built in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this 19-month experiment, we compared soil surface CO2 efflux (soil respiration) from three roof plots with three adjacent control plots. Soil respiration rates peaked at intermediate soil moisture conditions and decreased under increasingly dry conditions (drought induced), or increasingly wet conditions (as evidenced in control plots). The roof plots exhibited a slight decrease in soil respiration compared to the control plots (average 13% decrease). The strength of the drought effect was spatially variable - while some measurement chamber sites reacted strongly (responsive) to the decrease in soil water content (up to R2 = 0.70) (n = 11), others did not react at all (non-responsive) (n = 7). A significant correlation was measured between responsive soil respiration chamber sites and sap flux density ratios of cacao (R = 0.61) and Gliricidia (R = 0.65). Leaf litter CO2 respiration decreased as conditions became drier. The litter layer contributed approximately 3-4% of the total CO2 efflux during dry periods and up to 40% during wet periods. Within days of roof opening soil CO2 efflux rose to control plot levels. Thereafter, CO2 efflux remained comparable between roof and control plots. The cumulative effect on soil CO2 emissions over the duration of the experiment was not significantly different: the control plots respired 11.1±0.5MgC ha-1 yr-1, while roof plots respired 10.5±0.5MgC ha-1 yr-1. The relatively mild decrease measured in soil CO2 efflux indicates that this agroforestry ecosystem is capable of mitigating droughts with only minor stress symptoms. © 2010 Author(s).

AB  - 1. Ecotypes may arise following allopatric separation from source populations. The simultaneous transfer of an exotic plant to a novel environment, along with its stenophagous herbivore, may complicate more traditional patterns of divergence from the plant and insect source populations. 2. The present study evaluated herbivory effects by two Cyrtobagous salviniae ecotypes on two species of Salvinia: the larger S. molesta and the smaller S. minima. Evaluations were based on relative growth rates, biomass production, coverage, and nutrient cycling in a series of complementary and comparative laboratory and outdoor tank experiments. 3. In general, the experiment results indicated that the smaller Florida ecotype of C. salviniae impacted both Salvinia species more than the larger Brazil ecotype. Herbivory, especially by the Florida ecotype, also improved water quality and accelerated nutrient cycling by increasing the rates of litterfall from the standing crops of salvinia. 4. The smaller size of the Florida ecotype may be adaptive by allowing maximal exploitation of host plants via internal larval feeding, which presumably reduces predation risk while increasing damage to the plant. These findings provide support for relying on the suppressive effects of the Florida ecotype in Florida, rather than introducing the Brazil ecotype to counter new infestations of S. molesta.

AB  - Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) and Rapanea ferruginea (Ruiz & Pavon) Mez (Myrsinaceae) are two neotropical pioneer trees with wide geographical distribution in South America, highly degree of adaptation to different soil conditions and intense regeneration in areas with anthropic activities. With the aim to recommend the use Schinus and Rapanea in gallery forest restoration programs, we conducted an experiment with the objective to analyze the capacity of these two pioneer trees to tolerate soil flooding, mainly by accessing the effects of flooding on leaf gas exchange, growth and dry matter partitioning. Seedling survival throughout the 56-day flooding period were 100 and 90% for Schinus and Rapanea, respectively. The mean values of stomatal conductance (gs ) and net photosynthesis (A) observed in the control seedlings were, respectively, 0.4 mol m-2 s-1 and 14 μmol m-2 s-1, for Schinus, and 0.5 mol m -2 s-1 and 14 μmol m-2 s-1, for Rapanea. On day 20 flooding reduced gs and A by 36 and 29% in Schinus, and 81 and 61% in Rapanea. At the end of the experiment, significant decreases were also observed for root and whole plant biomass, in both species. Based on the results, we concluded that seedlings of Schinus and Rapanea can survive and grow throughout a medium period of soil waterlogging, in spite of the alterations observed in their physiological behavior, such as the decreases in stomatal conductance and in whole plant biomass. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Situated in the fast-developing country of Brazil, the Atlantic rainforest Mata Atlântica faces risks generated by population growth-derived problems. Conversion of forest to agriculture has led to a mosaic landscape with fragments of secondary forest in agricultural land. This disturbance to a naturally well-adapted ecosystem prompts rapid soil degradation. Therefore, here we compared soil C incorporation into soil microorganisms and their turnover in typical land-use systems such as primary forest, secondary forest, and agricultural land at the Atlantic Plateau of São Paulo, Brazil. In C 3 and C4 plants having different 13C/ 12C compositions, a C3-C4 vegetation change was induced using maize, a C4 plant. We measured the δ13C composition of individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) because PFLA are specific of typical microbes. Results show that statistical analysis of soil PLFA allow differentiation of four microbial units: (1) Gram-positive bacteria; (2) anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria; (3) fungi, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Gram-positive bacteria; and (4) actinomycetes and Gram-positive bacteria. We also found that soil organic matter is cycled for longer time in primary forest ecosystems, of mean turnover time of 28 years, than in agricultural ecosystems with mean turnover time of 4 years for organic farming and 8 years for conventional farming. Calculation of maize-derived carbon of each microbial unit suggested that fungi and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dominate microbial activity in primary forest whereas Gram-negative bacteria are prominent in the agricultural sites. To conclude, we found that PLFA profiles are sensitive to land-use conversion, and their compoundspecific stable-isotope analysis can strongly discriminate between different managements. © INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

AB  - Shaded perennial agroforestry systems contain relatively high quantities of soil carbon (C) resulting from continuous deposition of plant residues; however, the extent to which the C is sequestered in soil will depend on the extent of physical protection of soil organic C (SOC). The main objective of this study was to characterize SOC storage in relation to soil fraction-size classes in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems (AFSs). Two shaded cacao systems and an adjacent natural forest in reddish-yellow Oxisols in Bahia, Brazil were selected. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes to 1 m depth and separated by wet-sieving into three fraction-size classes (>250 μm, 250-53 μm, and<53 μm)-corresponding to macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt-and-clay size fractions-and analyzed for C content. The total SOC stock did not vary among systems (mean: 302 Mg/ha). On average, 72&percent; of SOC was in macroaggregate-size, 20&percent; in microaggregate-size, and 8&percent; in silt-and-clay size fractions in soil. Sonication of aggregates showed that occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Considering the low level of soil disturbances in cacao AFSs, the C contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. The study shows the role of cacao AFSs in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through accumulation and retention of high amounts of organic C in the soils and suggests the potential benefit of this environmental service to the nearly 6 million cacao farmers worldwide. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects may become eligible under Article 12 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Some of the issues, which need to be addressed, include identifying the types of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities in LULUCF, which could be undertaken as CDM projects. Other issues involve evaluating the mitigation potential and cost effectiveness of the activities, as well as their likely socio-economic impacts and their influence on the national carbon (C) stock. Three broad categories of mitigation activities in LULUCF analyzed in this study include managing C storage, C conservation and carbon substitution. The C intensity of the activities was estimated to range from 37 to 218 Mg C per ha. The highest is in reforested land with slow growing species and the lowest in short-rotation plantations. At a real discount rate of 10%, investment costs required to implement the mitigation activities ranged from US$ 0.07 to 0.88 per Mg C, with life cycle costs ranging from US$ 0.07 to 3.87 per Mg C, and benefits ranging from US$ -0.81 to 6.57 per Mg C. Mitigation options with negative benefits are forest protection, reforestation, reduced impact logging and enhanced natural regeneration, while those with positive benefits are short rotation timber plantation, and bio-energy. Reforestation gave negative benefit since no revenue from wood as trees are left in the forest for conservation, while Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) and Enhanced Natural Regeneration (ENR) gave negative benefits because additional cost required to implement the options could not be compensated by the increase in round-hardwood yield. Other factor is that the local price of round-hardwood is very low, i.e. US$160 per m3, while FOB price is between 250-400 US$ per m3. Total area available for implementing mitigation options (planting trees) in 1997 was 31 million hectares (× 106 ha) (about 40% are critical lands, 35% grasslands and 25% unproductive lands). Total area being considered for implementing the options under baseline, government-plans and mitigation scenarios in the period 2000-2030 is 12.6, 16.3 and 23.6 × 106 ha respectively. Furthermore, total area of production forest being considered for implementing reduced impact logging and enrichment planting under the tree scenarios is 9, 26 and 16 × 106 ha respectively, and that for forest protection is 2.1, 3.7, 3.1 × 106 ha respectively. The cumulative investment for implementing all mitigation activities in the three scenarios was estimated at 595, 892 and 1026 million US$ respectively. National C stock under the baseline scenario will continuously decline through 2030, while under government-plans and mitigation scenarios the carbon stock increases. In 2030, national C stock of the government and mitigation scenarios is almost the same, 13% higher than that of baseline. However, the increase in national carbon stock in both scenarios could not offset carbon emissions due to deforestation.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been suggested as an approach to reduce pasture degradation and, consequently, reduce the deforestation of new areas in the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). This study assessed the contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 19° 35′ 36″ S, 43° 51′ 56″ W; altitude 747 m. The SPS has developed since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees ha-1. The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+). In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole. In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree, forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are unlikely. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Amazonian forest produces environmental services such as maintenance of biodiversity, water cycling and carbon stocks. These services have a much greater value to human society than do the timber, beef and other products that are obtained by destroying the forest. Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved. These include theoretical issues regarding accounting procedures, improved quantification of the services and of the benefits of different policy options, and effective uses of the funds generated in ways that maintain both the forest and the human population.

AB  - Recent research in catchments of rapidly developing countries such as Brazil and China suggests that many catchments of the developing world are already showing signs of nitrogen pollution reminiscent of past experiences in developed countries. This paper looks at both the individual and combined effects of future climate change and other likely environmental changes on in-stream nitrate concentrations in a catchment in Northern Turkey. A model chain comprised of simulated future temperature and precipitation from a Regional Circulation Model (RCM), a conceptual hydrological model (HBV) and a widely tested integrated catchment nitrogen model (INCA-N) is used to model future changes in nitrate concentrations. Two future periods (2021-2050 and 2069-2098) are compared to the 1961-1990 baseline period in order to assess the effectiveness of several possible interventions available to catchment authorities. The simulations show that in the urbanised part of the catchment, the effects of climate change and other environmental changes act in the same direction, leading to peak nitrate concentrations of 7.5. mg. N/l for the 2069-2098 period, which corresponds to a doubling of the baseline values. Testing different available policy options reveals that the installation of wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) in all major settlements of the catchment could ensure nitrate levels are kept at near their baseline values for the 2021-2050 period. Nevertheless, a combination of measures including WWTWs, meadow creation, international agreements to reduce atmospheric N concentrations and controls on agricultural practises will be required for 2069-2098. The approach presented in this article could be employed in order to anticipate future pollution problems and to test appropriate solutions, some of which will necessitate international co-operation, in other catchments around the world. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In tropical forest areas with highly weathered soils, organic matter plays an important role in soil functioning and forest sustainability. When forests are clear-cut, the soil begins almost immediately to lose organic matter, triggering a series of soil degradation processes, the extent and intensity of which depends on soil management. Depending on the level of soil degradation, the rate at which the system can re-establish itself can be slow and may require the use of degraded land restoration techniques. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of pioneer leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees to recuperate degraded land. The area studied - located in the coastal town of Angra dos Reis in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - was planted with seven species of fast-growing leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees in 1991. The nutrient concentrations (Ca, Mg, P and K) and N and C stocks in the soil and litter were determined, in addition to the free- and occluded-light fractions of soil organic matter. Soil samples were also collected from two reference areas: (1) an area of undisturbed native forest; and (2) a deforested area spontaneously colonised by Guinea grass (Panicum maximum). The nutrient stocks in the litter of the restored area were similar to those found in native forest. The recuperation technique used was able to re-establish the soil C and N stocks after 13 years. C and N increased by 1.73 and 0.13 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively. The free-light fraction was highest in the recuperated area and lowest in the deforested area. The occluded-light fraction of the recuperated area was higher than that of the native forest only in the 0-5 cm layer. Both the free-light and occluded fractions were higher in the native forest and recuperated areas than in the deforested area. Since the free-light and the occluded-light fractions are the result of litterfall and decomposition, these results - combined with the data of litter stocks and soil C and N stocks - indicate that the use of legume trees was efficient in re-establishing the nutrient cycling processes of the systems. These results also show that recovering degraded land with this technique is effective in sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversity-the activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Semarang is one of the biggest cities in Indonesia and is nowadays suffering from coastal flooding. Land subsidences, high water tide, and inadequate structural measures play important roles in the coastal inundations. Structural and non-structural methods for controlling coastal flooding including dykes, drainage systems, pump stations, polder systems, coastal-land reclamations, coastal planning and management, public education, as well as the establishment of an institutional framework for disaster management have been implemented in the Semarang coastal area. Although some improvements have been made, the current flood management system has generally failed to address a wide range of coastal inundation problems. Some improvement actions have been proposed including stakeholders involvement on the disaster mitigation. For a long period coastal management, accelerated sea level rises due to global warming should also be taken into account. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80. years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Managing ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a potential 'win-win' scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We measured above- and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha-1 to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha-1 showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels. © 2012 Kessler et al.

AB  - How land-use change and forestry sector options can be used to mitigate global warming will depend on a variety of pending decisions regarding interpretation of the Kyoto Protocol, including treatment of uncertainty. In tropical forest countries, the allocation of effort between plantation silviculture and reduction of deforestation would be influenced by the stringency of requirements regarding certainty. Slowing deforestation offers much greater potential benefits, but the certainty associated with these is much lower than in the case of plantations. In the Brazilian case, deforestation avoidance could produce carbon benefits worth 6-45 times as much as the destructive ranching and logging uses to which the forest is now being converted. Capturing the potential value of carbon benefits from avoided deforestation will depend on increasing our understanding of the deforestation process and consequent ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with the effects of deforestation-avoidance measures. It will also depend on whether carbon credits are defined in terms of a maximum level of uncertainty. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Water uptake and use by plants are essentially energy processes that can be largely modified by percentage of soil cover, plant type; foliage area and its distribution; phenological stage and several environmental factors. Coffee trees (Coffea arabica - cv. Obatã IAC 1669-20) in Agrforestry System (AFS) spaced 3.4x0.9m apart, were planted inside and along rows of 12- year-old rubber trees (Hevea spp.) in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil (22 42'30'' S, 47 38'00'' W - altitude: 546m). Sap flow of one-year-old coffee plants exposed to 35; 45; 80; 95 and 100% of total solar radiation was estimated by the heat balance technique (Dynamax Inc.). Coffee plants under shade showed greater water loss per unit of incident irradiance. On the other hand, plants in monocrop (full sun) had the least water loss per unit of incident irradiance. For the evaluated positions average water use was (gH2O.m -2Leaf area.MJ -1): 64.71; 67.75; 25.89; 33.54; 27.11 in Dec./2002 and 97.14; 72.50; 40.70; 32.78; 26.13 in Feb./2003. This fact may be attributed to the higher stomata sensitivity of the coffee plants under more illuminated conditions, thus plants under full sun presented the highest water use efficiency. Express transpiration by leaf mass can be a means to access plant adaptation to the various environments, which is inaccessible when the approach is made by leaf area.

AB  - Swamp forests are ecosystems restricted to hydromorphic soils which are subject to the presence of surface water due to upwelling of groundwater. The diversity and establishment of plant communities depend on adaptability to conditions of flooding and low oxygen in the soil. This study aimed to characterize aspects of N and P cycling in a swamp forest in Itacolomi Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil, by measuring parameters such as litterfall, nutrient quality and decomposition of leaf litter during the period October 2006 to September 2007. Mean annual litter production was 5.7 t ha-1, with peak production in September. The leaf fraction accounted for 57% of total litterfall, and concentrations of N, P and K were 12.6, 0.616 and 3.07 g kg-1, respectively. Leaf-mass loss during litter decomposition was negatively correlated to soil water content, varying between 29.2 and 46.2%. The N:P ratio of leaf litter suggests that the vegetation grows under P-limitation. Taking into account the evaluated parameters, the swamp forest showed a slower rate of nutrient cycling, mainly due to low litter nutrient quality and slower litter decomposition rate when compared with other wet tropical forests.

AB  - The Cerrado Domain comprises one of the most diverse savannas in the world and is undergoing a rapid loss of habitats due to changes in fire regimes and intense conversion of native areas to agriculture. We reviewed data on the biogeochemical functioning of Cerrado ecosystems and evaluated the potential impacts of regional climate changes. Variation in temperature extremes and in total amount of rainfall and altitude throughout the Cerrado determines marked differences in the composition of species. Cerrado ecosystems are controlled by interactions between water and nutrient availability. In general, nutrient cycles (N, P and base cations) are very conservative, while litter, microbial and plant biomass are important stocks. In terms of C cycling, root systems and especially the soil organic matter are the most important stocks. Typical cerrado ecosystems function as C sinks on an annual basis, although they work as source of C to the atmosphere close to the end of the dry season. Fire is an important factor altering stocks and fluxes of C and nutrients. Predicted changes in temperature, amount and distribution of precipitation vary according to Cerrado sub-regions with more marked changes in the northeastern part of the domain. Higher temperatures, decreases in rainfall with increase in length of the dry season could shift net ecosystem exchanges from C sink to source of C and might intensify burning, reducing nutrient stocks. Interactions between the heterogeneity in the composition and abundance of biological communities throughout the Cerrado Domain and current and future changes in land use make it difficult to project the impacts of future climate scenarios at different temporal and spatial scales and new modeling approaches are needed.

AB  - Background, aim and scope: Regional specificities are a key factor when analyzing the environmental impact of a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the first exporter of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of regional specificities, the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export. The relevant impact categories account for the primary non-renewable energy consumption (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP), the acidification potential (AP), the terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), the aquatic ecotoxicity (AE), the human toxicity (HT) and land use competition (LU). The paper tackles the feedstock and country specificities in biodiesel production by comparing the results of soybean-based biodiesel in Argentina with other reference cases. Emphasis is put on explaining the factors that contribute most to the final results and the regional specificities that lead to different results for each biodiesel pathway. Materials and methods: The Argentinean (AR) biodiesel pathway was modelled through an LCA and was compared with reference cases available in the ecoinvent® 2.01 database, namely, soybean-based biodiesel production in Brazil (BR) and the United States (US), rapeseed-based biodiesel production in the European Union (EU) and Switzerland (CH) and palm-oil-based biodiesel production in Malaysia (MY). In all cases, the systems were modelled from feedstock production to biodiesel use as B100 in a 28 t truck in CH. Furthermore, biodiesel pathways were compared with fossil low-sulphur diesel produced and used in CH. The LCA was performed according to the ISO standards. The life cycle inventory and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) were performed in Excel spreadsheets using the ecoinvent® 2.01 database. The cumulative energy demand (CED) and the GWP were estimated through the CED for fossil and nuclear energy and the IPCC 2001 (climate change) LCIA methods, respectively. Other impact categories were assessed according to CML 2001, as implemented in ecoinvent. As the product is a fuel for transportation (service), the system was defined for one vehicle kilometre (functional unit) and was divided into seven unit processes, namely, agricultural phase, soybean oil extraction and refining, transesterification, transport to port, transport to the destination country border, distribution and utilisation. Results: The Argentinean pathway results in the highest GWP, CED, AE and HT compared with the reference biofuel pathways. Compared with the fossil reference, all impact categories are higher for the AR case, except for the CED. The most significant factor that contributes to the environmental impact in the Argentinean case varies depending on the evaluated category. Land provision through deforestation for soybean cultivation is the most impacting factor of the AR biodiesel pathway for the GWP, the CED and the HT categories. Whilst nitrogen oxide emissions during the fuel use are the main cause of acidification, nitrate leaching during soybean cultivation is the main factor of eutrophication. LU is almost totally affected by arable land occupation for soybean cultivation. Cypermethrin used as pesticide in feedstock production accounts for almost the total impact on TE and AE. Discussion: The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of 10% in the soybean yield, whilst keeping the same inputs, will reduce the total impact of the system. Avoiding deforestation is the main challenge to improve the environmental performances of soybean-based biodiesel production in AR. If the soybean expansion can be done on marginal and set-aside agricultural land, the negative impact of the system will be significantly reduced. Further implementation of crops' successions, soybean inoculation, reduced tillage and less toxic pesticides will also improve the environmental performances. Using ethanol as alcohol in the transesterification process could significantly improve the energy balance of the Argentinean pathway. Conclusions: The main explaining factors depend on regional specificities of the system that lead to different results from those obtained in the reference cases. Significantly different results can be obtained depending on the level of detail of the input data, the use of punctual or average data and the assumptions made to build up the LCA inventory. Further improvement of the AR biodiesel pathways should be done in order to comply with international sustainability criteria on biofuel production. Recommendations and perspectives: Due to the influence of land use changes in the final results, more efforts should be made to account for land use changes others than deforestation. More data are needed to determine the part of deforestation attributable to soybean cultivation. More efforts should be done to improve modelling of interaction between variables and previous crops in the agricultural phase, future transesterification technologies and market prices evolution. In order to assess more accurately the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina, further considerations should be made to account for indirect land use changes, domestic biodiesel consumption and exportation to other regions, production scale and regional georeferenced differentiation of production systems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel+. FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+. Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL+. Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Pará - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel+. FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDD Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.Results: The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO 2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO 2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO 2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38.27% compared to ASP I.Conclusion: With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other BASIC countries China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation. © 2011 Sheikh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The benefits provided by underutilised fruit tree species such as baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab has been identified as one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated for potential cultivation using species' locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm's databases and fieldwork for modelling site suitability for global cultivation of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method for studying cultivation potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab's global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country for baobab cultivation outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential for the cultivation of this species globally. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.

AB  - The natural regeneration of some desirable species under exploitation pressure in Amazon is often very poor or non-existent. The traditional techniques of enrichment planting have presented low performance of the planted seedlings and high costs for its implementation. This study analyzes the first 5 years of growth and survival of five tropical tree species (Bertholletia excelsa, Ceiba pentandra, Torresia acreana, Swietenia macrophylla and Cedrela fissilis) planted in skidding trails and exploitation gaps. The basic planting technique consisted in using the cleared areas after forest harvesting for the establishment of seedlings of species ecologically adapted to the gap environment. The study was carried out in the EMBRAPA-CPAF-ACRE (Agroforestry Research Centre of Acre) in Acre State in West Amazon. The diameter increment varied from 0.30 cm year-1 for Bertholletia to 0.52 cm year-1 for Swietenia and Torresia. After 5 years the height growth was similar for all species around 3.0 m. In the first year Bertholletia presented a high mortality, around 80%, caused by severe predation by rodents. Ceiba also presented a high mortality after the second year of planting probably due the canopy closure. The best survival percentage was presented by Torresia, over 90%. The Meliaceae (Swietenia and Cedrela) species had a similar survival, around 70 to 75%. The Hypsipyla grandella attack was more severe in Cedrela than in Swietenia, but in both cases (9.37 and 31% after 7 and 5 years respectively for Swietenia and Cedrela) was still low when compared with other enrichment plantings.

AB  - The results of a study to assess the initial impact of the introduction of contour hedgerow intercropping on the Indonesian islands of Lombok and Sumbawa are described. The study focused on the reasons for adopting this technique and its initial effect. The results of detailed case studies in four villages indicated that the process of adoption is heterogeneous. Land-use conditions in the four villages were much more diverse and dynamic than the project anticipated. Rather than being an 'off the shelf' technique as assumed by the project, hedgerow cropping proved to be a 'prototype' technique; the farmers' ability to adapt the practice to their specific farming conditions such as subsistence food production or cash crop cultivation was an important motive for its adoption. In some cases the introduction competed with the extension of other promising land-use practices. Several farmers adopted the technique not because of its productive benefits, but as a means to gain access to land or credit, or to demonstrate their allegiance to social networks. The results indicate that there were significant discontinuities between what the project intended to achieve by introducing the technique and the farmers' motives for adopting it. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The reclamation of brackish sediments for agriculture involves the danger that pyrite minerals present in the deposits will be oxidized and produce unfavorable conditions for plant growth. Pyrite minerals are oxidized when the swamp is reclaimed by forest cutting, canal excavation and destruction of the peat cover. In South Kalimantan, Banjarese people cultivate rice using a technique adapted to soils that originate from pyrite-containing sediments, especially where non-acidic water for flushing the toxic materials is available. However, the agricultural land in areas with pyrite-containing sediments is a fragile system. Even the productive rice plots are constantly threatened by the sudden collapse of the delicate balance. To understand the effect of the Banjarese rice cultural practice on soil conditions in areas with pyrite-containing sediments, land use and water management practices were observed in the field, and eight auger samples were taken for laboratory analyses. The results show that intensive leaching of the pyrite-containing sediments leads to the development of a specific soil chemical profile comprising an oxidized horizon, an acid-accumulating horizon, and a reduced horizon. This paper presents details of soil development processes and soil management problems.

AB  - Wildfires in tropical forest and savanna are a strong source of trace gas and particulate emissions to the atmosphere, but estimates of the continental-scale impacts are limited by large uncertainties in the rates of fire occurrence and biomass combustion. Satellite-based remote sensing offers promise for characterising fire physical properties and impacts on the environment, but currently available sensors saturate over high-radiance targets and provide only indications of regions and times at which fires are extensive and their areal rate of growth as recorded in ash layers. Here we describe an approach combining satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing with in situ measurements of smoke to estimate emissions from central Brazil. These estimates will improve global accounting of radiation-absorbing gases and particulates that may be contributing to climate change and will provide strategic data for fire management. -Authors

AB  - This paper describes four global-change phenomena that are having major impacts on Amazonian forests. The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr-1 in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr-1 from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr-1 from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia. The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large- scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mato Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin. The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 El Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges. Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.

AB  - Periodic burning of the vast Imperata grassland areas of Indonesia is thought to have a number of negative consequences, both on and off site. We assess on-site biophysical and economic consequences by adapting a bioeconomic model to conditions prevalent in the Indonesian uplands. Burning is shown to exacerbate soil degradation both directly through loss of soil nutrients and indirectly through erosion. Despite this, it is demonstrated that burning is the most profitable method of Imperata control in an upland 'shifting cultivation' system. Changing factor prices may alter this. A 25% reduction in herbicide prices would make herbicide use more attractive than burning. If off-site costs are considered, Imperata control with herbicide may be preferable to burning. Upland cropping within an Imperata fallow system is marginally profitable under prevailing economic and biophysical conditions. Abandonment of these upland areas by smallholders, or adoption of more productive farming systems, seems inevitable.

AB  - Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT, and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M. The O+V/M+C under NT, which probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg ha-1 more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha-1 more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg ha-1 per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of about 44 Mg ha-1 from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue additions to soil surface.

AB  - Regíonal climatic change, including significant reductions in Amazon Basin evaporation and precipitation, has been predicted by numerical simulations of total tropical forest removal. These results have been shown to be very sensitive to the prescription of the albedo shift associated with conversion from forest to a replacement land cover. Modelers have so far chosen to use an "impoverished grassland" scenario to represent the postforest land surface. This choice maximizes the shifts in land surface parameters, especially albedo (fraction of incident shortwave radiation reflected by the surface). Recent surveys show secondary vegetation to be the dominant land cover for some deforested areas of the Amazon. The characteristics of secondary vegetation as well as agricultural land covers other than pasture have received little attention from field scientists in the region. This paper presents the results of field measurements of radiation flux over various deforested surfaces on a small farm in the eastern Amazonian state of Para. The albedo of fields in active use was as high as 0.176, slightly less than the 0.180 recently determined for Amazonian pasture and substantially less than the 0.19 commonly used in GCM simulations of deforestation. For 10-yr-old secondary vegetation, albedo was 0.135, practically indistinguishable from the recently published mean primary forest albedo of 0.134. Measurements of surface temperature and net radiation show that, despite similarity in albedo, secondary vegetation differs from primary forest in energy and mass exchange. The elevation of midday surface temperature above air temperature was found to be greatest for actively and recently farmed land, declining with time since abandonment. Net radiation was correspondingly lower for fields in active or recent use. Using land cover analyses of the region surrounding the study area for 1984, 1988, and 1991, the pace of change in regional-mean albedo is estimated to have declined and appears to be leveling at a value less than 0.03 above that of the original forest cover.

AB  - This paper analyzes soil-related agronomic constraints in the Sitiung region of Indonesia that are directly related to low nutrient-holding capacity, macroporosity, and rainfall regime. This region receives 2500 to 3000 mm of rainfall per year, but nearly 50% of the rainfall is disposed of rapidly via internal drainage. Although rapid internal drainage reduces the risks of erosion, it leads to infertility, acidity, and Al toxicity. The physical structure of the soils is characterized by stable aggregates, with numerous macropores in the surface and a predominantly microporous subsoil matrix interspersed with a few larger macropores. Macropores account for about 29% of porosity in the surface and between 3 and 6% in the subsoil. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix containing macropores averages about 300 to 400 cm/day, whereas that of the microporous matrix is generally < 1 cm/day. The structure facilitates rapid infiltration and leaching of rainfall. However, little opportunity exists for nutrients moving downward with drainage water to accumulate in the subsoil. The main reason for this seems to be the low hydraulic conductivity and the preponderance of excessive wetness in the subsoil. Drying seems to be essential for movement of nutrients into the subsoil matrix. However, most of the agronomic crops are sensitive to Al toxicity and fail to grow roots deeper than 10 to 15 cm. Thus, they suffer from water stress, despite heavy and frequent rainfall, and fail to cause drying of the subsoil. Problems of acidity, Al toxicity, and infertility worsen progressively where agricultural production consists mainly of Al-sensitive crops. Although liming with calcium carbonate improves the soil chemical environment, downward movement of lime is very slow. Deep liming is effective in improving rooting depth, crop water availability, and drying of the subsoil, but the technology is cost- and labor-intensive. Native vegetation, on the other hand, is able to grow roots to considerable depths and causes significant drying of the subsoil, even without soil amendments. Thus, production systems in which locally adapted vegetation of economic value is the main focus seem to be more sustainable and conducive to improving soil conditions.
