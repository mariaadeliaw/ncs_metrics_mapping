Reclaiming Tropical Saline-Sodic Soils with Gypsum and Cow Manure,salinesodic soils are a major impediment for agricultural production in semiarid regions salinity and sodicity drastically reduce agricultural crop yields damage farm equipment jeopardize food security and render soils unusable for agriculture however many farmers in developing semiarid regions cannot afford expensive amendments to reclaim salinesodic soils furthermore existing research does not cover soil types eg luvisols and lixisols that are found in many semiarid regions of south america therefore we used percolation columns to evaluate the effect of inexpensive chemical and organic amendments gypsum and cow manure on the reclamation of salinesodic soils in the northeast of brazil soil samples from two layers 020 cm and 2040 cm in depth were collected and placed in percolation columns then we applied gypsum into the columns with and without cow manure the experiment followed a complete randomized design with three replications the chemical amendment treatments included a control and four combinations of gypsum and cow manure percolation columns were subjected to a constant flood layer of 55 mm we evaluated the effectiveness of sodic soil reclamation treatments via changes in soil hydraulic conductivity chemical composition cations and anions electrical conductivity of the saturated soilpaste extract ph and the exchangeable sodium percentage these results suggest that the combined use of gypsum and cow manure is better to reduce soil sodicity improve soil chemical properties and increase water infiltration than gypsum alone cow manure at 40 ton ha1 was better than at 80 ton ha1 to reduce the sodium adsorption ratio,1
"Growth, Biomass and Carbon Stocks in Forest Cover Planted in an Area of Bauxite Mining in Rehabilitation",forest cover in areas degraded by mining is an alternative way of mitigating co2 concentrations in the atmosphere by fixing c in tree biomass this study evaluated the growth and c stocks of forest cover in an area of bauxite mining with four sources of fertilizer height ht diameter at ground level dgl and diameter at breast height dbh were determined in anadenanthera peregrina ap clonal eucalyptus euc and a mixed plantation of 16 native forest species nat at 6 18 36 and 56 months of age trunkbark volume biomass and c stock were also determined for these forest covers at 56 months of age the fertilization treatments were a standard sf adopted by the company sf plus organic fertilizer of chemical fertilizer cf and ofcf euc displayed greater values of ht dgl and dbh under ofcf and of fertilization did not influence the ht and dbh of ap but dgl was higher under ofcf at 36 months compared to sf the ht values of nat were influenced by fertilization at 18 months with the lowest values under sf the fertilization influenced the dgl of nat at 36 and 56 months which did not occur with dbh the pioneer species had higher ht dgl and dgb compared to nonpioneer species regardless of the type of fertilization studied fertilization influenced the ht and dgl of pioneer species at 18 and 36 months of age and only the ht of nonpioneer species the estimates of euc biomass 255 mg ha1 and c stocks 120 mg ha1 under ofoc were four times greater than in ap and nat which showed no difference between themselves or the types of fertilization the growth and estimates of volume biomass and c stocks of the forest cover were comparable to those of unmined areas euc had the greatest growth biomass and c stocks,2
AGRONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF MELON PRODUCED IN THE BRAZILIAN SEMIARID REGION,this study evaluates the agronomic and environmental performance of yellow melons produced in an experimental area in rio grande do norte brazil using conventional methods and alternative systems of cultivation based on the rotation of melons with green manure crops two types of alternative management systems were evaluated spanning twelve treatments i tillage with the incorporation of the green manure biomass into the soil via the subsequent planting of melons into that residue and ii no tillage with the maintenance of the biomass on the soil surface with subsequent planting of melons agronomic performance was evaluated by statistical analysis of productivity while environmental performance was evaluated by analyzing the carbon footprint according to iso 14067 agronomic analysis showed that rotation of melons with maize and brachiaria resulted in a higher yield of melons for export assessment of the carbon footprint of this system in relation to the conventional system showed that the rotation system presented a lower carbon footprint a scenario analysis showed that the carbon footprint can be further reduced by 4254 if i production takes place in areas already cultivated for more than 20 years ii the amount of inorganic nitrogen applied is reduced by 50 and iii commercialization of melons begins in the united states this study shows the importance of rotating melons with green manure crops to increase production in the semiarid region and reduce the carbon footprint of this fruit,3
Soil carbon fluxes and balances of crop rotations under long-term no-till,background a field study with the same crop rotations was conducted to test the hypothesis that the soil carbon fluxes and balances could vary according to the crop species and also mitigate carbon dioxide co2 emission this study aimed to assess the co2emission from crop rotations according to c and n inputs from crop residue the influences on soil organic carbon soc and total soil nitrogen tn stocks identifying the soybean production systems with positive c balance triticale x triticosecale or sunflower helianthus annuus are grown in the fallwinter sunn hemp crotalaria juncea forage sorghum sorghum bicolor pearl millet pennisetum glaucum or fallow are the spring treatments and soybean as a main crop in summer results we found that high c inputs from crop residues modify the c dynamics in crop rotations by reducing the c output co2 and increasing c sequestration in the soil in general the higher soc c stocks and tn in soil surface were due to higher c and n inputs from sunn hemp or forage sorghum crop residues in spring these crops also produced lower accumulated co2emissions and when rotating with triticale in the fallwinter season resulted in a positive c balance making these soybean crop rotations more efficient conclusion our study suggests the ideal crop species choice in a rotation can mitigate the co2emissions by increasing c and n input from crop residues and consequently soc and c stocks in particular crop rotation comprises an important tool to achieve a positive c balance mitigate co2emissions and provide an additional ecosystem service to soybean cultivation option,4
Agroforestry system improves soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in depth after land-use changes in the Brazilian semi-arid region,agroforestry systems have the potential to increase soil organic matter with effects on soil carbon and nitrogen contents but information on the application of these systems in semiarid regions is still scarce this study aimed to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in the conversion of native forest from the caatinga biome into integrated agriculture systems in the brazilian semiarid region we evaluated the following management systems in the haplic inceptisol cambissolo haplico eutrofico 1 intercropping area cultivated with corn and massai grass 2 caatinga natural vegetation 3 afs10 agroforestry system with native woody forest rows occupying 33 and agriculture occupying 66 of the total area and 4 afs20 agroforestry system presenting inverse proportions of afs10 the agroforestry systems were intercropped with sorghum or millet pigeon pea and massai grass we collected disturbed and undisturbed soil samples at the layers of 000010 010020 020040 040060 and 060100 m for analysis of carbon soc nitrogen n soil bulk density and calculation of soc and n stocks and cn ratio two years after the conversion of natural vegetation to the agricultural area intercropping and agroforestry system afs10 and afs20 we applied principal component and cluster analysis to explore the data and confidence interval to compare the means of accumulated soc and n stocks up to 1 m soil depth no differences exist for the properties analysed in superficial layers 000010 and 010020 m regardless of landuse systems afs20 increase the soc content and consequently soc stock in subsurface layers on the other hand intercropping increases n content and n stock afs20 presented higher accumulated soc stocks up to 100 m 11497 mg ha1 agroforestry systems management is an alternative for increasing carbon sequestration under the conversion from caatinga to agricultural areas,5
"Impact of cropping methods on biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in Sumatra, Indonesia",the sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change appropriate baseline data are rarely available as part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity plant species richness along a subjectively determined landuse intensity gradient in southern sumatra ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffeefarming systems simple complex with and without shade crops and smallholder coffee plantings at increasing levels of intensity we used 24 40 5 m plots to record site physical data including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure all vascular plant species and plant functional types pfts readily observable adaptive morphological features biodiversity was lowest under simple intensive nonshaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closedcanopy forests the most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were pft richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity vegetation structure tree dry weight and duration of the landuse type to a lesser degree were also highly correlated with biodiversity together with a vegetation or v index the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems these findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability copyright 2004 by the authors,6
Disentangling how management affects biomass stock and productivity of tropical secondary forests fallows,a better understanding of biomass production in secondary forests after cultivation is essential for assessing the resilience of slash and burn systems and their capacity to deliver ecosystem services biomass production is influenced by management legacies landscape configuration and soil but these drivers are rarely studied simultaneously nor is the role of changes in vegetation properties in linking them to biomass production we assessed how management legacies affect biomass in secondary forests created by slash and burn in the central congo basin and tested whether changes in productivity could be attributed to changes in stem density functional diversity functional identity or soil using data from 6452 trees in 96 fallow plots nested in 3 study sites we looked for the main determinants of aboveground biomass agb of woody vegetation in fallow systems next using a subset of 58 plots in fallow fields aged 5 to 10 years we used confirmatory path analysis to explore the relations between management history soil vegetation properties and biomass productivity the sampled fallow fields had on average 584 462 mg ha1 agb agb was positively related to both fallow age and to the proportion of remnant trees in agb and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles biomass productivity varied with the number of previous slashandburn cycles with notable declines in the fourth cycle the effect of management history was mainly through a reduction in the dominance of fast growing tree species and in the number of regenerating stems which were also indirectly affected by an increase in c odorata cover soil fertility status and the biomass of remnant trees also modified biomass productivity our findings suggest that under the current management intensity the capacity of the slash and burn system to provide important ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration is declining c 2018 elsevier bv all rights reserved,7
A new in-field indicator to assess the impact of land management on soil carbon dynamics,the assessment of the impacts of landuse and management on soil organic carbon soc dynamics is a major environmental concern as the soil carbon cycle underpins key ecosystem services however assessments based on shortterm soc dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties hurisso et al 2016 proposed a method to assess soc dynamics by coupling two methods permanganate oxidizable carbon poxc and basal soil respiration bsr this method has been used in laboratory on dried and rewetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly in our study we adapted this method to the field and proposed a costeffective infield indicator combining the poxc and in situ basal soil respiration situresp r methodwe tested the indicator at four study sites n 169 points within various tropical landuse and management contexts based on rubber soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in thailand cambodia and indonesia the results demonstrated the relevance sensitivity and robustness of the poxcsituresp r indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on soc dynamics the results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture notillage and crops residues and compost amendments to accumulate soc rockeval r analysis showed that poxcsituresp r indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon carbon pools targeted by the poxc were specified by rockeval r pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of socour study confirms that the integrated indicator based on poxc and bsr assess a relative carbon stabilization of soc pools this indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and costeffective method,8
"Greenhouse gas emissions from sugar cane ethanol: Estimate considering current different production scenarios in Minas Gerais, Brazil",the studies of greenhouse gas ghg emissions of sugarcane ethanol production show few scenarios or in most cases a single representative scenario of the most common practices for ethanol production however the combination of the diverse sugarcane agricultural and industrialization practices lead to a wide variety of production scenarios current studies do not show the ghg emissions balance for all these scenarios this issue is the aim of this study which presents a ghg emissions balance of ethanol production considering 120 different scenarios related to current sugarcane agricultural and industrial practices in brazil with data of minas gerais in order to obtain the ethanol production scenarios different types of cultivation fertilization harvesting and different sugarcane crop cycles were combined the scenarios were classified by groups according to their ghg emission levels the main characteristics of each group were analyzed in order to identify the factors that influence the performance of ghg emissions the results show ghg emission levels ranging from 248938 kg co2eqha1yr1 to 328995 kg co2eqha1yr1 depending on the regime of agricultural practices present in each scenario the factors that most favor the increase of ghg emission levels are short sugarcane crop cycle combined with fertigation with stillage these two factors were present in production scenarios that presented the highest levels of ghg emissions in this study the factors that most favor the decrease of ghg emissions are long sugarcane crop cycle fertilization without stillage on ratoon and mechanical harvesting without sugarcane burning all these factors were present in scenarios that presented the lowest ghg emissions on the other hand in certain agricultural conditions the mechanical harvesting of green cane showed to be as polluting as manual harvesting of burnt cane the differences between the types of cultivation showed no significant influence on the final balance of ghg emissions,9
A simplified modelling approach for quantifying tillage effects on soil carbon stocks,soil tillage has been shown to affect longterm changes in soil organic carbon soc content in a number of field experiments this paper presents a simplified approach for including effects of tillage in models of soil c turnover in the tilledsoil layer we used an existing soil organic matter som model cnsim with standard soc data for a homogeneous tilled layer from four longterm field experiments with conventionally tilled ct and notill nt treatments the som model was tested on data from longterm 10 years field trials differing in climatic conditions soil properties residue management and crop rotations in australia brazil the usa and switzerland the c input for the treatments was estimated using data on crop rotation and residue management the som model was applied for both ct and nt trials without recalibration but incorporated a tillage factor tf to scale all decomposition and maintenance parameters in the model an initial value of tf 057 parameter uncertainty pu 015 for nt with tf set to 10 for ct was used on the basis of a previous study with observations of soil co2 respiration the simulated and observed changes in soc were then compared using slopes of linear regressions of soc changes over time results showed that the som model captured observed changes in soc content from differences in rotations n application and crop residue management for conventional tillage on the basis of soc change data a mean tf of 048 standard deviation sd 012 was estimated for nt the results indicate that i the estimated uncertainty of tillage effects on soc turnover may be smaller than previously thought and ii simple scaling of som model parameters may be sufficient to capture the effects of soil tillage on som turnover in the tilled layer scenario analyses showed that the average extra c input needed to compensate for soil tillage was 762 sd 351 kg c ha1 year1 climatic conditions temperature and precipitation also affected how much extra c was needed with substantially larger inputs being required for wetter and warmer climates,10
Diversified crop rotations increase the yield and economic efficiency of grain production systems,crop rotations with high plant diversity and biomass input have been recognized worldwide as a crucial practice for increasing the sustainability of grain production systems particularly in regions under notillage nt management nonetheless lowdiversity grain production systems based on double cropping two crops in the same agricultural year repeated over time including soybean followed by maize known in brazil as second crop maize or wheat remain prevalent in brazil the continuous use of these systems can impair soil yield capacity farmers profits and environmental sustainability therefore this study aimed to verify the grain yield and profitability of different production systems with different levels of plant diversity this study was based on results obtained during the 20092017 cropping seasons through a longterm field trial conducted under nt since 1985 in southern brazil the trial covered two 4year agricultural cycles with two crops per year resulting in eight crops per cycle and 16 crops over the entire period the experiment followed a randomized complete block design with five treatments and four replicates the treatments involved three diversified crop rotations comprising different cover crops and two doublecrop systems wheatsoybean and maizesoybean for a given agricultural year wheat and cover crops white oats black oats and forage radish were grown from may to september and the second crop maize was grown from march to august soybean and first crop maize were grown during the summer from october to february the grain yield gross revenue production cost and cumulative profit were analyzed for each production system gross revenue and profit were primarily estimated based on the actual annual average commodity prices received by farmers and two additional price scenarios pessimistic and optimistic were proposed considering the average prices from 2010 to 2017 regardless of the cropping season first crop maize and wheat grain yields were higher in diversified crop rotations the production system only affected the second crop maize yield in 20102011 with a higher value obtained in a diversified crop rotation system the soybean yield in diversified crop rotations was higher than that in double crop systems considering each cash crop separately soybean produced the highest average profit us 47250 ha1 followed by the first crop maize us 24531 ha1 and wheat us 7771 ha1 whereas the second crop maize led to economic losses us 12173 ha1 all diversified crop rotations produced a higher 8year cumulative profit and gross margin than the maizesoybean in doublecrop system the relative economic performance of production systems remained unchanged under alternative price scenarios pessimistic and optimistic compared with that under the observed actual price scenario however the cumulative profit of maize and soybean in doublecrop system was the most negatively impacted in the pessimistic scenario 459 indicating greater economic risk overall lack of direct revenues from cover crops were compensated by increased grain yield in the springsummer season and profitability of diversified crop rotation systems therefore diversified crop rotation systems are economically competitive with double crop systems rendering them feasible management options for conserving natural resources and increasing crop resilience to adverse climatic conditions,11

Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions,extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet naturebased sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1 yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires costeffective methods2 tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3 here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest from 2000 to 2016 and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m we estimate that an area of 215 million hectaresan area greater than the entire country of mexicohas potential for natural forest regeneration representing an aboveground carbon sequestration potential of 234 gt c range 211257 gt over 30 years five countries brazil indonesia china mexico and colombia account for 52 of this estimated potential showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential our results facilitate broader equitable decisionmaking processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas,16
A country-scale analysis revealed effective land-use zoning affecting forest cover changes in Myanmar,the permanent forest estate pfe is a tool for maintaining forest areas in perpetuity the pfe can have several different landuse zones based on different purposes here we evaluated the effectiveness of the pfe in reducing deforestation using countryscale datasets of forest cover change between 2006 and 2017 in myanmar we also evaluated the effectiveness of pfe landuse zones such as protected areas pas and production forests in reducing deforestation the effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching to minimize the effect of the nonrandom distribution of the pfe and specific landuse zoning the results showed that the pfe significantly reduced deforestation compared to nonpfe areas within the pfe both pas and production forests had lower deforestation than nonpfe however both the pfe and nonpfe showed an increased trend of annual deforestation between 2006 and 2017 production forests also showed an increased trend of annual deforestation although pas did not we concluded that the pfe pas and production forests are effective in reducing deforestation however in myanmar further efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the increase of deforestation in the pfe especially in production forests,17
Differential seedling establishment of woody plants along a tree density gradient in Neotropical savannas,seedling dynamics are crucial for understanding spatial plant distribution patterns yet little is known about seedling establishment in neotropical savannas because empirical studies at the community level are scarce over 2 years we studied the recruitment and survival of an initial seedling assemblage and three cohorts of recruits of woody plants within 216 plots of 1 m 2 located along a tree density gradient in the savannas of central brazil these savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover from closed high canopy cover to open savannas low canopy cover and are located along shallow topographic gradients we measured communitywide seedling limitation ie proportion of 1m 2 plots without seedlings of any woody species photosynthetic photon flux density litter cover soil moisture and soil nutrients in each savanna type because closed savannas had lower ppfd and higher leaf litter cover than open savannas we evaluated the effects of light level and litter cover on seedling emergence of nine dominant savanna woody species under controlled conditions in a glasshouse density recruitment and survival of seedlings decreased over time because of mortality in all savanna types but they were consistently higher in closed than in open savannas communitywide seedling limitation was significantly lower in closed 016 003 than in open 030 005 savannas in the glasshouse high litter cover and very low light levels reduced seedling emergence of most species suggesting an adaptation to delay seed germination until the wet season when soil water availability is high and leaf litter rapidly decomposes synthesis in neotropical savannas tree canopy cover facilitates seedling establishment of woody species by reducing stressful environmental conditions in particular low irradiance and high litter cover in closed savannas enhance the recruitment and survival of woody seedlings relative to open savannas by reducing soil water deficits and increasing nutrient availability in the upper soil layers the higher seedling limitation of tree species in open than in closed savannas contributes to maintain relatively different balances between trees and herbaceous plants along topographic gradients in neotropical savannas and helps to explain spatial distribution patterns of woody species in these ecosystems 2012 the authors journal of ecology 2012 british ecological society,18
"Fodder grass productivity and soil fertility changes under four grass plus tree associations in Kerala, India",adapted treegrass combinations make a valuable contribution to forage production in the indian peninsula but knowledge of the interactive effects between trees and grasses on their production is limited we therefore conducted a field experiment involving combinations of four trees and grasses besides monospecific grass controls for seven years to investigate grass productivity in association with leguminous and non leguminous multipurpose trees mpt having disparate canopy architecture and to assess the endofrotation soil fertility changes post rotation changes in herbage productivity were evaluated by growing teosinte zea mexicana for three years the four mpts were acacia auriculiformis ailanthus triphysa casuarina equisetifolia and leucaena leucocephala grasses included pennisetum purpureum hybrid napier brachiaria ruziziensis congo signal panicum maximum guinea grass and teosinte lower tree branches were pruned from fifth year understorey herbage production increased until three years in all treegrass combinations but declined subsequently as tree crowns expanded overall casuarina among mpts and hybrid napier and guinea grass among forage crops were more productive than others pruning mpts generally favoured greater herbage production understorey light levels for acacia ailanthus casuarina and leucaena were 17 60 55 and 55 of that in the open at five years during the postrotation phase mpt plots were characterised by higher soil nutrient capital and consequently teosinte yields were higher than in the treeless control treatment all previous treegrass combinations showed an increasing trend till two years after mpt felling yield levels declined subsequently despite at variable rates careful selection of the tree and grass components is therefore crucial for optimising herbage productivity in silvopastoral systems,19
"Pasture recovery, emissions, and the Brazilian Paris agreement commitments",this paper evaluates the socioeconomic land use change and greenhouse gases emissions impacts of degraded pastures recovery dpr in brazil assessing the contribution to the brazilian paris agreement commitments we used a computable general equilibrium model termbr15 in a scenario simulation for the period 20152035 the simulation includes dpr shocks of productivity investments and soil organic carbon soc fixation we used two carbon accounting methods for the impacts on emissions the original method of brazils emissions inventory which does not consider soc and the alternative method which includes soc fixation results show a 056 growth in gross domestic product and 073 in real household consumption relative to the 2035 baseline there would be a social return of r805 billion in 2023 prices representing r827 for every real invested less developed and more dependent on cattle ranching regions would benefit the most cattle ranching would expand production using less area resulting in a landsaving effect of 115 million hectares in 2035 ghg emissions would increase by 783 in the original accounting method resulting from herd and economic growth in the alternative method 023 mitigation would occur showing that soc fixation can more than offset the economic activity growth independently of the ghg accounting method brazil would achieve the 2025 mitigation target of 37 relative to 2005 but would not meet the 50 mitigation target of 2030 soc fixation could contribute up to 57 of the 2030 mitigation target our results show that dpr is a sustainable production system that increases economic growth avoids deforestation and could mitigate ghg emissions we provide information on regional impacts suitable for better decisionmaking for pasture restoration incentives in brazil 2024 elsevier ltd,20
Forest restoration rehabilitates soil multifunctionality in riparian zones of sugarcane production landscapes,brazilian sugarcane plays a vital role in the production of both sugar and renewable energy however land use change and longterm conventional sugarcane cultivation have degraded entire watersheds including a substantial loss of soil multifunctionality in our study riparian zones have been reforested to mitigate these impacts protect aquatic ecosystems and restore ecological corridors within the sugarcane production landscapes we examined i how forest restoration enables rehabilitation of the soils multifunctionality after longterm sugarcane cultivation and ii how long it takes to regain ecosystem functions comparable to those of a primary forest we investigated a time series of riparian forests at 6 15 and 30 years after starting restoration by planting trees named active restoration and determined soil c stocks delta13c indicative of c origin as well as measures indicative of soil health a primary forest and a longterm sugarcane field were used as references eleven soil physical chemical and biological indicators were used for a structured soil health assessment calculating index scores based on soil functions foresttocane conversion reduced 306 mg ha1 of soil c stocks causing soil compaction and loss of cation exchange capacity thus degrading soils physical chemical and biological functions forest restoration for 630 years recovered 1620 mg c ha1 stored in soils in all restored sites soil functions such as supporting root growth aerating the soil nutrient storage capacity and providing c energy for microbial activity were gradually recovered thirty years of active restoration was sufficient to reach the primary forest state in overall soil health index multifunctional performance and c sequestration we conclude that active forest restoration in sugarcanedominated landscapes is an effective way to restore soil multifunctionality approaching the level of the native forest in approximately three decades moreover the c sequestration in the restored forest soils will help to mediate global warming,21
Soil processes and properties related to the genesis and evolution of a Pleistocene savanna palm swamp (vereda) in central Brazil,the peat properties of brazilian palm swamps or veredas as they are locally known lend these environments the character of water reservoirs and carbon stores in addition to being important archives of past changes in this paper we present in highresolution the stratigraphy and morphological physical chemical elemental and isotopic properties of a deep soil vereda core pau grande with 283 cm from the grande serta tilde o veredas national park in the state of minas gerais brazil the core is constituted by 10 histic horizons in the first 151 cm and one mineral layer from 151 to 283 cm peat sedimentation rates were different along its depth as follow 00273 cm year1 109111 cm 00018 cm year 1 8587 cm 00027 cm year1 5961 cm 00031 cm year1 4547 cm and 00042 cm year1 2426 cm mean values of the main peat properties were 16 for c 44 for si1720o for delta c13 368o for delta n15 167 for gravimetric moisture 75 for mineral material 8 for rubbed fibres 358 for ph 077 mg m3 for bulk density and 015 for bulk density of the organic matter principal components analysis was applied to peat properties to assist in the identification of processesdrivers that control the nature of the studied vereda in addition to providing evidence of changes in the paleoenvironment the first principal component pc1 is related to the relative accumulation of organic versus local mineral matter linked to the evolution of the catchment soils erosion and possible associated vegetation c3 and c4 plants pc2 is related to the hydromorphism conditions pc3 is related to the incorporation of inorganic material through the deposition of dust from regional sources and pc4 is related to the main sources of organic matter radiocarbon dating indicates this vereda began its formation during the late pleistocene five phases of changes in the environment were also verified i 3330926818 cal bp formation of a lake or a shallow water body predominance of algae and locally and regionally unstable environment ii 2681816659 cal bp predominance of terrestrial plants locally stable but regionally unstable environment iii 1665910401 cal bp oxic drier environment with a predominance of c4 terrestrial plants and a simultaneous increase in local instability with stabilization of the regional environment at similar to 150 kyr cal bp iv 104015052 cal bp return to being an algal source in even more oxic conditions and beginning of greater stability in both the local and regional environments and v 5052 cal bp until present consolidation of the stable environment initiated in the previous phase characteristic reducing environment to that currently found in the pau grande vereda and changing the contribution of organic matter sources initially with terrestrial plants and subsequently algae our results suggest that the pau grande vereda is a complex ecosystem these environments have a large potential for studies on environmental reconstruction and climate changes that have occurred since the late pleistocene and they should be fully protected,22
Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?,recycling empty fruit bunches efbs in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 310 of the plot the impact of this practice on soil quality including soil biodiversity is not well known at the plot scale we analysed soil physical chemical and biological variables five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers each zone was analysed separately our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones particularly in available p and k mg and ph similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with efb deposition over time the amacher index adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good the average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems but reference data from indonesia are lacking application of efbs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm however these data did not show that recycling efb stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale c 2016 elsevier masson sas all rights reserved,23
Influence of trees on soil nutrient pools in a silvopastoral system in the Brazilian Savannah,silvopastoral systems sps have been suggested as an approach to reduce pasture degradation and consequently reduce the deforestation of new areas in the brazilian cerrado savanna this study assessed the contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in lagoa santa minas gerais state brazil 19 35 36 s 43 51 56 w altitude 747 m the sps has developed since 1984 through the use of natural regeneration of the native species zeyheria tuberculosa vell bur with a density of 160 trees ha1 the forage component of the system was brachiaria brizantha cv marandu the control treatment was a pasture adjacent to sps with the same forage but without the influence of trees in 2005 the litterfall of trees leaves fruits and stems was collected monthly and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured soil profile samples were collected in february 2006 the litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen n potassium k and calcium ca2 in the soil organic matter om and k reduced with depth at this planting density this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity in the 02 cm layer andor in the profile as a whole in contrast there were no significant differences in n p and k content of the control and sps soil this can be related to the high cn and ligninn ratios of the litter inputs agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components tree forage and animal must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of sps by land managers are unlikely springer sciencebusiness media bv 2009,24
Mapping the spatial distribution of pyrite and evaluating soil and water properties in idle swamp land: A strategy to promote sustainable paddy field establishment and prevent land degradation,the idle swamp land of the former mega rice project in indonesia has the potential for development of paddy field as a response to the global food crisis mapping of pyrite fes 2 in swamp land as the key driver of soil degradation and poor water quality has not been made to establish a strategy for sustainable paddy field practices the objective of the study was to assess the spatial distribution of pyrite fes 2 through detailed mapping and to evaluate soil and water properties associated with the adverse effects of pyrite detailed conventional pyrite mapping with a grid system at 110000 scale covering a large area of 26588 ha had been made a comprehensive analysis of soil chemical physical and mineralogical properties pyrite content and water properties was conducted the detailed pyrite mapping showed that spatial distribution of pyrite was delineated into six depth classes in the order of decreasing extent p3 moderately deep 50 75 cm p4 deep 75 100 cm p5 very deep 100 150 cm p2 shallow 25 50 cm p6 exceptionally deep 150 cm p1 very shallow 0 25 cm these pyrite classes allow zonation management strategy of soils and water table into different depths to avoid pyrite oxidation and its harmful effect soils have limited easily weathered minerals 16 implying low inherited soil nutrients in the topsoils chemical properties exhibited extreme acidity ph 38 42 imbalanced cations with excess mg low in k and p and zn cu and mn micronutrients the dynamic changes of water properties in network canals showed a drop in ph from 60 at the inlet and primary canal to 29 and 35 in the canal network secondary tertiary quaternary pyrite collector as well as the increased al and so 4 ions suggests the decrease in quality throughout the canal network we propose the management strategy for the sustainable establishment of paddy field in pyritic swamp areas including i performing detailed mapping of pyrite classes to guide depth based pyrite zonation to control water table ii implementing controlled drainage water flow from inlet to various canal networks corresponds to pyrite depth zonation iii applying lime with ca rich materials but not dolomite containing mg to improve cation balance reduce acidity increase soil ph and suppress ion toxicity iv utilizing adaptivetolerant rice cultivars to acidity and v application of npk fertilizer to alleviate nutrient deficiencies these strategies can be implemented to ensure the sustainability of paddy fields and avoid soil degradation in swamp land,25
Habitat structure and food resources for wildlife across successional stages in a tropical forest,tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of oldgrowth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas the impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated recent reviews and multitaxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern sometimes stronger than changes in diversity with a replacement from habitat generalists to oldgrowth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration however the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests and to support and guide management techniques for restoration by sampling 28 sites in a continuous atlantic forest area in southeastern brazil we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery oldgrowth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level deeper leaf litter and higher woody debris volume and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm whereas vegetation connectivity grounddwelling arthropod biomass and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages from these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resourcerich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages while species with higher competitive ability in resourcelimited environments or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits on higher complexity at the ground level or on open space for flying should dominate oldergrowth forests since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses we also found structural and functional differences between oldgrowth forests and secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems such as the brazilian atlantic forest c 2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved,26

"The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna",plantation forests and secondgrowth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics we sampled the leaflitter herpetofauna of primary secondary and eucalyptus plantation forests in the jari river area of northeastern brazilian amazonia we used four complementary sampling techniques combined samples from 2 consecutive years and collected 1739 leaflitter amphibians 23 species and 1937 lizards 30 species we analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity speciesabundance distributions and community structure primary rainforest harbored significantly more species but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of secondgrowth forest or plantations plantation forests were dominated by wideranging habitat generalists secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat amphibian communities in secondary forests and eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct and was dominated by openarea species although plantation forests are relatively impoverished naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna nevertheless secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation 2007 society for conservation biology,28
Very high resolution canopy height maps from RGB imagery using self-supervised vision transformer and convolutional decoder trained on aerial lidar,vegetation structure mapping is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and monitoring naturebased approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation repeated measurements of these data allow for the observation of deforestation or degradation of existing forests natural forest regeneration and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices like agroforestry assessments of tree canopy height and crown projected area at a high spatial resolution are also important for monitoring carbon fluxes and assessing treebased land uses since forest structures can be highly spatially heterogeneous especially in agroforestry systems very high resolution satellite imagery less than one meter 1 m ground sample distance makes it possible to extract information at the tree level while allowing monitoring at a very large scale this paper presents the first highresolution canopy height map concurrently produced for multiple subnational jurisdictions specifically we produce very high resolution canopy height maps for the states of california and sao paulo a significant improvement in resolution over the ten meter 10 m resolution of previous sentinel gedi based worldwide maps of canopy height the maps are generated by the extraction of features from a selfsupervised model trained on maxar imagery from 2017 to 2020 and the training of a dense prediction decoder against aerial lidar maps we also introduce a post processing step using a convolutional network trained on gedi observations we evaluate the proposed maps with setaside validation lidar data as well as by comparing with other remotely sensed maps and fieldcollected data and find our model produces an average mean absolute error mae of 28 m and mean error me of 06 m,29
Regrowing forests contribution to law compliance and carbon storage in private properties of the Brazilian Amazon,the viability of the climate pledges made by brazil at the cop21 in paris 2015 heavily depends on the success of the country policies related to forest governance particularly there are high expectations that the enforcement of the brazilian forest code bfc will drive largescale forest recovery and carbon mitigation in this study we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the bfc considering different law implementation settings focusing on the amazon biome we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry 250000 properties onto land cover maps to quantify onsite forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery similarly we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for offsite deficit compensation ie via marketbased forest certificates trade regrowing forests could reduce onsite 32 mha of forests deficits decreasing noncompliance from private properties by 35 likewise forest certificates availability increased by 34 mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations this means an increase in the forest certificate offerdemand ratio from 09 to 20 on the one hand trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a lowcost strategy for compliance with the bfc a pathway for achieving restoration targets and an additional source of income for landholders to meet this potential it is necessary to better conceptualize secondgrowth forests advancing the poor definitions presented by the bfc and offer an operational basis for their protection on the other hand including regrowing forests certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected oldgrowth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions we highlight that the bfc implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement 2019 the authors,30

Fate of methane in canals draining tropical peatlands,tropical wetlands and freshwaters are major contributors to the growing atmospheric methane ch4 burden extensive peatland drainage has lowered ch4emissions from peat soils in southeast asia but the canals draining these peatlands may be hotspots of ch4 emissions alternatively ch4 oxidation consumption by methanotrophic microorganisms may attenuate emissions here we used laboratory experiments and a synoptic survey of the isotopic composition of ch4 in 34 canals across west kalimantan indonesia to quantify the proportion of ch4 that is consumed and therefore not emitted to the atmosphere we find that ch4 oxidation mitigates 764 120 of potential canal emissions reducing emissions by similar to 70 mg ch4 m2 d1 methane consumption also significantly impacts the stable isotopic fingerprint of canal ch4 emissions as canals drain over 65 of peatlands in southeast asia our results suggest that ch4 oxidation significantly influences landscapescale ch4 emissions from these ecosystems,32
Bat phylogenetic responses to regenerating Amazonian forests,1 throughout the tropics regenerating secondary forests occupy vast areas previously cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching however despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forestassociated biodiversity longitudinal studies on species phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare2 we surveyed bats in continuous primary forest primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a wholeecosystem amazonian fragmentation experiment similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic alpha and betadiversity3we found that temporal changes in phylogenetic alpharichness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time however when the effects of species richness were accounted for the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types temporal differences in phylogenetic betadiversity were driven mainly by betareplacement in secondary forest and continuous forest similar to 30 years after forest clearance both habitats also clustered together in terms of betarichness indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage consequently regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time4 synthesis and applications approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration while ensuring the longterm protection of secondary forests regardless of their age is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover and in the surroundings of protected areas,33
Co-Creating Strategies to Optimize Traditional Silvopastoral Systems through the Management of Native Trees in Caivas in Southern Brazil,the conservation of forest remnants in southern brazil is closely related to historical land use for example in systems such as ca iacutevas that occur within remnants of the araucaria forest and include livestock production and the extraction of yerba mate over the last decade technologies adapted for these systems have been developed that promote a significant increase in animal productivity without harming forest regeneration or the maintenance of the tree layer however the fertilization of pastures proposed in the technology has also promoted greater growth of native trees with a consequent increase in shade levels this in turn has affected the maintenance of pasture and yerba mate in the understory thus this study sought to develop a methodology to adjust shade levels based on forest management that adheres to the limits permitted by current legislation the objective was to evaluate the effect of tree management to maintain 50 shade levels on environmental indicators in a ca iacuteva that has been implementing pasture improvement technology since 2013 native tree management occurred in 2020 and 2022 and the results were compared with data from the floristic survey of the area carried out in 2013 the results indicate that although the adoption of forest management to adjust shade levels reduced the density of individuals it did not affect forest diversity nor the basal area of the ca iacuteva tree layer as such it is possible to maintain pasture and yerba mate production in the area strategies like this are fundamental so that the forest landscape can continue to offer a source of production while also supporting environmental conservation,34
"Forest fragments, primary and secondary forests harbour similar arthropod assemblages after 40 years of landscape regeneration in the Central Amazon",largescale deforestation leads to habitat loss and fragmentation with major consequences for biodiversity however the impacts of these environmental disturbances can be mitigated by forest regeneration we evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and vegetation recovery on arthropod assemblages in humanmodified landscapes in the amazon arthropods were sampled in 10ha forest fragments continuous primary forests and secondary forests using malaise traps we identified arthropods in multiple taxonomic resolutions from order to species we collected 25230 arthropods belonging to 17 orders coleoptera and hemiptera were more abundant in secondary forests compared to other habitats a dipteran family clusiidae and a horse fly species dichelacera cervicornistabanidae were identified as indicators of forest fragments and continuous forests respectively similar levels of taxonomic diversity between habitats were documented the taxonomic composition also was similar between studied habitats in all taxonomic resolutions although the studied landscapes suffered strong environmental disturbances four decades ago the vegetation has been in continuous regeneration since then favouring the dispersal of arthropods throughout habitats forest fragments and old secondary forests contribute to the maintenance of a rich and diverse arthropod assemblage in landscapes composed of large tracts of continuous primary forests,35

Tropical Peatland Hydrology Simulated With a Global Land Surface Model,tropical peatlands are among the most carbondense ecosystems on earth and their water storage dynamics strongly control these carbon stocks the hydrological functioning of tropical peatlands differs from that of northern peatlands which has not yet been accounted for in global land surface models lsms here we integrated tropical peatspecific hydrology modules into a global lsm for the first time by utilizing the peatlandspecific model structure adaptation peatclsm of the nasa catchment land surface model clsm we developed literaturebased parameter sets for natural peatclsmtropnat and drained peatclsmtropdrain tropical peatlands simulations with peatclsmtropnat were compared against those with the default clsm version and the northern version of peatclsm peatclsmnorthnat with tropical vegetation input all simulations were forced with global meteorological reanalysis input data for the major tropical peatland regions in central and south america the congo basin and southeast asia the evaluation against a unique and extensive data set of in situ water level and eddy covariancederived evapotranspiration showed an overall improvement in bias and correlation compared to the default clsm version over southeast asia an additional simulation with peatclsmtropdrain was run to address the large fraction of drained tropical peatlands in this region peatclsmtropdrain outperformed clsm peatclsmnorthnat and peatclsmtropnat over drained sites despite the overall improvements of peatclsmtropnat over clsm there are strong differences in performance between the three study regions we attribute these performance differences to regional differences in accuracy of meteorological forcing data and differences in peatland hydrologic response that are not yet captured by our model 2022 the authors journal of advances in modeling earth systems published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of american geophysical union,48
A process-based model for quantifying the effects of canal blocking on water table and CO2 emissions in tropical peatlands,drainage in tropical peatlands increases co2 emissions the rate of subsidence and the risk of forest fires to a certain extent these effects can be mitigated by raising the water table depth wtd using canal or ditch blocks the performance of canal blocks in raising wtd is however poorly understood because the wtd monitoring data are limited and spatially concentrated around canals and canal blocks this raises the following question how effective are canal blocks in raising the wtd over large areas in this work we composed a processbased hydrological model to assess the peatland restoration performance of 168 canal blocks in a 22000ha peatland area in sumatra indonesia we simulated daily wtd over 1 year using an existing canal block setup and compared it to the situation without blocks the study was performed across two contrasting weather scenarios representing dry 1997 and wet 2013 years our simulations revealed that while canal blocks had a net positive impact on wtd rise they lowered wtd in some areas and the extent of their effect over 1 year was limited to a distance of about 600m around the canals we also show that canal blocks are most effective in peatlands with high hydraulic conductivity averaging over all modeled scenarios blocks raised the annual mean wtd by only 15cm this value was similar in the dry 144cm and wet 157cm years and there was a 213 fold difference between the scenarios with large and small hydraulic conductivities 205cm versus 096cm using a linear relationship between wtd and co2 emissions we estimated that averaging over peat hydraulic properties canal blocks prevented the emission of 107mgha1 co2 in the dry year and 117mgha1 co2 in the wet year we believe that the modeling tools developed in this work could be adopted by local stakeholders aiming at a more effective and evidencebased approach to canalblockbased peatland restoration 2023 iaki urzainki et al,49
"C-Band Dual-Polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar Application for Peat Depth Classification: A Case Study in Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia",knowledge of peat depth distribution is vitally important for accurately estimating carbon stock within tropical peatlands these estimates aid in understanding the role of tropical peatlands in global environmental change processes this study evaluates the potential of cband dualpolarization synthetic aperture radar sar data for peat depth classification on oil palm plantations in siak regency riau province indonesia specifically features derived after the groundrange radar cross section sigmanaught or sigma0 and slantrange perpendicular radar cross section gammanaught or gamma0 for both polarization channels of cband sentinel1 data were compared and evaluated on monthly basis during 2015 for discriminating peat depth classes using the decision tree classifier overall gamma0 features yielded a higher value of distance factors df for peat depth classes for both polarization channels than those produced by the sigma0 indicating a better performance in discriminating peat depth classes moreover the seasonal variation of rainfall intensity was discovered to be influencing feature selection for peat depth classification thus the combination of gamma0 features derived in the much rain months was selected for separating the shallowand mediumpeat classes whereas those derived in the less rain months was selected for discriminating the deepand very deeppeat classes in addition the developed methodology gave the best accuracy for the very deeppeat class with 76 and 6786 producers accuracy pa and users accuracy ua respectively followed by the shallowpeat class that yielded a pa of 64 and ua of 80 subsequently the deeppeat class produced a pa of 58 and ua of 5918 whereas the mediumpeat class yielded the lowest pa and ua of 54 and 4909 respectively this study showed that the cband dualpolarization sar data have potential for classifying peat depth classes particularly on oil palm plantations and might serve as an efficient tool in peat depth classification used for sustainable management of tropical peatlands,50
Mapping Water Levels across a Region of the Cuvette Centrale Peatland Complex,inundation dynamics are the primary control on greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands situated in the central congo basin the cuvette centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex however our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in its water levels is limited by addressing this gap we can quantify the relationship between the cuvette centrales water levels and greenhouse gas emissions and further provide a baseline from which deviations caused by climate or landuse change can be observed and their impacts understood we present here a novel approach that combines satellitederived rainfall evapotranspiration and lband synthetic aperture radar sar data to estimate spatial and temporal changes in water level across a subregion of the cuvette centrale our key outputs are a map showing the spatial distribution of rainfed and floodprone locations and a daily 100 m resolution map of peatland water levels this map is validated using satellite altimetry data and in situ water table data from water loggers we determine that 50 of peatlands within our study area are largely rainfed and a further 225 are somewhat rainfed receiving hydrological input mostly from rainfall directly and via surfacesubsurface inputs in sloped areas the remaining 275 of peatlands are mainly situated in riverine floodplain areas to the east of the congo river and between the ubangui and congo rivers the mean amplitude of the water level across our study area and over a 20month period is 228 101 cm to 1 standard deviation maximum temporal variations in water levels occur in the riverine floodplain areas and in the interfluvial region between the ubangui and congo rivers our results show that spatial and temporal changes in water levels can be successfully mapped over tropical peatlands using the pattern of net water input rainfall minus evapotranspiration not accounting for runoff and lband sar data 2023 by the authors,51
Progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia,sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services however information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature therefore this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting revegetation of peat soilforest and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands we obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements observations document reviews spatial data from opensource web applications and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects agrisilviculture and agrosylvofishery that adapt paludiculture principles to indonesias south sumatra province we found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration the agrisilviculture project has been utilising jelutung dyera polyphylla ramin gonystylus bancanus and balangeran shorea balangeran for forest revegetation these species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation the revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project additionally in the agrosylvofishery project tradeoffs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide shortterm economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted during the 2019 el nino the involvement of a closedloop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations c 2020 the authors published by elsevier bv,52
Characterizing subsidence in used and restored peatland with Sentinel SAR data,peatland is a fragile ecosystem in the tropical region which is prone to subsidence until now there is still lack of procedure to rapidly assess a tropical peatland subsidence in a large area our objective was to compare subsidence in a used and restored zone in a peatland hydrological unit using synthetic aperture radar data from sentinel1a products sar data in south sumatra indonesia from the period of 20142021 the subsidence rate of used peatland estimated by the dinsar procedure were in the range of 2880 cm year1 in the early period of its utilization and becoming less for the consecutive year 1648 cm year1 meanwhile the subsidence rate based on the field surveys was in the range of 450 cm year1 in the early period of peatland utilization the subsidence rate in the used peatland zone agriculture and plantations was higher than that in the restoration zone for all sar data pairs used in our study the sar data is a potential tool for the assessment monitoring and differentiating subsidence rates among different peatland uses in a large area this tool will help the directorate of peat ecosystem degradation control directorate general of environmental pollution and degradation control and ministry of environment and forestry to plan for better peatland management and restoration,53

Mitigating soil greenhouse-gas emissions from land-use change in tropical peatlands,conversion of tropical peat swamp forests to meet the demand for industrial plantations and agricultural production systems has triggered rapid and substantial carbon loss in the asiapacific region various management practices have been designed to reduce carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from tropical peat soils after changes in land use we conducted a metaanalysis using 506 paired observations on greenhousegas ghg emissions from peat soils under different land uses and the effects of management practices on emissions as compared to peat swamp forest other land uses had higher emissions of co2 heterotrophic respiration and n2o from soils whereas soilbased ch4 emissions were also increased but not significantly so raising the water table decreased co2 emissions but increased n2o emissions reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs led to decreased co2 and n2o emissions in oilpalm elaeis spp plantations and cropping systems and shading and growing cover crops decreased co2 emissions practices such as these are needed for careful management of tropical peatlands and additional measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales are required to guide future ghg mitigation strategies in tropical peatlands,55
Temporal Subset SBAS InSAR Approach for Tropical Peatland Surface Deformation Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 Data,tropical peatland in southeast asia has undergone rapid degradation and shows large subsidence due to oxidation and peat shrinkage the measurement of those deformations is thus valuable for evaluating the peat condition and assessing peat restoration the time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar tinsar especially with the small baseline subsets sbas method is capable of measuring longterm deformation however the dynamic surface scatterers often change in tropical peatland which degrades the coherent scatterer cs distribution density this article presents a simple and efficient tinsar approach that enhances the cs density under such dynamic surface scatter variation based on the sbas method in the presented approach a longtime series of singlelook complex images is separated into subsets and deformation estimation is performed for each subset the effectiveness of this simple solution was investigated by insar simulation and validated using sar observation data we applied the subset sbas approach to the threeyear sentinel1a cband sar dataset acquired over tropical peatland in indonesia the analyses showed an improved number of css for the introduced subset approach we further introduce the color representation of cs temporal behavior per subset for visual interpretation of scatterer change,56
"Targeted land management strategies could halve peatland fire occurrences in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia",indonesian peatlands and their large carbon stores are under threat from recurrent largescale fires driven by anthropogenic ecosystem degradation although the key drivers of peatland fires are known a holistic methodology for assessing the potential of fire mitigation strategies is lacking here we use machine learning convolutional neural network to develop a model capable of recreating historic fire observations based on prefire season parameters using this model we test multiple land management and peatland restoration scenarios and quantify the associated potential for fire reduction we estimate that converting heavily degraded swamp shrubland areas to swamp forest or plantations can reduce fires occurrence by approximately 40 or 55 respectively blocking all but major canals to restore these degraded areas to swamp forest may reduce fire occurrence by 70 our findings suggest that effective land management strategies can influence fire regimes and substantially reduce carbon emissions associated with peatland fires in addition to enabling sustainable management of these important ecosystemsland management scenarios that restore degraded swamp shrubland areas to swamp forest through blocking minor canal systems could substantially reduce peatland fire occurrence and associated greenhouse gas emissions according to a machine learning and numerical modelling study,57
Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems framework into restoration planning,forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation in many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation but success rates vary sociopolitical variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted yet contextual assessments of the biophysical social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare here we integrate a socialecological systems framework with systematic decisionmaking to inform forest restoration planning we illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a communitybased forest restoration context in paser district east kalimantan indonesia we compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone we discover that incorporating a sociopolitical context alters the selection of priority areas while the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced ecological benefits are likely to be reduced andor opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential tradeoffs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,58

How Legal-Oriented Restoration Programs Enhance Landscape Connectivity? Insights From the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity here we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the brazilian forest code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of southeastern brazil we gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2408 rural properties totalizing 748601 ha of farmlands within the atlantic forest biome and its ecotone with cerrado two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation together rural properties account for 50783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on areas of permanent protection apps on the basis of this we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts we evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within apps as determined by the forest code the simulation of restoration at the propertylevel resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size at the sugarcane mill level the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity despite these benefits final forest cover remnant plus restored forests would still be reduced 20the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation the mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in humanmodified tropical landscapes but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests the authors 2018,63
Importance of bistatic SAR features from TanDEM-X for forest mapping and monitoring,deforestation and forest degradation are one of the important sources for human induced carbon dioxide emissions and their rates are highest in tropical forests for mankind it is of great importance to track landuse conversions like deforestation eg for sustainable forest management and land use planning for carbon balancing and to support the implementation of international initiatives like redd reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation sar synthetic aperture radar sensors are suitable to reliably and frequently monitor tropical forests due to their weather independence the tandemx mission which is mainly aimed to create a unique global high resolution digital elevation model currently operates two xband sar satellites acquiring interferometric sar data for the earths entire land surface multiple times the operational mission provides interferometric data as well as mono and bistatic scattering coefficients these datasets are homogenous globally consistent and are acquired in high spatial resolution hence they may offer a unique basic dataset which could be useful in land cover monitoringbased on first datasets available from the tandemx mission the main goal of this research is to investigate the information content of tandemx data for mapping forests and other land cover classes in a tropical peatland area more specifically the study explores the utility of bistatic features for distinguishing between open and closed forest canopies which is of relevance in the context of deforestation and forest degradation monitoring to assess the predominant information content of tandemx data the importance of information derived from the bistatic system is compared against the monostatic case usually available from sar systems the usefulness of the tandemx mission data ie scattering coefficients derived textural information and interferometric coherence is investigated via a feature selection process the resulting optimal feature sets representing a monostatic and a bistatic sar dataset were used in a subsequent classification to assess the added value of the bistatic tandemx features in the separability of land cover classes the results obtained indicated that especially the interferometric coherence significantly improved the separability of thematic classes compared to a dataset of monostatic acquisition the bistatic coherence was mainly governed by volume decorrelation of forest canopy constituents and carries information about the canopy structure which is related to canopy cover in contrast the bistatic scattering coefficient had no significant contribution to class separability the classification with coherence and textural information outperformed the classification with the monostatic scattering coefficient and texture by more than 10 and achieved an overall accuracy of 85 these results indicate that tandemx can serve as a valuable and consistent source for mapping and monitoring tropical forests c 2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved,64
Multicriteria approach to prioritize forest restoration areas for biodiversity conservation in the eastern Amazon,due to the global magnitude of forest degradation and deforestation and the high cost of ecological restoration several approaches have been used to prioritize conservation or restoration areas based on different objectives and criteria the present work aims to develop a multicriteria approach to defining forest restoration priority areas in the itacaitinas river basin eastern amazon that maximizes the criteria equitably the selected criteria were improve forest connectivity provide climatic refuges for biodiversity mitigate the impacts of deforestation on streamflow and improve the probability of natural regeneration a strong difference between selected areas was observed when the criteria of forest connectivity and mitigate the impact on streamflow were considered separately but greater equity among the criteria was achieved using the multicriteria approach the most priority areas were concentrated near protected areas the method used provides a flexible framework and different criteria or subarea selections can be applied for different purposes to facilitate adaptive management analyzing forest restoration prioritization on rural properties can provide guidance for conserving and restoring biodiversity at the landscape scale while complying with legal requirements,65

Recovery of soil phosphorus on former bauxite mines through tropical forest restoration,soil phosphorus p is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils especially when topsoil is removed by mining this nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions which have direct consequences for p availability to plants and consequently for restoration success therefore understanding how the stocks of different soil p fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions monitoring and adaptive management here we investigated the recovery of soil p fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the brazilian atlantic forest we assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic p at 1 a bauxite mine prepared for restoration 2 two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years and 3 an oldgrowth forest remnant overall restored areas recovered levels of labile organic p ponahco3 at 540 cm and of moderately labile organic p ponaoh at different depths exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest the use of prich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome some other fractions however recovered only after 24 years of restoration other inorganic p fractions did not differ among mined restored and conserved sites nonlabile pi residual p and phcl labile pi pinahco3 and moderately labile pi pinaoh forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil p fractions highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining 2020 society for ecological restoration,67
Geographic Setting and Groundwater Table Control Carbon Emission from Indonesian Peatland: A Meta-Analysis,peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving indonesias nationally determined contribution ndc emission reduction target the level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers in this study a metaanalysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total co2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level the tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in indonesia was also calculated the analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations data points for total co2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in indonesia the results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest using the randomeffects model our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total co2 emissions of 27 mg co2 ha1 year1 and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 23 mg co2 ha1 year1 our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve indonesias emission reduction target by 2030 2021 by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland,68
Rapid Response of Bird Communities to Small-Scale Reforestation in Indonesian Borneo,the island of borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world primarily due to agriculture logging and other human activities this habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value by monitoring native bird communities we evaluated the success of two small 20 ha community reforestation projects in gunung palung national park in indonesian borneo birds responded rapidly following reforestation with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site and increasing by 29 in just 3 years at the other final tallies 6370 species per site were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in borneo anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring longterm maintenance even small reforestation sites in borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity,69
The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration restoring lands is especially important in the atlantic forest a global hotspot in brazil threatened by deforestation to successfully restore degraded lands it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation however studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce this lack of information hampers the atlantic forest restoration and given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem this study aimed to assess carbon stocks above and belowground carbon content and carbon isotope at 5year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern brazil the restoration methods tested were active restoration ar assisted restoration asr and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture ap which were compared to a nearby pasture p and a remaining forest fragment rf the assessed pools were tree coarse roots fine roots herbaceous litter standing dead wood fallen dead wood and soil 01 cm 510 cm 1020 cm layers total carbon stock was higher on rf 152304 mg c ha1 followed by the p 84378 mg c ha1 ar 66414 mg c ha1 asr 6573 mg c ha1 and ap 65581 mg c ha1 the restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods however carbon stock and carbon content differed among the pools according to the method and in all cases the largest carbon pool was soil which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content estimation isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources c3 or c4 plants depending on the method we concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon which helps mitigate global warming and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other landuses such as pastures besides the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions local and landscape constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbonsequestration related sciences 2020 elsevier bv,70
Measuring the causal effect of no-till system adoption on Brazilian natural areas,notill system nts is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity therefore employing nts results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas this study aims to evaluate the causal effect between nts adoption and land use decisions in brazil with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas the discussion on the effects of nts use over agricultural practices gains relevance in brazil given the countrys strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity we conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly our statistical results show that the adoption of nts had a positive effect on the natural 0338 pvalue 005 and cultivated agricultural 0214 pvalue 005 areas of the treated municipalities the evidence from this case study indicates that nts allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands preserving natural areas while corroborating borlaugs approach and further reinforcing the use of nts as a sustainable soil management practice 2024 elsevier bv,71
"Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration by applied nucleation: A case study in the Pampa, southern Brazil",temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the pampa biome is still inadequate with a gap in the knowledge of the successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration thus monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration as well as to ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for adaptive management actions in this study the progression of the techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was investigated using ecological indicators the study was carried out in the serra do sudeste in an area of riparian forest the region belongs to the pampa biome southern brazil the evaluations took place in two different monitoring periods the first in 2018 and the second in 2021 in two areas one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other under passive restoration ecological indicators of composition structure and function were measured sampled in 10 plots through monitoring per area the results showed significant differences between the monitoring periods in each area by the kruskalwallis test p 005 the areas presented differences in floristic composition between monitoring periods by nonmetric scaling analysis nmds and differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis simper the dendrometric variables height diameter breast height nuclei area and crown area presented a significant difference by the kruskalwallis test p 005 in the evaluation of the development of the nuclei the ecological indicators of structure canopy cover soil cover by litter and trees and functionality biotic dispersal syndrome were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area under restoration by applied nucleation in the area under passive restoration the indicators of structure litter thickness and soil cover by litter and trees and functionality biotic dispersal syndrome were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period in both areas baccharis dracunculifolia dc was the species that most contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring moments in the development of the nuclei the dendrometric variables were statistically superior in the second monitoring period pointing to progression in the development of the nuclei it is concluded that the restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied area as the nuclei progress over time the area under passive restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession the study result provide support for the improvement in future restoration projects for riparian areas in the pampa biome 2024 elsevier bv,72
Mapping Land Suitability to Guide Landscape Restoration in the Amazon,beyond reducing deforestation the control of forest degradation the promotion of forest restoration and the improvement of agricultural practices in the brazilian amazon are becoming increasingly important for sustainable development to enable farmers and authorities to organize their landscapes and optimize both agricultural practices and the provision of ecosystem services mapping land suitability is essential but it is lacking in the region in this paper we present a method for mapping land suitability at a fine scale 30m pixels adapted to the needs of farmers and municipalities to not only optimize agricultural production but also the ecosystem services provided by forests we used topographic data from the brazilian municipality of paragominas to produce four maps one each of soil texture slope floodplains and hydrography that we then combined into a single land suitability map this map has been incorporated into a spatial database which also contains information on land use remoteness and land tenure we performed spatial analyses to measure the process of land use change and to define indicators that enable local stakeholders to organize landscape restoration we highlight an organic link between agricultural intensification and forest restoration and provide a spatial tool for landscape design assessment and monitoring,73
"Prescribed Burning Reduces Large, High-Intensity Wildfires and Emissions in the Brazilian Savanna",brazil has recently 2014 changed from a zerofire policy to an integrated fire management ifm program with the active use of prescribed burning pb in federal protected areas pa and indigenous territories it of the brazilian savanna cerrado pb is commonly applied in the management of fireprone ecosystems to mitigate large highintensity wildfires the associated emissions and high fire suppression costs however the effectiveness of such fire management in reducing large wildfires and emissions over brazil remains mostly unevaluated here we aim to fill the gap in the scientific evidence of the pb benefits by relying on the most uptodate satellitederived fire datasets of burned area ba fire size duration emissions and intensity from 2003 to 2018 we focused on two cerrado its with different sizes and hydrological regimes xerente and araguaia where ifm has been in place since 2015 to understand fire regime dynamics we divided the study period into three phases according to the prevalent fire policy and the individual fire scars into four size classes we considered two fire seasons management fire season mfs which goes from rainy to middry season when pbs are undertaken and wildfires season wfs when pbs are not performed and fires tend to grow out of control our results show that the implementation of the ifm program was responsible for a decrease of the areas affected by high fire recurrence in xerente and araguaia when compared with the zero fire phase 20082013 in both regions pb effectively reduced the large wildfires occurrence the number of medium and large scars fire intensity and emissions changing the prevalent fire season from the wfs to the mfs such reductions are significant since wfs causes higher negative impacts on biodiversity conservation and higher greenhouse gas emissions we conclude that the effect on wildfires can still be reduced if effective fire management policies including pb continue to be implemented during the coming decades,74
Reference and comparison values for ecological indicators in assessing restoration areas in the Atlantic Forest,information on reference values is one of the great demands in ecological restoration as they enable evaluating the restoration progress and taking adaptive management measures here we aimed to i verify whether ecological indicators are influenced by the area of reference ecosystems mature fragments ii determine reference and comparison values for comparing the restoration progress and iii check how long restoration forests take to reach naturalness values that are like the reference ecosystems and can therefore be considered restored we used the brazilian atlantic forest as an object of study and compilated information about 967 secondary mature and restoration forests in a wide geographical extension in total 14 ecological indicators were assessed in a sampling area of 1928024 m2 we used simple linear regression to analyze the data and descriptive statistics for creating the reference and comparison values we found that ecological indicators were not related to the area of mature fragments thus they are useful for monitoring reference ecosystems of different sizes and more attention can be given to the degree of conservation of the ecosystems we defined intermediate and final reference values from secondary and mature forests respectively we also established comparison values for several restoration stages using data of planting assisted and unassisted restoration areas at the same time we applied the concept of naturalness in restoration and obtained a continuum of naturalness which was very useful for tracking the restoration progress with the reference and comparison values determined restoration practitioners can evaluate their restoration areas by comparing their monitoring results with ours moreover by using the naturalness concept we verified that indicators can have different restoration trajectories some indicators reached similar naturalness levels as references from the beginning of restoration but others required between one and two decades to recover this study is the first to create evaluation criteria for forest restoration based on a large data set and we hope that similar studies can be developed in other biomes 2019 elsevier ltd,75
Thinning temporarily stimulates tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest,when an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory management interventions may be warranted where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities reduction of stand basal area ba by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration although it can also damage young plants we ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning we applied two intensities of thinning to a 22yrold restored forest in southeastern brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning unthinned plots were retained as controls thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible far below annual mortality in control plots positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area ca 30 below the reference forests with increases in seedling density numbers of recruits and seedlingtosapling and saplingtotree transitions understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning these changes however were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration frequency and intensity of thinning operations however should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data 2021 elsevier bv,76
A generalizable monitoring model to implement policies to promote forest restoration - A case study in Sao Paulo - Brazil,examples of largescale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets given the increasing investment of time effort and money in restoration there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness some countries are already conducting monitoring programs but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation with the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs the aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes the so paulo forest restoration program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model this paper presents the conceptual model emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review the resulting forest management decisions support system fmdss embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an autoupdatable knowledge base the result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the fmdss the restoration of degraded areas in a case with 40000 rural properties serves as the case study although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations additionally conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes supported by an autoupdatable knowledge base mitigate the risk of failures mainly when the comprehensive gathering of wellestablished references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset 2018 elsevier bv,77
Amazonian dark earths enhance the establishment of tree species in forest ecological restoration,introductiondeforestation of areas for agriculture and cattle breeding is the leading cause of ecological degradation and loss of biodiversity the solution to mitigate these damages relies on techniques that improve soil health and the microbial quality of these degraded areas here we demonstrate that the high nutrient and microbiological contents of amazonian dark earths ade can promote the development of trees used in ecological restoration projectsmethodswe used degraded soil from crops as control and ade from the central amazon to conduct the experiment using 20 of ade as inoculum in degraded agricultural soil our goal was to assess whether a small amount of ade could promote changes that improve plant development similar to its growth under a 100ade we simulated conversion from pasture to forest restoration area by planting u brizantha in all pots after 60 days we removed it and planted cecropia pachystachya peltophorum dubium and cedrela fissilisresultsour results demonstrated that both 20ade and 100ade treatments increased pasture productivity and consequently soil carbon stock also in these treatments p dubium and c fissilis had better growth and development with 20ade plants showing a performance similar to those planted in 100ade both 20ade and 100ade showed similar numbers of taxa being significantly higher than in the control soildiscussionthe 20ade was sufficient to increase significantly the microbial richness in the soil providing several beneficial microorganisms to all tree species such as pedomicrobium candidatus nitrososphaera and members of paenebacillaceae nevertheless c pachystachya a common pioneer tree in the amazonian forest showed a small response even to 100ade with a corresponding lower taxa number than the other two species in conclusion we point out that microbial structure remains very similar among plants but dissimilar among treatments highlighting the role of ade as an enhancer of plant development and beneficial microbiota enrichment in the rhizosphere the use of 20ade was sufficient to alter the microbial community therefore we believe our data could contribute to speeding up forest restoration programs by adopting new biotechnological approaches for forest restoration ecology,78
State of the art and for remote sensing monitoring of carbon dynamics in African tropical forests,african tropical forests play a crucial role in global carbon dynamics biodiversity conservation and climate regulation yet monitoring their structure diversity carbon stocks and changes remains challenging remote sensing techniques including multispectral data lidarbased canopy height and vertical structure detection and radar interferometry have significantly improved our ability to map forest composition estimate height and biomass and detect degradation and deforestation features at a finer scale machine learning approaches further enhance these capabilities by integrating multiple data sources to produce improved maps of forest attributes and track changes over time despite these advancements uncertainties remain due to limited groundtruth validation and the structural complexity and large spatial heterogeneity of african forests future developments in remote sensing should examine how multisensor integration of highresolution data from instruments such as planet tandemx spot and improved ai methods can refine forest composition carbon storage and function maps enhance largescale monitoring of tree height and biomass dynamics and improve forest degradation and deforestation detection down to tree level these advancements will be essential for supporting sciencebased decisionmaking in forest conservation and climate mitigation copyright 2025 bossy ciais renaudineau wan ygorra adam barbier bauters delbart frappart gara hamunyela ifo jaffrain maisongrande mugabowindekwe mugiraneza normandin obame peaucelle pinet ploton sagang schwartz sollier sonk tresson de truchis vo quang and wigneron,79

Large-scale forest restoration generates comprehensive biodiversity gains in an Amazonian mining site,to reconcile environmental issues with socioeconomic development the mitigation hierarchy emerges as a pivotal strategy that sequentially addresses environmental impacts through a structured approach of avoidance minimization remediation and offsetting no net loss nnl is achieved when biodiversity gains from all four mitigation stages are larger than the projects environmental impacts here we assessed biodiversity changes linked to the implementation of the s11d eliezer batista iron mining complex in the carajs national forest par state brazil expecting losses due to mining activities and gains through forest restoration offsets we evaluated biodiversity stocks based on biotic value as the product of habitat importance and actual conditions habitat importance a unique value for each class of land cover recognized within the study site is based on the evaluation of habitat naturalness rarity and endangerment and substitutability actual conditions are computed from fieldsurveyed key ecological attributes of vegetation structure community composition and diversity and ecological processes and forest restoration activities are able to restitute within 46 years only approximately 73 of oldgrowth forest conditions the biotic value ranges from 0 for mine lands to 1 for patchy savanna formations stocking above ironstone outcrops locally known as cangas and amounts to 043 unitsha for secondary forests between 2008 and 2021 we detected comprehensive landuse changes in the study area cangas farmlands and oldgrowth forests decreased while secondary forests and minelands increased considerably despite environmental degradation the emergence of secondary forests contributed to a positive biodiversity balance within the areas managed by the mining company 379 units while biodiversity losses dominated outside the companys boundaries 171 units although likeforlike compensation of canga impacts remains challenging we thus conclude that forest restoration efforts initiated by the mining company effectively reversed the trajectory of environmental degradation prevailing in the landscape and provided considerable biodiversity gains for the region 2024 the authors,89
Forest restoration monitoring through digital processing of high resolution images,monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in largescale but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time the objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using light detection and ranging lidar data and multispectral imaging from unmanned aerial vehicle uav camera in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms maximum likelihood ml and random forest rf the study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation owned by fibria celulose sa in the southern region of bahia state brazil we used images from canon s110 nir green red near infrared on uav and lidar data composition intensity image digital surface model digital terrain model normalized digital surface model the monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes canopy cover bare soil and grass cover the images were classified using the ml and rf algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of the classifications the overall accuracy oa and the kappa index were used and the last was compared by z test the area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using arcgis and r the results of oa kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed when kappa values for the two algorithms were compared rf presented better performance than ml with significant difference but when sensors uav camera and lidar were compared there were no significant differences there was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by uav and lidar images the highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success the methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas especially on a large scale allowing us to save time fieldwork and invested resources 2018 elsevier bv,90
Ecological indicators of passive restoration in South Brazil's Atlantic Forest areas with former Pinus taeda L. plantations,the use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural regeneration and the restoration course however most developed restoration protocols in brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration in this context we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol sma resolution 322014 formulated for active restoration along with other indicators of richness diversity and functional aspects of natural regeneration the evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes between three and twelve years old and in a secondary riparian forest reference ecosystem inside the mixed ombrophilous forest araucaria forest in south brazil those sites had previously been covered and degraded by pinus taeda l plantations we compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process results showed that the canopy cover density and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry however it is necessary to adapt the protocols reference values we further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystems structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover dispersion syndrome life form and the ecological group of species as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels despite the low similarity in composition structure and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas 2022 elsevier bv,91
Effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on lizard communities in the Brazilian Cerrado,the rapid expansion of human altered landscapes affects biodiversity on every continent a fundamental goal of conservation biologists is to understand why certain species are at risk of extinction while others are able to persist in human altered landscapes afforestation the conversion of unforested lands to planted forest is rapidly altering many natural landscapes worldwide in the cerrado brazilian savanna a global biodiversity hotspot a shortage of government incentives has the landscape riddled with abandoned plantation forests that are not subject to active restoration projects studies investigating the impacts of abandoned plantations on biodiversity are strikingly limited we examine the effects of abandoned eucalyptus plantations on the structure of cerrado lizard communities we assessed changes in lizard capture richness and equitability along cerrado sensu strictoeucalyptus transects our results indicate abandoned eucalyptus plantations have subsets of cerrado species persisting with a great loss of endemic species the cerrado sensu strictoeucalyptus linear transect analysis demonstrated distance from native habitat is positively correlated with loss of biodiversity we performed correspondence analyses to summarize the variation in species captures across different sites habitats and pitfall array positions these analyses depicted strong species associations between habitats and their pitfall array positions this study is the first to show the negative impacts of abandoned eucalyptus plantations on cerrado lizard communities serving as a cautionary tale of cerrado biodiversity nonresilience in abandoned eucalyptus plantations mitigation requires that abandoned eucalyptus plantations are made more suitable to cerrado lizards by implementing targeted habitat heterogeneity restoration,92
Shifts in composition of avian communities related to temperate-grassland afforestation in southeastern South America,afforestation of temperate grasslands with fastgrowing trees for industrial pulpwood production is spreading in south america despite high afforestation rates resulting from governmental policies that stimulate pulpwood production in grasslands of southern brazil and uruguay the impact of this activity on biodiversity remains to be properly assessed we used an impactreference study design to evaluate how grassland afforestation affects the composition of grassland bird assemblages we sampled eucalyptus plantations and neighboring natural grasslands in southern brazil from 20062009 and relied on nested sampling and analysis to separate the effects of afforestation from the natural variability of grasslands we recorded a significant difference in composition between assemblages from grasslands and tree plantations species adapted to open treeless areas tended to be negatively affected in relation to edge or forest birds in eucalyptus plantations afforestation is systematically replacing the bird assemblage of hilltop grasslands by a collection of common edge and forest species that occur in nearby riverine and hillside forests although most grassland birds negatively affected by tree plantations are common and widespread observed and predicted afforestation rates in southeastern south america may result in regional population reductions in the near future,93
Simulating land use and land cover change under contrasting levels of policy enforcement and its spatially-explicit impact on tropical forest landscapes in Ecuador,this study simulates the future impact of land use and land cover lulc change and the enforcement of policy bundles on the multifunctionality of tropical forest landscapes it focusses on the northern ecuadorian amazonas nea which is characterised by high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time is threatened by deforestation and unsustainable land use practices scenario simulations mimic lulc change during 20162030 at cantonlevel area 2146 km2 combining explorative with policyscreening components scenarios nationalpolicy nationalpolicy regionalpolicy and regionalpolicy are contrasted by varying deforestation trends high regional demand for agricultural products vs nationallevel structural transformations and the enforcement nonenforcement of policy bundles on forest protection reforestation and restoration an indicatorbased impact assessment analysed in a spatiallyexplicit fashion for each scenario in 2030 i the evolution of agricultural and forestryrelated lulc change trajectories ii future hotspots of deforestation iii remaining forest core zones fcz as key element of habitat integrity and iv the provisioning of longterm carbon sinks key findings reveal that only nationalpolicy as the combination of enforced policy bundles and simulated national lulc change trend extrapolating the longterm reference period 19902016 lead to an expansion of forest areas and a 2 carbon stock gain in 2030 compared to 2016 when assuming a linear continuation of this trend it requires 96 years to reach a similar carbon stock level compared to the reference year 1990 farm area expansion will continue to affect protected forests in case of scenarios nationalpolicy and regionalpolicy but will be avoided in nationalpolicy and regionalpolicy the simulated persistence of many farming areas reveals that the likelihood to reforest existing agricultural patches will be rather low against expectations scenario nationalpolicy which assumes net zero deforestation by 2030 led to a high level of fcz fragmentation contrasting its carbon sink potential 27971 mio mg ha1 which performed best among all scenarios our study depicts a mismatch of future lulc change realities compared to the anticipated future achievements of the ecuadorian land use policy framework the simulated variability of forest change patterns deforestation reforestation and farming trajectories diversification intensification rotation further suggests to foster more crosssectoral policy approaches that acknowledges the hybrid role of local stakeholders who can be farmers and forest users at the same time our study shows that focusing on preserving carbon stocks and their longterm climate mitigation potential only while neglecting other important ecosystem functions or biodiversity can be a shortsighted policy goal if not accompanied by rural development programmes we further conclude that scenariobased assessments should become an integral part of multistakeholder interactions across relevant levels of decisionmaking this can support longterm sustainable land use management which is not only relevant for the case of the northern ecuadorian amazons region but for many other landscapes in transition,94
Productivity assessment of timber harvesting techniques for supporting sustainable forest management of secondary Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil,the atlantic forest in southern brazil has been subject to overexploitation in the past prompting the formulation of a rigorous conservation orientated policy by the government including a strict ban of timber harvesting in the region the forestland is mostly owned by farmers the economic value of the forest is rather limited for those farmers because of the prohibition of commercial timber harvesting as a source of income sustainable forest management systems can offer great potential as new income opportunities for land holders and further actively support the process of ecosystem rehabilitation and protection of these ecosystems yet successful implementation of such sustainable management systems requires feasible and adapted timber harvesting systems in order to develop such harvesting systems a regional comparative case study was conducted at a typical smallholder forestry venture with the objective to analyze and evaluate harvesting methods supporting sustainable management of the atlantic forest this study assessed production rates and associated costs of a common conventional timber harvesting method cm and a proposed alternative method am cm was performed by a selected typical forest landowner who had only basic training in chainsaw operations but 20 years of experience at the wood yard of his small sawmill in contrast am employed a professional chainsaw operator from the amazon forest trained and experienced in reduced impact logging techniques using state of the art equipment supplemented by a snatch block and a skidding cone for improved extraction time study based models identified tree volume winching distance and skidding distance to landing as the most significant independent variables affecting productivity total net productivity ranged from 49 m3 pmh01 for cm to 31 m3 pmh01 for am corresponding grossproductivity ranged from 30 m3 smh1 to 19 m3 smh1 with an overall mean utilization rate of 608 and 609 respectively for cm and am associated harvesting costs ranged from 1205 m3 to 2094 m3 with an estimated annual production of 4000 m3 and 2700 m3 respectively although am showed overall lower productivity and higher costs it enabled important improvements in terms of occupational health and safety in conclusion a suitable harvesting system should integrate local experiences of cm and proposed technical improvements of am 2017 editura silvica all rights reserved,95

Assessing the Impacts of Selective Logging on the Forest Understory in the Amazon Using Airborne LiDAR,reducedimpact logging ril has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management sfm areas however monitoring the forest understorya critical area for assessing logging impactsremains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system gnss surveys which are timeconsuming costly and often lack accuracy in complex environments additionally aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts this study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model rdm derived from airborne lidar data for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances a fieldbased validation of lidarderived rdm was conducted across 25 sites totaling 55045 hectares within the jamari national forest rondnia brazil the results indicate that the rdm accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure with over 90 agreement with gnss field data however the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails which despite their lower accuracy in modeling accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure the findings include the mapping of 351 km of primary roads 1174 km of secondary roads 5956 km of skid trails and 323 log landings with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure it is recommended that airborne lidar assessments be conducted up to two years postlogging as impacts become less detectable over time this study highlights lidar data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in sfm areas of the amazon providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts 2025 by the authors,110
Evaluating the effectiveness of protected area management in Indonesia,protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity natural habitats ecosystem services and cultural values yet despite their importance the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago to assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas the government of indonesia applied an adapted version of the management effectiveness tracking tool mett to assess 422 of the countrys protected areas of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015 2017 and 2019 we investigated the mett score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores over the study years mett scores significantly improved mean increase of 441 national parks had the highest mean score which was 134 points higher than other protected area types after correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized leastsquares model we found that mett score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a wellresourced management authority with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha the assessments identified five main threats to protected areas poaching illegal logging human settlements tourism and nontimber cultivation the widespread and repeated use of mett across the protected areas of indonesia and the increasing mett scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism building on the foundational work in our study future studies should assess the association between mett scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas copyright the authors 2024,111
Soil macrofauna density and diversity across a chronosequence of tropical forest restoration in Southeastern Brazil,edaphic macrofauna must be better studied if we want to take advantage of their full potential for the restoration of tropical ecosystems we investigated changes in edaphic macrofauna density and diversity along a secondary succession chronosequence in the atlantic forest our results show some clear patterns of change in soil macrofauna along the chronosequence density did not increase along secondary succession but was correlated with canopy cover diversity was characterized by high dominance of social insects and evenness among other groups we conclude soil macrofauna has a high capacity to recolonize young forests and that its recovery is considerably fast compared to other ecosystem transformations,112
Characterizing aboveground biomass and tree cover of regrowing forests in Brazil using multi-source remote sensing data,characterization of regrowing forests is vital for understanding forest dynamics to assess the impacts on carbon stocks and to support sustainable forest management although remote sensing is a key tool for understanding and monitoring forest dynamics the use of exclusively remotely sensed data to explore the effects of different variables on regrowing forests across all biomes in brazil has rarely been investigated here we analyzed how environmental and human factors affect regrowing forests based on brazils secondary forest age map 3060 locations disturbed between 1984 and 2018 were sampled interpreted and analyzed in different biomes we interpreted the time since disturbance for the sampled pixels in google earth engine elevation slope climatic water deficit cwd the total nitrogen of soil cation exchange capacity cec of soil surrounding tree cover distance to roads distance to settlements and fire frequency were analyzed in their importance for predicting aboveground biomass agb and tree cover derived from global forest aboveground biomass map and tree cover map respectively results show that time since disturbance interpreted from satellite time series is the most important predictor for characterizing agb and tree cover of regrowing forests agb increased with increasing time since disturbance surrounding tree cover soil total n slope distance to roads distance to settlements and decreased with larger fire frequency cwd and cec of soil tree cover increased with larger time since disturbance soil total n surrounding tree cover distance to roads distance to settlements slope and decreased with increasing elevation and cwd these results emphasize the importance of remotely sensing products as key opportunities to improve the characterization of forest regrowth and to reduce data gaps and uncertainties related to forest carbon sink estimation our results provide a better understanding of regional forest dynamics toward developing and assessing effective forestrelated restoration and climatic mitigation strategies 2023 the authors remote sensing in ecology and conservation published by john wiley sons ltd on behalf of zoological society of london,113
Conservation agriculture assists smallholder farmers and their agroecosystem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,conservation agriculture a sustainable farming practice combining no or minimum soil disturbance crop diversification and soil cover can benefit humans and the biophysical environment however less than half of subsaharan african countries implement conservation agriculture and the majority of smallholder farmers are using unsustainable practices research and field trials on conservation agriculture adaptation to soil and agroecological conditions are vital for increasing adoption of conservation agriculture in subsaharan africa the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the change in soil chemical properties and soil biology from implementation of conservation agriculture ii assess cowpea vigna unguiculata l walp yield and variability under conservation agriculture compared to the conventional farming practice and iii evaluate differences in soil chemical properties soil biology and crop yields under conservation agriculture in savannah and forest ecosystems compared to conventional agriculture in smallholder farming in the province of maniema in the democratic republic of the congo soils under conservation agriculture had 65 times more p 0001 earthworms 23 and 10 greater p 005 concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium respectively and 100 greater p 0001 cowpea yield than soils under conventional agriculture measured across all sites conservation agriculture and conventional cowpea yields had coefficients of variation of 25 and 16 respectively this study showed for the first time that conservation agriculture implementation contributes to soil health and food security associated with smallholder farming in the democratic republic of the congo 2023 the authors,114
Can mulch be effective in controlling exotic grasses and promoting natural regeneration in ecological restoration?,mulching use in agriculture has been known since 1802 as the practice of spreading dry leaves and straw on the soil to prevent erosion and water loss our study evaluated the mulch effectiveness in the establishment of regenerating seedlings and its contribution to the control of exotic grasses the studies were carried out in an ecological restoration area in the municipality of itapirasp the treatment with mulching consisted in chemical desiccation with glyphosate herbicide application keeping the dry grass on the ground in the control treatment after chemical weeding the grass was removed with manual mowing exposing the soil eight months after implantation we sampled all regenerating seedlings in 100 plots of 50 x 50 cm in each treatment we considered as seedlings all individuals of tree species less than 100 cm tall we calculated richness abundance similarity and the relationship of the frequency of seedlings to the height of the mulch we sampled eight species with 42 seedlings with only one not identified the highest abundance and species richness were found in the treatment with mulch n 34 individuals eight species the most abundant being schinus terebinthifolia raddi 14 individuals followed by solanum mauritianum scop 11 individuals and platypodium elegans vog three individuals the presence of exotic grasses was lower in the plots of the mulching 13 compared to the control treatment 67 the highest frequency of seedlings was obtained with mulch height from 21 to 37 cm we suggest that adaptive management practices such as the use of the mulching technique can be implemented in ecological restoration areas because they favor the natural regeneration of native seedlings and can contribute to the control of exotic grasses but the height of the layer must be controlled,115
Influence of Removal of a Non-native Tree Species Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. on the Regenerating Plant Communities in a Tropical Semideciduous Forest Under Restoration in Brazil,exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on since such species can provide a marketable product firewood their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits in this study we looked at the effect of removal of a nonnative tree species mimosa caesalpiniifolia on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration we assessed two 14yearold plantation systems modified taungya agroforestry system and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in so paulo state brazil the experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots the natural regeneration of woody species height 02m was compared between managed all m caesalpiniifolia trees removed and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention the removal of m caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area nevertheless the basal area loss was recovered after 1year the management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups the results of this study suggest that removal of m caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition the lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings 2015 springer sciencebusiness media new york,116
Enhancing ecological connectivity through biodiversity offsets to mitigate impacts on habitats of large mammals in tropical forest environments,habitat loss and fragmentation are ecological impacts of development projects known to have severe effects on mammals populations here we study the role of connectivity assessment in environmental impact assessment focusing on its contribution to determining appropriate mitigation in particular biodiversity offsetting for that purpose we analysed the dispersal of large mammals in a region potentially influenced by a mine located in the atlantic rainforest in brazil and anticipate the longterm outcomes of restoration offsets by modelling a 30year postoffset scenario results show that i offsets enhance ecological connectivity and are used as an alternative habitat for the animals dispersed due to habitat loss and fragmentation ii the location of restoration areas should be carefully planned to maximize their contribution to increase ecological connectivity and enhance habitat quality the reviewed case suggests that best practices to incorporate connectivity analysis in environmental impact assessment include i monitoring biodiversity to quantify losses and gains ii modelling offset areas alternatives for both protection and restoration and iii conducting rigorous analysis of project alternatives aiming at impact avoidance,117
Lessons on direct seeding to restore Neotropical savanna,tropical grasslandsavanna mosaics are threatened globally but they are challenging to restore because highly competitive pasture grasses inhibit recovery and are not shaded out by the patchy tree cover we analyzed the outcomes of restoration projects and experiments established over four years in 55 ha of abandoned pastures dominated by invasive c4 grasses within the neotropical savanna central brazil we tested the efficacy of direct seeding native grasses forbs shrubs and trees in reducing invasive grass cover and increasing native ground cover we performed a series of experiments aimed at answering questions about the effect of seeding density soil plowing to control invasive grasses life form of ground cover species grass forb or shrub and soil type on restoration outcomes relative native cover reached 34 3 three rainy seasons after the first seeding experiment higher seeding densities and more soil plowing repetitions increased relative native cover soil type interacted with the life form of ground cover species to strongly influence relative native cover two years after seeding the highest relative native cover was achieved in rocky soils seeded with grasses 78 6 and the lowest was for seasonally waterlogged soils seeded with shrubs 15 4 direct seeding can effectively establish many native neotropical savanna species of different life forms with better restoration outcomes on rocky soils and with higher seeding densities further research is urgent to improve restoration methods especially to control invasive grasses to be able to achieve the largescale restoration targets set internationally,118
Direct seeding of native fruit tree species with economic benefits in a Brazilian Cerrado managed landscape,planting native species of economic interest is attractive to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation because of their potential to generate income products and services combining socioeconomic and environmental demands direct seeding is a lowcost restoration technique compared to nurseryraised seedling planting but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in brazil we tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the brazilian cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern minas gerais state southeastern brazil we monitored germination survival growth and establishment for three years of the 9000seeds planted 187 germinated 298 survived and 89 were established three years after sowing eugenia dysenterica mart dc and dypterix alata vogel had higher germination survival and establishment rates and are thus the most appropriate species e dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed cerrado and d alata in agroforestry system hillside fields and lower field the species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility however phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the cerrado is promising to some species and to others the sowing should be done with more seeds or using nurseryraised seedling the planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods 2022 the authors under exclusive licence to botanical society of sao paulo,119

Do alien species dominate plant communities undergoing restoration? A case study in the Brazilian savanna,among the principles established by the society for ecological restoration international ser is that the use of exotic species for restoration purposes should be avoided and this is outlined on the two first attributes expected of a restored ecosystem by the ser primer this recommendation is possibly based on the hypothesis that exotics will dominate the restored communities and jeopardize the local biodiversity we assessed the current plant community in an area of the brazilian cerrado undergoing restoration where 42 species 6 natives and 36 nonnatives were planted and compared it with the contiguous native community we aimed at verifying if the surrounding native community has been invaded by alien species and if the community being restored has been dominated by the latter not resembling the native flora eight years after planting the alien species were not recorded in the surrounding native ecosystem in the community undergoing restoration despite 94 of the planted trees being exotics 86 of the species they corresponded to only 3 of plants regenerating 14 of the species indicating that floristic similarity with the native vegetation is increasing over time we consider that the nonnative species planted do not offer threat to the native ecosystems in the vicinity and tend to be defeated by the natives in the long term even though public policies should prioritize and make feasible the use of native species better adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the cerrado,126

Greenhouse Gas Mitigation through Sustainable Intensification of Livestock Production in the Brazilian Cerrado,brazilian greenhouse gas emissions ghg are projected to reach 32 gigatonnes co2 eq by 2020 the government has made a voluntary commitment to reduce this figure by 40 per cent a reduction in deforestation and livestock mitigation measures are key components of this commitment focusing on the cerrado core central brazilian savannah we analyse abatement potential and costeffectiveness of ghg mitigation measures applicable to livestock production we focus on the role of intensification measures particularly pasture restoration and animal performance to meet the objectives of increasing beef production to meet higher demand while simultaneously reducing emissions we use a linear programming model that optimises pasture intensification levels according to biophysical and economic parameters and growth in beef demand we estimate changes in soil carbon stocks generated by pasture management and land use change according to a baseline projection beef production in the cerrado accounts for an average of approximately 122 million tonnes of co2 eq per year from 2010 to 2030 the results of our analysis suggest that by implementing costeffective measures projected emissions in the region could be reduced by around 24 per cent pasture restoration which will reduce deforestation is the largest contributor to these results,128
"Role of Tree Vegetation and Associated Environmental Factors on the Understory Herb-Layer Composition in a Reforested Area: A Study from ""Kulon Progo Community Forestry""",we assessed the understory herblayer species composition in response to tree vegetation and its associated environmental factors in the reforested area of the kulon progo community forestry yogyakarta indonesia the understory herblayer composition among different stand types including pinus pn aleuritesswietenia as swieteniaacacia sa melaleucaacacia ma and tectonadalbergia td was compared using some comparison analyses the influence of tree vegetation characteristics and associated environmental factors on the understory herblayer species was analyzed by employing canonical correspondence analysis cca our result showed variation in understory herblayer species composition despite equality in richness and diversity indices among all stand types the ma stand showed fewer shadetolerant species and the td stand exhibited the smallest number of shadeintolerant species seedling availability also varied between as and ma which contained fewer seedling species one of the main species in the two stands did not even regenerate moreover all indicator species in ma were shadeintolerant species with invasive characteristics while those in td were shadetolerant and semishadetolerant species cca showed that stand types held an important role in the herblayer species composition where the number of shadetolerant and seedling species commonly native to forest were directly proportional to tree canopy coverage silt proportion in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon yet inversely proportional to belowstand utilization in contrast the number of shadeintolerant species had positive correlation to belowstand utilization and inversely to other correlated factors our study also indicated the possibility of tree vegetation controlling several environmental factors where the increase in canopy coverage was followed by an increasing proportion of silt in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon as well as a decreasing percentage of belowstand utilization accordingly we recommend tree species enrichment with densecanopy trees and adaptive management of belowstand utilization for better forest development and tree regeneration this finding provides important knowledge for evaluation and improvement in the ecological restoration of degraded forests 2023 by the authors,129
"Adaptation of a spatially explicit individual tree-based growth and yield model and long-term comparison between reduced-impact and conventional logging in eastern Amazonia, Brazil",timber logging is one of the main land uses in the brazilian amazon despite its recognized potential as a sustainable activity logging is generally conducted in an unsustainable or predatory manner with significant negative environmental impact there is increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable practices and reducedimpact logging ril is gaining acceptance as a more environmentally benign alternative to unplanned conventional logging cl comparisons of these two harvest systems have largely focused on differences in efficiency financial and immediate impacts on stand structure residual timber stocks and the physical environment growth and yield simulation models allow longterm predictions about the response of forests to disturbance from harvesting information that is essential to determine the effects of different management systems and to establish systems for the regulation or control of timber that are compatible with sustainable forest management we describe the calibration of a spatially explicit individual treebased ecological model within the symforsimflora framework for forests located near paragominas in eastern amazonia data originated from an experiment comparing ril to cl within an area of 735 ha monitored over a period of 10 years we evaluated biological realism and accuracy of the model concluding that forest dynamics are adequately represented this model was used to evaluate longterm effects of ril and cl on the forest our results suggest that total and commercial volume recovery following ril are faster than following cl it takes 10 and 3040 years to recover total and commercial volume under ril while under cl it takes 3540 and over 60 years respectively despite benefits from ril as currently practiced this logging system does not result in longterm sustained timber yields reinforcing results from previous studies indicating that ril must be combined with appropriate systems for yield regulation in the absence of silvicultural treatments the model suggests that successive ril harvests at current intensities will produce stands dominated by pioneer species groups with few trees belonging to the emergent species group and an increased proportion of defective trees in commercial size classes these changes in stand composition present challenges to the longterm financial viability of ril as currently applied in the amazon region 2007 elsevier bv all rights reserved,130

Bigger is better: Improved nature conservation and economic returns from landscape-level mitigation,impact mitigation is a primary mechanism on which countries rely to reduce environmental externalities and balance development with conservation mitigation policies are transitioning from traditional projectbyproject planning to landscapelevel planning although this largerscale approach is expected to provide greater conservation benefits at the lowest cost empirical justification is still scarce using commercial sugarcane expansion in the brazilian cerrado as a case study we apply economic and biophysical steadystate models to quantify the benefits of the brazilian forest code fc under landscapeand propertylevel planning we find that fc compliance imposes small costs to business but can generate significant longterm benefits to nature supporting 32 37 additional species largely habitat specialists storing 593000 to 2280000 additional tons of carbon worth 69 million to 265 million pertains to us dollars and marginally improving surface water quality relative to propertylevel compliance we find that landscapelevel compliance reduces total business costs by 19 million to 35 million per 6year sugarcane growing cycle while often supporting more species and storing more carbon our results demonstrate that landscapelevel mitigation provides costeffective conservation and can be used to promote sustainable development,132
"Felids in an agricultural landscape in Sao Paulo, Brazil",we surveyed felids in an agricultural landscape in sao paulo brazil from july 2003 to june 2004 a total of 284 km was walked in transects distributed among the following landscape attributes semideciduous native forest fragments eucalyptus plantations sugarcane plantations and exotic pastures the diversity and abundance of felid species were evaluated in the mosaic and we tested possible differences in frequency of occurrence and species richness according to the land use type by using nested anova we found a total of five felid species and the analysis showed no differences for both frequency of occurrence and species richness we also compared the abundance of species found through studies using similar methodology in different areas by using the kruskalwallis test and no differences in abundance were found results demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining data about felid abundance even after one year of fieldwork however we could confirm the species occurrence in the area and the similarity found in species abundance in our region and in more conserved areas allows us to say that neotropical wild felids can survive in agricultural landscapes as long as native forest fragments remain in the area current environmental laws should thus be enforced in order to improve forest conservation and to mitigate the possible impacts of agriculture paper industry and livestock production on those species,133
Early responses of regeneration to weeding and herbicide application to control Guinea-grass in a 20-year-old Atlantic Forest undergoing restoration,among the invasive grasses harming natural ecosystems in brazil guineagrass megathyrsus maximus has received significant attention due to its high invasive potential and damage it causes to restoration sites here we show the response of seedlings 10cm to 1m and saplings 1m one year after guineagrass removal in a 20yearold restoration site in the atlantic forest thirty 10 20 m plots were installed and assigned into three treatments control mechanical removal using gastrimmers and mechanical removal followed by the application of roundup transorb r glyphosate forest canopy and grass cover were also assessed guineagrass was negatively correlated with woody species richness and abundance forest canopy cover was positively related to species richness and abundance and negatively related to guineagrass treatments applied were successful in controlling the plant invader and did not cause any significant reduction in the total abundance or richness of saplings after one year for seedlings however the abundance and richness of pioneer woody species increased over time with mechanical removal while the abundance and richness of nonpioneer woody species decreased in plots treated with herbicide we expect regeneration responses to continue to improve with time our results support the use of both herbicide and mechanical removal to reduce guineagrass in atlantic forest sites undergoing restoration although the use of herbicide lowers native seedling richness in the shortterm while mechanical removal may be better for small sites where it is more feasible and less demanding 2022 society for ecological restoration,134
Delimitation of Ecological Corridor Using Technological Tools,ecological corridors are effective strategies to address the environmental consequences of forest fragmentation by connecting fragmented areas through various techniques this study aims to propose the implementation of an ecological corridor in the itapemirim river basin in espirito santo brazil the specific objectives of this study are as follows delimiting the permanent preservation areas apps in the itapemirim river watershed and comparing land use and land cover within these areas the mapbiomas platform and landsat 8 satellite images were utilized to map land use and land cover while the criteria set by law no 12651 were followed to define the app boundaries the calculation of the landscape ecology indices and the identification of the forest fragments with the highest potential for ecological corridor implementation were conducted using the fuzzy logic the qgis 326 application along with the lecos 301 plugin and fragstats 42 were employed to characterize and quantify landscape ecology indices the costs assessment and determination of the optimal route for implementing the ecological corridor were performed considering bothdistance and physical impediments the least cost path algorithm was utilized taking into account land use and land cover app fragment potential slope and subnormal clusters evaluating land costs and expropriation expenses required to define the ecological corridor in the study area the identified forest fragments for inclusion in the ecological corridor were the caparao national park the serra das torres state natural monument and other selected fragments based on the application of fuzzy logic to landscape ecology indices the corridor route was determined using the least cost path algorithm considering various factors this study revealed that the predominant land use and land cover class in the area is pasture and a significant portion 6858 of the designated permanent preservation areas were in conflict with legal regulations the bare land value per hectare for pasture was the second highest among the land use and land cover categories accounting for 6428 of the total the priority area analysis indicated that 3186 of the region had high or very high importance for forest restoration while 4297 had low or very low priority the findings demonstrate that the least cost path algorithm coupled with a multicriteria decisionmaking approach using the analytic hierarchy process ahp is a valuable tool for planning and implementing ecological networks these methods effectively consider critical factors in decisionmaking processes related to the optimal location of the ecological corridor in conclusion this study provides insights into the implementation of an ecological corridor in the itapemirim river basin emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors and utilizing appropriate methodologies for effective decisionmaking in ecological planning,135
Effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tropical forestry,the production of organic wastes tends to increase in a manner that is proportional to human population growth currently applying these wastes to soils is being considered as an alternative solution for the over production of organic waste however the levels of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from organic waste applications in tropical forestry are unknown the aim of the present study was to quantify soil carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 emissions from a reforestation project where trees calophyllum brasiliense were fertilized with different mineral and organic waste materials a randomized trial was established to measure soil ghg emissions from plots fertilized with sewage sludge compost ssc sewage sludge ss mineral fertilizer min fert and a control c c brasiliense seedling spaced in 3 m x 2 m intervals were place into a planting hole which had fertilizer incorporated for seedling establishment soil ghg were measured using the static chamber method placing chambers on the surface of the soil and taking measurements over time during 172 days in a dry season organic wastes ss and ssc treatments had significantly higher soil co2 fluxes than mineral fertilizer and control plots with soil co2 fluxes of 635 117 and 933 096 g c m2 day1 respectively the application of organic wastes promoted a drastic increase in soil n2o emissions treated with ssc 14119 mg 21 n m2 day1 p 001 which had a higher emission factor 211 average soil ch4 flux on collection days was 01 02 mg c m2 day1 although cumulative soil ch4 emissions over the 5 months study period was positive for the ss treatment demonstrating the potential emission of ghg from this treatment apparently the variation in fluxes between treatments with organic residues was influenced by differences in the physical and chemical compositions of the wastes and the amounts of labile carbon added c 2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved,136
Time since fire as a driver of taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns of grassland plant communities,fire plays a key role in grasslands determining the distribution and evolution of species and boundaries with neighboring ecosystems evidence of communitywide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire tsf gradient we sampled 12 communities in southern brazil under varying tsf and calculated taxonomic species richness s and dominance d phylogenetic diversity pd and mean phylogenetic distances mpd we used structural equation models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors communities with longer tsf presented higher pd and mpd but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance these sites were dominated by monocots specifically c4 grasses but also presented exclusive clades whereas recentlyburned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical nonforest ecosystems from south america respond differently to fire possibly due to different evolutionary histories the authors 2024,137
Corn root and soil health indicator response to no-till production practices,crop production guidelines in brazil currently focus on soil fertility or chemical indicators ie soil ph and nutrient availability but often neglect physical and biological aspects of soil health notillage nt practices have been widely adopted in brazil primarily to mitigate erosion but chemicalbased guidelines associated with those practices may be contributing to nutrient stratification and a concentration of crop roots within the top few centimeters of the soil profile our objective was to quantify relationships between soil physical and chemical attributes and root growth in soils with a longterm nt history 10yr crop root development and several soil health indicators were measured within the 0 to 7 7 to 17 and 20 to 30cm depth increments of two longterm nt studies on rhodic hapludox soils in brazil data from both experiments showed strong organic carbon oc stratification significant differences in soil physical and chemical attributes and root systems that were concentrated within the surface layer soil compaction below 7cm appeared to be the dominant factor limiting root growth soiltest phosphorus p and oc were also correlated to root growth based on these analyses and other onfarm observations we concluded that it is important to recognize that despite its benefits nt practices can result in plant root stratification therefore it is important to not only monitor soil fertilitychemical conditions but also soil structure and biological indicators of soil health when developing nt guidelines for brazil,138
The diversity of post-fire regeneration strategies in the cerrado ground layer,disentangling species strategies that confer resilience to natural disturbances is key to conserving and restoring savanna ecosystems fire is a recurrent disturbance in savannas and savanna vegetation is highly adapted to and often dependent on fire however although the woody component of tropical savannas is well studied we still do not understand how groundlayer plant communities respond to fire limiting conservation and management actions we investigated the effects of prescribed fire on community structure and composition and evaluated which traits are involved in plant community regeneration after fire in the cerrado ground layer we assessed traits related to species persistence and colonization capacity after fire including resprouter type underground structure fireinduced flowering regeneration strategy and growth form we searched for functional groups related to response to fire to shed light on the main strategies of postfire recovery among species in the ground layer fire changed groundlayer community structure and composition in the short term leading to greater plant species richness population densities and increasing bare soil compared with unburned communities eight months after fire species abundance did not differ from predisturbance values for 86 of the species demonstrating the resilience of this layer to fire only one ruderal species was disadvantaged by fire and 13 of the species benefited rapid recovery of soil cover by native vegetation in burned areas was driven by species with high capacity to resprout and spread vegetatively recovery of the savanna groundlayer community as a whole resulted from a combination of different species traits we summarized these traits into five large groups encompassing key strategies involved in groundlayer regeneration after fire synthesis fire dramatically changes the ground layer of savanna vegetation in the short term but the system is highly resilient quickly recovering the prefire state recovery involves different strategies which we categorized into five functional groups of plant speciesgrassesseedersbloomersundergroundersandresprouters knowledge of these diverse strategies should be used as a tool to assess conservation and restoration status of fireresilient ecosystems in the cerrado,139
Floristic composition and edaphic relationships in ferruginous campo rupestre reference ecosystems,land use change and occupation have led to modifications in the environment causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the planet some environments with high economic relevance such as the ferruginous campo rupestre rupestrian grassland known as canga in brazil are even more susceptible to severe impacts due to their extreme habitat conditions and low resilience the determination of reference ecosystems based on the intrinsic characteristics of the ecosystem is essential for conservation as well as to the implementation of ecological restoration we proposed the reference ecosystem of the three main types of habitats of the ferruginous campo rupestre based on their floristic composition we described the floristic composition of each habitat and evaluated the physicochemical properties of the soils and the relationship between plants and soils all three habitats showed high diversity of plant species and many endemic species such as chamaecrista choriophylla cuphea pseudovaccinium lychnophora pinaster and vellozia subalata the distribution of vegetation was strongly related with the edaphic characteristics with a set of species more adapted to high concentration of base saturation fine sand organic carbon and iron while another set of species succeeded in more acidic soils with higher s and silt concentration we provide support for the contention that the ferruginous campo rupestre is a mosaic of different habitats shaped by intrinsic local conditions failure to recognize the floristic composition of each particular habitat can lead to inappropriate restoration increased habitat homogenization and increased loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services this study also advances the knowledge base for building the reference ecosystem for the different types of ferruginous campo rupestre habitats as well as a key database for highlighting those species contribute most to community assembly in this diverse and threatened tropical mountain ecosystem science press institute of mountain hazards and environment cas and springerverlag gmbh germany part of springer nature 2024,140
Management Recommendation Generation for Areas Under Forest Restoration Process through Images Obtained by UAV and LiDAR,evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management however the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult the use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas the objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration which were monitored by two different remote sensors uav unmanned aerial vehicle and lidar light detection and ranging the study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation owned by fibria celulose sa recently acquired by suzano sa in the southern region of bahia state brazil we used images from canon s110 nir green red near infrared on uav and lidar data compositions intensity image digital surface model digital terrain model normalized digital surface model the monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes canopy cover bare soil and grass cover the images were classified using the random forest rf and maximum likelihood ml algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated an expert system was developed in arcgis to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images there was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers the most frequent management recommendation was weed control plant seedlings 34 for all evaluated methods the image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations 2019 by the authors,141

Comparing the potential reproductive phenology between restored areas and native tropical forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil,plant phenology is rarely considered when selecting species used in restoration actions however considering the potential flowering and fruiting phenologies of species is a key point to 1 evaluate the capacity of restoration actions in reestablishing ecological interactions pollination and seed dispersal and ecosystem functions early germination and plant establishment to reduce soil erosion 2 determine which species are most suitable to the target site and 3 identify when and where locally adapted seeds can be harvested and purchased here we evaluate the potential reproductive phenology of species occurring in restored and forest fragments in southeastern brazil we asked whether flowering and fruiting phenological patterns differed among type areas for such we compared 14 restored areas and 18 nearby forest fragments and compiled phenological data from the literature for 267 species 84 of species sampled despite their low floristic similarity restored and forest fragments showed close similarity of general potential flowering and fruiting periods yearround peaking in the drytorainy season there were only slight differences in seasonality of two out of the eight parameters evaluated nonzoochorous species fruiting was seasonal while zoochorous species fruiting onset occurred yearround but was slightly seasonal in forest fragments comparing potential phenological patterns between restored and forest fragments using a compilation from secondary sources are unprecedented in brazil at this scale our results highlight that applying phenological information even from literature is essential to improve the science and practice of future restoration actions enhancing the likelihood of successful restoration of ecosystem functions and species interactions,143
Regeneration after fire in campo rupestre: Short- and long-term vegetation dynamics,the cerrado brazilian savanna is the second largest biome in brazil covering 22 of the country and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems composed of a mosaic of herbaceous shrubland and savanna vegetation generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow acidic and nutrientpoor soils in the context of increased landuse changes effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short and longterm in the main herbaceous vegetation types the sandy and stony grasslands we monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short term vegetation recovery diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the longterm vegetation dynamics our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities we did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands no change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem after fire biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types high biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity c 2017 elsevier gmbh all rights reserved,144
Ghg mitigation potential and cost in tropical forestry - Relative role for agroforestry,this paper summarizes studies of carbon mitigation potential mp and costs of forestry options in seven developing countries with a focus on the role of agroforestry a common methodological approach known as comprehensive mitigation assessment process comap was used in each study to estimate the potential and costs between 2000 and 2030 the approach requires the projection of baseline and mitigation landuse scenarios derived from the demand for forest products and forestland for other uses such as agriculture and pasture by using data on estimated carbon sequestration emission avoidance costs and benefits the model enables one to estimate cost effectiveness indicators based on monetary benefit pert c as well as estimates of total mitigation costs and potential when the activities are implemented at equilibrium level the results show that about half the mp of 69 gt c an average of 223 mt c per year between 2000 and 2030 in the seven countries could be achieved at a negative cost and the other half at costs not exceeding dollar sign100 pert c negative cost indicates that noncarbon revenue is sufficient to offset direct costs of about half of the options the agroforestry options analyzed bear a significant proportion of the potential at medium to low cost pert c when compared to other options the role of agroforestry in these countries varied between 6 and 21 of the mp though the options are much more cost effective than most due to the low wage or opportunity cost of rural labor agroforestry options are attractive due to the large number of people and potential area currently engaged in agriculture but they pose unique challenges for carbon and cost accounting due to the dispersed nature of agricultural activities in the tropics as well as specific difficulties arising from requirements for monitoring verification leakage assessment and the establishment of credible baselines,145
Surface runoff in six years of rehabilitation of two areas after bauxite mining in Southeastern Brazil,the analysis of surface runoff premining and during six years of rehabilitation with eucalyptus plantation postmining in bauxite mining areas was the central objective of this work surface runoff was monitored from january to may before mining and in the same months from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation being collected in seven plots in two bauxite mining areas in southeastern brazil the factors that interfere with runoff were characterized in all periods statistically compared by the wilcoxon test and submitted to principal component analysis pca the total surface runoff in the five months before mining was 174 to 1406 times greater than the runoff in the same months in the six years of rehabilitation the average percentage runoff was 1 of the precipitation in all rehabilitation periods in contrast before mining 13 of the precipitation of 556 mm became surface runoff the highest slopes of the regression were for the first year of rehabilitation and for the premining period showing a greater influence of precipitation on the generation of surface runoff soil litter and vegetation characteristics were the most explanatory factors in the sixyear pca specific factors must be viewed with caution on micro scale in each year of rehabilitation of surface bauxite mines due to soil heterogeneity and consequent vegetation seeking to minimize the negative effects on surface runoff gap in knowledge about surface runoff percentages in six years of rehabilitation in brazil and tropical areas was filled mine managers can more clearly define the priority factors in strategies to mitigate the effects of mining on the environment from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation in surface mined areas,146
Measuring and modeling nitrous oxide and methane emissions from beef cattle feedlot manure management: First assessments under Brazilian condition,intensive beef production has increased during recent decades in brazil and may substantially increase both methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from manure management however the quantification of these gases and methods for extrapolating them are scarce in brazil a case study examines ch4 and n2o emissions from one typical beef cattle feedlot manure management continuum in brazil and the applicability of manuredndc model in predicting these emissions for better understand fluxes and mitigation options measurements track ch4 and n2o emissions from manure excreted in one housing floor holding 21 animals for 78days stockpiled for 73days and field spread 360kg n ha1 we found total emissions ch4 n2o of 019 010kg co2eq per kg of animal live weight gain mostly coming from field application 73 followed housing 25 and storage 2 the manuredndc simulations were generally within the statistical deviation ranges of the field data differing in 28 in total emission large uncertainties in measurements showed the model was more accurate estimating the magnitude of gases emissions than replicate results at daily basis modeled results suggested increasing the frequency of manure removal from housing splitting the field application and adopting notillage system is the most efficient management for reducing emissions from manure up to about 75 since this work consists in the first assessment under brazilian conditions more and continuous field measurements are required for decreasing uncertainties and improving model validations however this paper reports promising results and scientific perceptions for the design of further integrated work on farmscale measurements and manuredndc model development for brazilian conditions,147

A biomass map of the Brazilian Amazon from multisource remote sensing,the amazon forest the largest contiguous tropical forest in the world stores a significant fraction of the carbon on land changes in climate and land use affect total carbon stocks making it critical to continuously update and revise the best estimates for the region particularly considering changes in forest dynamics forest inventory data cover only a tiny fraction of the amazon region and the coverage is not sufficient to ensure reliable data interpolation and validation this paper presents a new forest aboveground biomass map for the brazilian amazon and the associated uncertainty both with a resolution of 250 meters and baseline for the satellite dataset the year of 2016 ie the year of the satellite observation a significant increase in data availability from forest inventories and remote sensing has enabled progress towards highresolution biomass estimates this work uses the largest airborne lidar database ever collected in the amazon mapping 360000 km2 through transects distributed in all vegetation categories in the region the map uses airborne laser scanning als data calibrated by field forest inventories that are extrapolated to the region using a machine learning approach with inputs from synthetic aperture radar palsar vegetation indices obtained from the moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite and precipitation information from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a total of 174 field inventories geolocated using a differential global positioning system dgps were used to validate the biomass estimations the experimental design allowed for a comprehensive representation of several vegetation types producing an aboveground biomass map varying from a maximum value of 518 mg ha1 a mean of 174 mg ha1 and a standard deviation of 102 mg ha1 this unique dataset enabled a better representation of the regional distribution of the forest biomass and structure providing further studies and critical information for decisionmaking concerning forest conservation planning carbon emissions estimate and mechanisms for supporting carbon emissions reductions,152
Phylogenetic distance controls plant growth during early restoration of a semi-arid riparian forest,little attention has been paid to phylogenetic diversity during restoration initiatives because plant phylogenetic distance can be a surrogate for functional diversity its consideration could foster the restoration of degraded areas this study investigates the influence of species richness and phylogenetic relatedness during early restoration of a riparian forest located between the atlantic forest and semiarid ecosystems in ne brazil the restoration experiment was established along a perennial stream in monte alegre rn investigating the significance of species richness and phylogenetic diversity for sapling survival and growth of the restored communities we used phylogenetic information on 47 tree species naturally occurring at the study site the resulting phylogenetic tree had a basal node with three major clades to implement the experiment three species from each clade were randomly selected resulting in nine species from five families we defined five levels of diversity i no planting ii monoculture iii three phylogenetically related species same clade iv three phylogenetically distant species different clades and v nine species the experiment consisted of 96 12 m x 10 m plots established along the two margins of the stream overall 1656 saplings 2050 cm were planted in september 2015 184 per species we tested whether the survival and growth of saplings are influenced by the number of species planted and phylogenetic distance among them we assessed plant mortality and growth during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 survival was lower but relative growth was higher for plants near the stream after controlling for differences in initial size plots with phylogenetically distant species produced significantly taller plants but only when occurring near the stream diversity treatments did not influence plant survival while initial size determined plant survival and growth our findings show that greater phylogenetic distance led to increased plant growth probably because of the presence of functionally divergent species that use resources in a complementary way therefore plant phylogenetic relatedness should be considered during the design of restored communities to improve the outcomes of future restoration initiatives,153
Quick qualitative and quantitative changes in reproductive efforts in an open cerrado community: An explorative study of fire-stimulated species,cerrado is a tropical savanna hotspot that is impacted by frequent wildfires but where many effects of fire still are poorly understood this is especially true for the herbaceous strata at the community level in which reproductive efforts are deeply affected by fire the objectives of this study were the following evaluate if fire qualitatively andor quantitatively affects the production of sexual reproductive structures in an open cerrado community describe firestimulated or fireinhibited flowering and fruiting species and evaluate the influence of water availability on flowering and fruiting the number of species with flowers and fruitsm2 and the number of reproductive unitsm2 were sampled in eight 20x20 m2 plots in chapada diamantina brazil after the first sampling in the beginning of the rainy season november 2009 the vegetation in four plots was burned and then the eight plots were resampled over five months indexes of firestimulated and fireinhibited flowering and fruiting species were calculated nonmetric multidimensional scaling and crosscorrelation analyses were calculated and differences between the burnt and unburnt plots were compared with an analysis of variance sexual reproduction was deeply affected by fire which changed the composition of reproducing species profuse reproduction of graminoids poaceae and geophytic herbs classified as firestimulated flowering andor firestimulated fruiting species concomitantly occurred with a high increase of water in the burnt soil compared to the unburnt soil in the first two months after the fires the sexual reproduction of shrubby species was inhibited by fire in an objective way 21 species stimulated or inhibited by fire were recorded fire also changed the influence of rainfall on reproductive efforts this study shows quick qualitative and quantitative effects of fire on open cerrado functioning and highlights the necessity of fire management for biodiversity conservation in savannas,154
Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil,the zero tillage zt system is used in a large area 24 mha of crop production in brazil this management system can contribute to soil c sequestration but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under zt compared to conventional tillage ct which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits the aim of this study was to estimate the emission of n2o from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18yearold experiment conducted on a rhodic ferralsol in the south of brazil fluxes of n2o were measured over two years using staticclosed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations soil water filled pore space wfps and soil mineral n were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature estimates of n2o emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the ipcc direct emission factor ef1 1 to the amounts of n added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues fluxes of n2o were relatively low apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements no relationship between n2o fluxes and wfps or mineral n were observed nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation for the crop rotation receiving high rates of n fertiliser in the second year fieldmeasured n2o emissions were significantly underestimated by the ipcc emission factor 1 ef1 for the other treatments measured n2o emissions fell within the ef1 uncertainty range but always considerably lower than the ef1 estimate which suggests ipcc ef1 overestimates true n2o emissions for the ferralsol under evaluation,155

Measures for sustainable forest management in the tropics - A tree-ring based case study on tree growth and forest dynamics in a Central Amazonian lowland moist forest,the conservation of tropical forests is recognized as one of the most important challenges for forestry ecology and politics besides strict protection the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries for tree ring analysis stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species cariniana micrantha caryocar villosum and manilkara huberi in the upland terra firme forests of the precious woods amazon logging company near itacoatiara brazil based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter height and volume growth the age of the eldest tree a c micrantha was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter the species diameter increments range from 020012 cm yr1 to 029008 cm yr1 at first sight this is considerably lower than increments reported from other amazonian or african timber species considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents the interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the brazilian standards fixed by laws felling cycle of 2535 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm felling cycles should be increased to 3251 years and minimum logging diameters to 63123 cm depending on the species 2019 worbes schngart this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited,157
The importance of conspecific facilitation during recruitment and regeneration: A case study in degraded mangroves,facilitation can affect positively the survival growth and fitness of neighboring plants and is able to promote the establishment of plant species under harsh environmental conditions this study is one of the few to focus on conspecific nurse plants enabling the establishment of tree followers and the generally unknown interplay between facilitation and competition during recruitment and establishmentfield studies were conducted in an hypersaline area in north brazil where the hydrological regime was disturbed by road construction in 1974 avicennia germinans shrubs were able to recolonize subareasthree different stages of recolonization were identified by satellite imagery based on the vegetation coverage and were defined as the early middle and late stages different plant parameters including height and crown radius of individual trees were measured and all plants separating mangrove seedlings and larger plants were stemmappedthe hegyi index was adapted to measure local interaction intensity considering both positive facilitation and negative competition interactions among neighboring plants spatial point pattern analyses were combined with the interaction index to obtain a better overview of the strength and importance of the plant interactions within the different recolonizing stagesthe spatial patterns displayed aggregation for all plants in all developmental stages this is supported by the interaction index calculated for seedlings the index however provides an early signal for the switching of plant interactions from facilitation to competition as the developmental stage increased this feature remains undetected in the spatial patterns because selfthinning processes are linked to individual growth processes and require more time to take placethis study broadens the ecological concept of nurse plants from hetero to conspecific including the importance and strength of plant interactions the studied degraded areas are recolonizing naturally and conclusions can be drawn for restoration projects which usually do not take facilitation effects into account c 2014 gesellschaft fur okologie published by elsevier gmbh all rights reserved,158
"Weed control, large seeds and deep roots: Drivers of success in direct seeding for savanna restoration",aim we aimed to evaluate the performance of native tree species in the restoration of savanna vegetation by direct seeding to assess whether weed control and intercropping with native grasses can contribute to the success of this method and to determine whether species performance can be explained by functional traits location cerrado biome southeastern brazil old fields abandoned after decades of land use as pasture or croplands occupied by ruderal plants and invasive grasses methods we established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species native to the cerrado brazilian savanna region we used a factorial design in five blocks with the following factors a species b weed control and c intercropping with native grasses we evaluated the emergence survival and growth of plants and through multiple regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct seeding based on their functional traits results emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species but with little or no difference between treatments growth was compromised by weed competition in all species intercropping with native grasses did not decrease weed competition we found a functional pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding where survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass root depth and a greater rootshoot ratio conclusion weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding the success of this method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root system characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding 2020 international association for vegetation science,159
Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Heterogeneity by Logging Intensity in a Federal Concession Area in the Brazilian Amazon,the logging intensity often does not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the forest volume of commercial native species in the brazilian amazon this study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity distribution by assessing logging intensity and its effects on the volumetric stock and abundance of commercial species with a focus on sustainable management practices this study was conducted in the saractaquera national forest in the brazilian amazon forest inventory data elevation and planetscope satellite images were integrated into a geographic information system the information was aggregated into regular 1hectare cells for the times before during and after logging t0 t1 and t2 the unsupervised classification algorithm kmeans with four clusters was used to analyze heterogeneity before logging areas with higher commercial volumes were distant from water bodies while areas with lower elevation had lower wood stocks logging intensity was generally low concentrating on a few trees per hectare logging in the study area revealed a heterogeneous spatial distribution by intensifying in areas with the highest wood stocks these results suggest that in addition to the recommended logging intensity according to legislation forest heterogeneity should be considered by the manager promoting adaptive strategies to ensure the conservation of forest resources 2024 by the authors,160

Land degradation affects the microbial communities in the Brazilian Caatinga biome,considering that global land degradation and desertification are increasing nowadays understanding how soil microbial communities are modulated by these drivers is of paramount importance to mitigate these processes here we assessed the effect of land degradation restoration and native forest on soil microbial communities in a semiarid region from northeastern brazil thus soil samples were collected at 020 cm depth in three sites native degraded and restored lands the soil dna was extracted and the microbial community was assessed by nextgeneration sequencing through the illumina platform the composition of microbial communities and their potential functions were altered by the degradation process thereby decreasing microbial diversity also the changes in the microbial communities seem to be related to soil chemical alterations which were changed by the process of degradation and restoration land degradation led to a loss of diversity and functions and the restored area presented more resilience which suggests that the microbial communities could recover their functions by adopting sustainable practices importantly degraded lands reduced functions related to chemoheterotrophic metabolism which can strongly impact carbon dynamics in the system finally this study provided relevant evidence that land restoration practices can recover soil functions which is extremely relevant for further research that is aimed at the development of sustainable practices in degradation hotspots around the world,162
The inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soil amended with swine slurry,purpose this study was carried out to evaluate the effects of the tillage system and consecutive application of swine slurry for seven years on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and infective propagules in brazilian soil with crop rotation method the spore density the external mycelium and the most probable number of infective propagules of mycorrhizal fungal abundance were assessed in soil samples from an oxisol in a longterm field experiment in response to soil management notillage and conventional tillage and following successive application of swine slurry 0 30 60 90 and results a greater amount of external mycelium was observed in soil under notillage while mycorrhizal fungal abundance spore density was greater in soil under conventional tillage in soil under notillage mycorrhizal fungal abundance infective propagules were more abundant however in soil with both management systems this variable was reduced with different levels of swine slurry application in notillage the main source of mycorrhizal fungal abundance propagules is the external mycelium while in conventional tillage the main inoculum component is the spores conclusion in this study we verified that the application of swine slurry with high phosphorus contents reduces arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi propagules however these effects are mitigated in notillage systems compared to conventional tillage,163
Reproductive phenology of critical native plant species for mineland restoration in the eastern Amazon,amazon ironstone outcrops vegetation or canga is a remarkable environment in which the plants are adapted to peculiar circumstances knowledge regarding different aspects of this ecosystem remains modest including necessary insights for its conservation and recovery such as the reproductive phenology of priority species that form the plant community this study aimed to monitor the reproductive phenology of critical native species that are categorized as rare endemic andor threatened in the canga of the amazon rainforest in para brazil during february 2016 and may 2017 eleven species were evaluated regarding the presence or absence of flowering and fruiting phenophases and these were associated with environmental variables phenological data were evaluated through circular statistical analysis all studied species flowered and produced fruit during the monitoring period the evaluated species have an annual reproductive cycle marked by seasonality and flowering peaks between march and april during the wet season and fruiting peaks during may at the beginning of the dry season the best period for collecting ripe seeds a primary tool for the restoration of degraded areas is june water availability may be essential for the establishment of annual plants and to induce flowering in both annual and perennial species the reproductive phenophases of the studied species are concentrated within a short period and are synchronized which may increase the possibility of crosspollination and minimize flower and seed predation we discuss the challenges in including annual plants and the importance of having them and perennial species in conservation and restoration of degraded areas projects,164
Early Response of Tree Seed Arrival After Liana Cutting in a Disturbed Tropical Forest,most remaining tropical forests are under some level of chronic human disturbance which may favor the proliferation of disturbanceadapted native plants like some species of tropical lianas these plants may alter forest structure and composition but little is known about their effect on ecological processes such as seed rain we analyzed the early effects of overabundant lianas on the seed rain of animaldispersed tree species for 1 year we analyzed the effect of overabundant lianas on seed rain by cutting all lianas in experimental plots of 3141 m2 establishing 12 paired plots with and without liana cutting in a disturbed atlantic forest remnant in southeastern brazil rarefied tree seed species richness was higher in plots dominated by lianas 109 02 and 83 12 for 500 seeds sampled in lianadominated and lianacut plots respectively but seed abundance was lower 209 138 and 984 421 seeds m2 in lianadominated and lianacut plots respectively pioneer seed abundance 3160 1163 seeds m2 and species density 32 03 species trap1 did not differ among treatments lianas may eventually increase local seed rain diversity while suppressing local tree seed rain abundance understanding the impact of the dominance of ruderal species in ecological processes that maintain tropical forests communities such as seed rain is crucial to guide the directions for conservation and management of degraded remnants,165
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities shaped by host-plant affect the outcome of plant-soil feedback in dryland restoration,plant inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can be a useful tool to overcome challenges in dry forest restoration however advances are still needed to guide choices regarding soil origin and inoculum production methods since outcomes can vary due to plantsoil feedbacks psf we evaluate how soil origin and host plant used for inoculum production affect amf community and therefore the plant biomass accumulation and functional traits in the conditioning phase we investigated whether soils originating from a recovered area quarry and a vegetation fragment caatinga would have their amf communities modified due to the growth of sorghum bicolor used for inoculum production and senna uniflora used in brazilian semiarid restoration in the feedback phase we compared the performance of four plants species growing on a degraded soil and inoculated or not by a mixture of amf isolates in comparison to soil inoculum prepared from the conditioning phase the inoculum from caatinga presented seven times more amf species compared to that from the quarry which presented ruderal and stress tolerant species the soil inoculum conditioned by s uniflora regardless of origin presented greater evenness compared to the soil inoculum produced with s bicolor and promoted 33 more plant biomass compared to the control without inoculation root colonization by amf increased psf and decreased plant investment in functional traits such as specific root length srl and specific leaf area sla our results demonstrate the importance of adopting strategies that preserve local adaptation of inoculants produced the use of native plant for propagation of native amf in the conditioning phase provided more positive responses for mesosphaerum suaveolens and rhaphiodon echinus than inoculated with introduced amf isolates this is probably due to the interaction of inoculated plants with responsive amf present in the soil synthesis and applications our study shows that conditioning fieldcollected soil with senna uniflora and using it for inoculation can be a simple technique to promote biomass accumulation for other native herbaceous species this preserves the compatibility between the soil inoculum produced with native amf and native plants representing an important tool for restoration programs,166

Deep soil tillage in the coffee planting furrow has long-lasting benefits for improving soil physical quality and enhancing plant vigor in dense soils,the deep furrows and additional liming can improve soil quality and reduce drought impact during coffee plant establishment especially in dense soils however the effects of the initial preparer in the medium to long term are scarce this study aims to assess the fiveyear impact of different deep tillage strategies and chemical fertility improvement of the planting furrow on soil physical quality and plant growth under cambisol with coffee cultivation the experiment was conducted in a cambisol in nazareno minas gerais state brazil the experiment followed a randomized complete block design with a splitplot arrangement in space including three blocks six soil depths 0005 015020 035040 055060 060070 and 075080 m and five soil preparation methods sp40 furrower at 040 m with conventional fertilization sp60 rotary hoe at 060 m with additional liming sp60al sp80 soil homogenizer at 060 m and subsoiler at 080 m with additional liming sp80al these soil preparations were compared with a native savannah vegetation area from the cerrado biome natural undisturbed samples were collected at different depths five years after the initial soil preparation in these samples physical quality indicators were investigated along with the correlation of plant measurements stem diameter sd plant height ph and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi analysis of variance and the scottknott and dunnett tests p 005 were applied to analyze the data after five years of soil preparation improvements up to 040 m depth were due to soil homogenization subsoiling and liming reducing bulk density and enhancing water retention additional limestone between 020 and 060 m depth improved sd ph and ndvi mitigating drought however initial soil preparation induced compaction at 060070 m depth with subsoiler effects disappearing at 080 m effective deep tillage improves soil quality but requires careful planning,203
C-offset and crop energy efficiency increase due industrial poultry waste use in long-term no-till soil minimizing environmental pollution,brazil is one of the major global poultry producers and the organic waste generated by the chicken slaughterhouses can potentially be used as a biofertilizer in agriculture this study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous use of biofertilizer to the crops substituting the use of mineral fertilizer promote coffset for the soil and generate crop energy efficiency for the production system thus the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of biofertilizer use alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer on soil organic carbon soc stock carbon dioxide co2 mitigation coffset crop energy efficiency and productivity and alleviation of environmental pollution the experiment was established in southern brazil on a soil under 15 years of continuous notill nt experimental treatments were as follows i control with no fertilizer application ii 100 use of industrial mineral fertilizer minf iii 100 use of organic waste originated from poultry slaughterhouses and hereinafter designated biofertilizer biof and iv mixed fertilizer equivalent to the use of 50 mineral fertilizer 50 of biofertilizer mixf effects of experimental treatments were assessed for the crop sequence based on bean phaseolus vulgaris soybean glycine max and corn zea mays in the summer and wheat triticum aestivum and black oat avena strigosaschreb in the winter composing two crops per year as follow beanwheatsoybeanblack oatcornwheatsoybeanblack oatcornwheatbean the continuous use of biof treatment significantly increased the index of crop energy efficiency it was higher than that of control and increased it by 254 mg co2eq ha1 over that of minf treatment because of higher inputs of crop biomassc into the system further continuous use of biof resulted in a significantly higher co2eq stock and offset than those for minf treatment a positive relationship between the coffset and the crop energy efficiency r2 071 p 0001 indicated that the increase of coffset was associated with the increase of energy balance and the amount of soc sequestered the higher energy efficiency and coffset by application of biof indicated that the practice of crop bio fertilization with poultry slaughterhouse waste is a viable alternative for recycling and minimizing the environmental impacts c 2021 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,204
Livestock intensification and environmental sustainability: An analysis based on pasture management scenarios in the brazilian savanna,brazils major beef production occurs in the cerrado predominantly as extensive pastures that covers similar to 50 mha of the biome of which approximately 23 show signs of degradation pasture recovery is now a key environmental policy as it improves land use efficiency and soil carbon sequestration however as intensification leads to higher cattle stocking rates and external inputs fertilizers liming etc the impact of improved pastures on greenhouse gas mitigation is still debatable this study focused on the cerrado biome and aimed to i quantify soil carbon stock changes under different scenarios of management and recovery of degraded pastures in addition ii the potential for capturing carbon in the soil to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases ghg by the intensification of pastures was evaluated soil c stock changes 020 cm were assessed using the century model version 45 which had been previously validated for the region model parameters were adjusted for three pastures classes degraded intermediately degraded and not degraded within a timeseries 19852020 of land use maps for the cerrado serving as baselines scenarios of pasture intensification were modeled against these baselines and an analysis was carried out on the estimated changes in soil c stock and greenhouse gas balance before the intensification scenario year 2020 the total carbon stock was estimated to be similar to 1830 mt for the whole pasture area whose spatial distribution corresponded to edaphoclimatic contrasts and pasture conditions the highest soil organic carbon stocks were observed in the nondegraded pastures with the increase in carrying capacity beef production is estimated to potentially increase by 13 due to the recovery of degraded areas through intensive management this increase would be sufficient to meet the projected similar to 12 increase in brazils livestock production by the end of the decade if all pasture areas are restored which is much possibly an unrealistic scenario as not all degraded areas are suitable for crops or can successfully improve pasture yield in addition the increase in soil c stocks was only sufficient to compensate for 27 and 42 of the ghg emissions resulting from intensification in areas with intermediate and severe degradation respectively therefore to strike a balance between economic considerations and environmental impact additional strategies are needed to reduce ghg emissions andor enhance c sinks such as increasing tree density on farms from this perspective implementing livestock intensification at the landscape scale can promote c stocks and the diversity of ecosystem services opening the possibility of ecosystem restoration,205
Assessment of rehabilitation projects results of a gold mine area using landscape function analysis,mining activity is indispensable for the current stage of progress of our civilization although it is a temporary activity its impacts are remarkable especially with respect to landscape modifications to mitigate such impacts the implementation of monitored environmental recovery projects is of fundamental importance landscape function analysis lfa is a multicriteria analysis using remote sensing data and field information suitable for monitoring the performance of recovery projects in areas degraded by the mining activity in this work lfa was used to evaluate the results of 20 years of environmental recovery projects in a gold mine ten base maps were developed declivity vegetationphysiognomy stratification fractures and faults compaction degreesoil structure erosion features geotechnical stability local hydrogeology degree of fragment isolation soils and drainage these were combined in order to give rise to three intermediate maps erosion and soil stability vegetation and water with the union of these three maps it was possible to create the map with the final analysis of the environmental recovery performance the technique used allowed the separation of native areas which obtained the highest scores recovered and selfsustaining areas old mine dumps and waste piles and areas still deficient in environmental recovery with stability and erosion problems mining sites and active mine dumps in addition to allowing the analysis of large areas the presentation of lfa results on maps facilitates decisionmaking and the dissemination and understanding of results by the different stakeholders involved,206

Potential of rheometry in detecting cohesive soils in Brazil as an additional tool to morphological field description and tensile resistance quantification,although an experienced pedologist quickly identifies soils with a cohesive character similar to hardsetting soils directly in the field advances in its correct diagnosis are needed since the description requires wet and dry soil situations and relies upon qualitative aspects taxonomic systems usually consider metrics for other diagnostic attributes clay fraction activity abrupt textural change etc but not for the cohesive character although the latter is environmentally important and is referred to in soil taxonomy systems research is especially required at the microscale where adhesive and cohesive forces are manifested as particle interactions the aim of this study was to determine whether rheological properties obtained in amplitude sweep tests can serve as indicators of hardsetting or cohesive soils to improve the understanding of underlying processes in such soils we analyzed soil samples from horizons identified as either cohesive or noncohesive from six brazilian soils typic paleudalf ultic hapludalf typic hapludalf typic paleustult kandiudox and hapludox separated by depth in top middle and bottom layers as rheological properties we determined strain at the end of the linear viscoelastic range lvr gamma lvr shear stress at the end of the lvr tau lvr strain at the yield point yp gamma yp storage and loss modulus at the yp g g yp maximum shear stress tau max strain at the maximum shear stress gamma tau max and integral z iz cohesion only affected gamma lvr in the base position and had a significant effect on tau max and gamma tau max in the top and middle positions respectively three soil materials did not reach the yield point the iz was either higher or lower in cohesive soils compared to noncohesive soils where the iz was higher in noncohesive soils this seems to be linked to a small dilatancy as a consequence of the high friction between soil particles also tau max and iz showed significant interactions of soil type and cohesion by means of a twoway anova soil type had a greater effect on rheological properties and the typic paleudalf had generally higher values parallely determined iron organic carbon and clay contents bulk density and normal force at the beginning of the test had the greatest impact on rheology tensile strength a property evaluated on the mesoscale had the closest relationship with gamma tau max and tau max in conclusion rheometry can support common analyses to identify the cohesive character however for an independent evaluation based upon most sensitive rheological attributes further testing is needed with a greater diversity of soils and at different water contents the possibility to promptly identify cohesive character by quantitative means is essential for effective measures for the mitigation of the mechanical impediments of cohesive soils for agriculture with the existence of a single parameter to distinguish cohesiveness and its magnitude different soil management strategies can be easily tested and compared to obtain greater soil workability and therefore improved fertility,210
Evaluation of physiological traits in upland rice for adaptation to no-tillage system,in the cerrado region of brazil notillage is an alternative management practice to conserve soil and reduce cost of crop production however many studies have been showed that there is a decrease in the yield when upland rice is cropped in this system therefore there is a need that new breeding initiatives introgress favorable traits into upland rice for notillage adaptation key traits include faster emergence ability to germinate when deep seeded faster root development and early canopy closure during the vegetative stages all those traits can be summarized as early vigor so the objective of this study was to evaluate physiological traits of four contrasting parental upland lice cultivars to verify their adaptation to notillage system a greenhouse experiment with four upland rice cultivars brs primavera brs curinga brs soberana and douradao were planted at three different dates and growth at potential conditions development stages total dry matter leaf area leaf dry matter leaf length leaf elongation rate and leaf duration were measured and calculated based on physiological traits the four cultivars showed differences in the growth cycle however for biomass and leaf area growth and leaf expansion traits they did not differ significantly probably being the lack of genetic early vigor a characteristic of the modern cultivars the growth and development pattern was significantly affected by planting dates and not by cultivars,211

Simulating plant productivity under different organic fertilization practices in a maize/native pasture rotation system in semi-arid NE Brazil,subsistence agriculture systems in semiarid regions need to adapt management to rainfall variability within the constraints of lowcost alternatives organic fertilization is generally the best possible option to maintain soil fertility as the use of chemical fertilizers is unfeasible due to the high cost and risks of drought and crop failure however the effectiveness of organic fertilization will vary according to the quality and rate of organic fertilizer application rainfall scenarios and decomposition patterns simulation models can be used for a quick evaluation of management strategies in many possible scenarios in this paper a newly developed model salsa semiarid latinamerica simulation model for agroecosystems was used to simulate along a 3year period plant productivity and soil fertility in a maizenative pasture rotation system in semiarid ne brazil the model simulated reasonably well the observed maize productivity in the experimental plots during the 3 years of the study even under contrasting rainfall conditions and application of organic fertilizers of different qualities animal manure or gliricidia sepium prunings however model simulations of native pasture biomass productivity did not adequately represent seasonal and fertilizer responses in part probably due to the seasonal variability of the pasture species composition the model showed that the effectiveness of organic fertilization depended upon rainfall with largest response in years with intermediate precipitation and lower responses in wet and dry years high nitrogen leaching and cloudiness reduced fertilizer use efficiency in wet years even at high rates of fertilizer application 20 t ha1 fertilization with g sepium did not increase aboveground maize productivity compared with animal manure even though it contained twice the amount of labile fraction this lack of crop responses to a more labile fertilizer is explained by the large fraction of nitrogen that is leached to deep soil which reduced nitrogen availability in the volume of the soil with the largest amount of crop roots management strategies that reduce nitrogen leaching or favor pumping nitrogen from deeper layers agroforestry would benefit productivity in this system the salsa model proved to have potential as a useful tool to help decisions needed to increase organic fertilization efficiency in ne brazil even though the base information is scarce compared with modern agriculture c 2008 elsevier bv all rights reserved,241
Environmental filtering of agroforestry systems reduces the risk of biological invasion,prevention is the most effective way of mitigating the negative impacts of exotic species invasions on biodiversity preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species we expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance if ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity supporting the coexistence of closely related species here we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures we sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the araponga municipality brazil and measured understory light availability phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index nri and the nearest taxon index nti understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems of the 48 species found 25 occurred in agroforestry systems three of which were exotics fortytwo species were found in monoculture stands including 13 exotics as expected nri and nti indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species filtering them from the understory the mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown however shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix therefore agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems 2014 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht,242

"Termite assemblage collapse along a land-use intensification gradient in lowland central Sumatra, Indonesia",1 termites are major decomposers in tropical regions and play an important role in soil processes this study measured the impact of landuse intensification on the termite assemblage of lowland rain forest in jambi province on the indonesian island of sumatra termite composition was assessed in seven landuse types along a disturbance gradient from primary forest through different silvicultural systems to grassland and cultivated land without trees a range of environmental variables was also measured2 termite species richness and relative abundance declined as follows primary forest selectively logged forest mature jungle rubber a diverse agroforest dominated by rubber trees mature rubber plantation young paraserianthes falcataria plantation a softwood tree imperata cylindrica grassland cassava garden termite richness fell from 34 species in the primary forest to one species in the cassava garden the relative abundance of soilfeeding termites showed a significantly greater decline along the gradient than did woodfeeding termites3 of the environmental variables woody plant basal area was most strongly correlated with termite species richness r 0973 and relative abundance r 0980 this reflects the response of forestadapted termites to progressive simplification of the physical structure of the habitat resulting in the reduction of canopy cover and alteration in microclimate and the loss of feeding and nesting sites4 synthesis and applications comparisons with other studies show that the decline in termite species richness and relative abundance seen at jambi is a general trend that occurs elsewhere when forests are converted to other land uses to help mitigate the loss of termites when forests are disturbed we recommend the following management practices the use of reducedimpact logging techniques maximizing forest patch size and connectivity minimizing length of forest edges and leaving dead wood to decay in situ,250
Potential of agroforestry for carbon sequestration and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from soils in the tropics,losses of carbon c stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are challenges that scientists and policy makers have been facing in the recent past intensified agricultural practices lead to a reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks mainly due to removal of aboveground biomass as harvest and loss of carbon as co2 through burning andor decomposition evidence is emerging that agroforestry systems are promising management practices to increase aboveground and soil c stocks and reduce soil degradation as well as to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the humid tropics the potential of agroforestry treebased systems to sequester c in vegetation can be over 70 mg c ha1 and up to 25 mg ha1 in the top 20 cm of soil in degraded soils of the subhumid tropics improved fallow agroforestry practices have been found to increase top soil c stocks up to 16 mg c ha1 y1 above continuous maize cropping soil c accretion is linked to the structural development of the soil in particular to increasing c in water stable aggregates wsa a review of agroforestry practices in the humid tropics showed that these systems were able to mitigate n2o and co2 emissions from soils and increase the ch4 sink strength compared to cropping systems the increase in n2o and co2 emissions after addition of legume residues in improved fallow systems in the subhumid tropics indicates the importance of using lower quality organic inputs and increasing nutrient use efficiency to derive more direct and indirect benefits from the system in summary these examples provide evidence of several pathways by which agroforestry systems can increase c sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,251

Landscape composition is more important than local vegetation structure for understory birds in cocoa agroforestry systems,biodiversityfriendly agricultural systems allow the maintenance of native species even in highly fragmented landscapes by providing corridors to species dispersion and offering supplementary resources for animal populations in the tropical region cocoa agroforestry systems are of great importance for biodiversity conservation as they maintain part of the native vegetation and therefore can be used by the local fauna in this system understory of native forests is replaced by cocoa trees which are shaded by large oldgrowth trees however the persistence of native species in cocoa agroforests depends on local vegetation characteristics but also the landscape structure in which these systems are located here we investigated the influence of landscape composition ie amount of forest cover cocoa agroforestry and cattle pasture and local vegetation structure ie number of native and cocoa trees basal area of native trees and canopy closure on understory birds in 18 cocoa agroforestry systems located in three regions in the brazilian atlantic forest presenting distinct land use contexts specifically we assessed the effects of these landscape and local features in predicting richness and abundance patterns of the entire community and also in distinct ecological groups such as forestdependent and nonforestdependent birds and insectivores frugivores and omnivores using generalized linear models and akaike information criterion we observed lower species richness of complete community nonforest and omnivorous birds in the most deforested region also our findings demonstrated that cocoa agroforests integrated in more forested landscapes harbor greater richness and abundance of frugivorous birds conversely the increase in cattle pasture amount at the landscape had a harsh effect on all bird groups evaluated regarding local vegetation we observed that the increase of canopy closure leads to greater abundance of insectivorous birds in cocoa agroforestry systems similarly abundance of nonforest species increased in agroforests with higher number of cocoa trees our study demonstrated that cocoa agroforestry systems can provide complementary habitats for many species including forest birds and therefore can mitigate the effects of habitat loss however this key benefit for bird conservation will be more effective when these agroforestry systems are located in more forested landscapes with low amount of cattle pastures our findings therefore reinforce the alarming need to maintain and recover landscapescale forest amount to ensure species persistence of birds in anthropogenic landscapes even in those comprising biodiversityfriendly land uses such as cocoa agroforestry systems 2020 elsevier bv,265
Fractions of Organic Matter and Soil Carbon Balance in Different Phases of an Agroforestry System in the Cerrado: A Ten-Year Field Assessment,integrated production systems composed of trees crops and pastures have shown good results in improving soil quality and the capacity to store carbon in the soil being efficient in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions despite this changes in carbon stocks and soil organic matter fractions in the initial stages of implementing an agroforestry system remain unclear this study evaluated the carbon balance and the dynamics of soil organic matter fractions in an agroforestry system conducted over a decade total carbon labile carbon carbon from particulate organic matter organic carbon associated with minerals and inert carbon were determined at depths 010 cm 1020 cm and 2040 cm soil carbon stocks were also estimated for the 040 cm depth total carbon increased in the agroforestry system compared with a lowproductivity pasture the total carbon stock in the last growing season 6857 mg ha1 was close to the original soil stocks under native cerrado vegetation 765 mg ha1 after 10 years there was a positive balance in the soil carbon stock of both the total carbon and the soil organic matter fractions the successional agroforestry system is a good alternative to increasing soil total carbon stocks and labile and nonlabile fractions of soil organic matter,266
Agroforestry Land Use Land Cover Area Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm,monitoring the location and extent of agroforestry land use land cover lulc in lampung province is critical for effective policy development and sustainable agroforestry management however existing monitoring efforts have been limited to small regions this study addressed this gap by employing threshold values from five distinct vegetation indices arvi evi gdvi ndvi and savi derived from landsat 9 oli imagery to accurately identify and estimate agroforestry lulc across the lampung province the data collection activities were carried out using a combination of landsat 9 oli satellite imagery acquisition and ground truth validation on 7 classes of different land use forest agroforestry dry land farming ricefield settlements bare land and water bodies within 5600 points of interest poi inside 5 regencies as an area of interest aoi this study aimed to predict agroforestry area based on vegetation indices vis threshold using the decision tree dt algorithm the research process involved a series of systematic steps beginning with satellite image data acquisition and preprocessing vis values extraction and dt sequential for agroforestry areas the dt computation incorporated the value of each lulc type on the 5 vis the result showed that the overall accuracy reached 9159 with a kappa coefficient of 089 indicating a high level of accuracy for land cover identification the dt algorithm calculation showed that the agroforestry in lampung province estimated spanned for 73473961 ha determined only by ndvi and arvi the findings have significant implications for both policy development and agroforestry management accurate lulc classification enhances decisionmaking processes by providing reliable data on land use patterns which can guide sustainable land management practices and support the creation of regionspecific agroforestry policies this research directly informs policymakers on the extent and distribution of agroforestry areas offering a foundation for crafting strategies aimed at promoting sustainable land use while mitigating environmental degradation the methodology also provides a scalable approach for other regions facing similar agroforestry and land management challenges,267
Spectroscopic Investigation on the Effects of Biochar and Soluble Phosphorus on Grass Clipping Vermicomposting,seeking to evaluate the hypothesis that biochar optimises the composting and vermicomposting processes as well as their product quality we carried out field and greenhouse experiments four grass clipping composting treatments only grass grass single superphosphate ssp grass biochar and grass ssp biochar were evaluated at the end of the maturation period 150 days the composts were submitted to vermicomposting eisenia fetida earthworm for an additional 90 days ordinary fine charcoal was selected due to its low cost a byproduct of charcoal production and great availability this is important since the obtained product presents low commercial value a greater maturity of the organic matter humification was observed in the vermicompost treatments compared with the compostonly treatments the addition of phosphate significantly reduced the ph from 67 to 48 doubled the electrical conductivity and inhibited biological activity resulting in less than 2 of the number of earthworms found in the treatment without phosphate the addition of soluble phosphate inhibited the humification process resulting in a lessstable compound with the preservation of labile structures primarily cellulose the p species found corroborate these findings because the pyrophosphate conversion from ssp in the absence of biochar may explain the strong acidification and increased electric conductivity biochar appears to prevent this conversion thus mitigating the deleterious effects of ssp and favouring the formation of organic p species from ssp 785 of p in organic form with biochar compared to only 128 in the treatments without biochar in short biochar decreases pyrophosphate formation from ssp avoiding acidification and salinity therefore biochar improves the whole composting and vermicomposting process and product quality vermicompost with ssp and biochar should be tested as a soil conditioner on account of its greater proportion of stabilized c and organic p,268
Intercropping and environmental seasonality modulate the physiology and growth of Hancornia speciosa (Gomes),background the recovery process of degraded areas with the implantation of orchards of native species is still little known thus we intend to evaluate the physiological performance of hancornia speciosa during different seasons of the year cultivated in full sun and in intercropping for recovery of degraded areas methods intercropping with syagrus oleracea double intercropping with annual crops double intercropping and with s oleracea and annual crops triple intercropping were completed over two years at the beginning of each season crops experimental plots were planted using a nelder wheel design results over the two years h speciosa was observed to experience seasonal regulatory changes some of which were mitigated by the intercropping the cultivation arrangement influenced the physiology and consequently the growth of h speciosa conclusions it is concluded that the double intercropping benefits the growth of h speciosa during the formation of the orchard and the triple intercropping does not affect growth in relation to full sun it is recommended the implantation of orchards of h speciosa in recovery areas through intercropping,269
Cover crops for no-tillage vegetable systems as a climate crisis mitigation strategy in organic Cucurbitaceae production,the conventional vegetable farming model aggravates the climate crisis whereas the notillage system provides a sustainable alternative this study aimed to identify winter cover crops for single cropping and intercropping by evaluating the biomass production and degradability as well as their impact on cucurbitaceae production in organic notillage system the experiment was conducted in an area with cucurbita pepo var melopepo and other with cucumis sativus a randomized complete block design was used with three replicates the treatments included the single cropping of black oat avena strigosa rye secale cereale and vetch vicia sativa as well as the intercropping systems black oat vetch black oat vetch radish raphanus sativus rye vetch radish and winter fallow the poaceae treatments showed a higher biomass production and halflife with the black oat biomass contributing to the greatest zucchini yield whereas the japanese cucumber showed a superior performance when grown with cover crops thus the black oat vetch radish or rye vetch radish intercropping systems are the most recommended ones for the organic notillage system,270
Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest,unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity environments that harbor a huge structural complexity such as agroforestry systems even the simplest ones may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services to examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity we evaluate dung beetle scarabaeidae scarabaeinae diversity in different land uses considering brazilian atlantic forest cacaorubber agroforestry and rubber monoculture we found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture as cacaorubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity we suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes,271
Reclamation of Saline Soil under Association between Atriplex nummularia L. and Glycophytes Plants,phytoremediation is an efficient technique for the reclamation of saltaffected soils by growing plants the present study aims to evaluate the intercropping of halophyte atriplex nummularia lindl with naturally occurring species mimosa caesalpiniifolia benth leucaena leucocephala lam de wit and azadirachta indica a juss adapted to semiarid regions as a management capable of enhancing the phytoremediation capacity of these species a field experiment was conducted in a randomized block and contained four replicates species were cultivated alone and in association with a nummularia to evaluate their potential uses in the reclamation of soils exchangeable ca2 mg2 na and k as well as salinity and sodicity variables were evaluated the evaluations were performed at 9 and 18 months of plant growth the results indicated that a nummularia individualized was the treatment most efficient with reductions of 80 63 and 84 in electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and exchangeable sodium percentage values respectively at 18 months compared to starting of the experiment however the use of a nummularia and species adapted to the semiarid in association or even alone promoted beneficial effects on the soil quality after the establishment of the plants,272
Intercropping Short Rotation Timber Species with Teak: Enabling Smallholder Silviculture Practices,community forest management for timber production requires short and longrotation companion species to fulfill the demands of the timber industry improve farmer welfare and maintain environmental sustainability four species falcataria moluccana neolamarckia cadamba acacia mangium and gmelina arborea were tested as shortrotation timber crop companion species for teak tectona grandis on dryrocky soil in the gunungkidul community forest the selection of shortrotation timber species was based on growth performance and survival rate at the teak site two years after planting the viability of g arborea 873 and a mangium 782 was significantly p 005 higher than that of n cadamba 406 and f moluccana 180 g arborea and n cadamba achieved the best growth in terms of height diameter basal area and volume with the growth of a mangium and f moluccana being significantly inferior gmelina arborea has the ability to adapt to teak sites grow well and accompany teak neolamarckia cadamba demonstrated good growth with potential as a teak companion and it demonstrated limited drought tolerance on the dryrocky soils of the study sites acacia mangium had a high survival but produced slow growth indicating that it required an advance evaluation in future years falcataria moluccana has different growing site requirements to teak so the performance was relatively poor at the study site this mixed pattern provides benefits to farmers through commercial thinning of short rotations species 58 years post establishment thinning operations will also increase the productivity of residual teak stands the diversification of timber species in community forests can provide earlier returns enabling the adoption of silviculture management by smallholders and communities,273
Indicators to quantify biodiversity gains for compensation and mineland rehabilitation in the Eastern Amazon,to connect the protection of natural resources to economic development environmental rehabilitation is a promising way to repair and compensate for impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services here we aimed to compare and select potential indicators for the success of different rehabilitating ecosystems to quantify gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services within the impact mitigation hierarchy we sampled nine environmental variables along rehabilitation chronosequences from rehabilitating i iron mining waste piles ii sand quarries and iii compensation areas in the caraj aacutes national forest from that we computed the rehabilitation status ie the proportion of environmental enhancements compared to the overall rehabilitation trajectory and statistically validated the indicators that best described the status with a mean rehabilitation status for the oldest rehabilitation stages from waste piles sand quarries and compensation areas of 52 71 and 74 respectively we confirmed that rehabilitation activities were able to generate considerable gains in biodiversity in all the cases the shannon diversity phylogenetic diversity and leaf area index performed better than did the other indices encouraging the increased use of these indices for upscale monitoring activities consistent indicators across distinct projects highlight the importance of maximizing tree diversity and canopy closure in rehabilitation projects to increase biodiversity gains within impact mitigation hierarchy,274

Farmers' assessment of the use value of agrobiodiversity in complex cocoa agroforestry systems in central Cameroon,agroforestry systems in humid tropical areas are complex multispecies cropping systems whose value for farmers is often hard to assess we present the findings of a participatory assessment that we applied to cocoa agroforestry systems this assessment adapted from the pebble distribution method was used to quantify the value given by farmers to each species of their cocoa agroforestry system according to the attributed uses a tree inventory in 50 cocoa agroforests was carried out in central cameroon overall 122 noncocoa tree species were inventoried the mean species richness was 23 species per plot and the mean shannon index was 242 for a mean density of 180 noncocoa trees ha1 and 1511 cocoa trees ha1 cocoa farmers defined seven different uses for tree species including theobroma cacao 81 of the species including cocoa trees had one to seven uses whereas the highest use value was given to t cacao with a mean score of 236 then in descending order the 10 noncocoa species with the highest use values were dacryodes edulis persea americana elaeis guineensis citrus sinensis mangifera indica milicia excelsa cola nitida citrus sp ricinodendron heudelotii and terminalia superba the frequency of noncocoa species was significantly and positively correlated with their use value r2 0914 our results showed that technical innovations designed to improve cocoa agroforestry systems should take into account farmers knowledge to propose them systems so as to be able to more effectively address their expectations,279
Use of cover crops in the southern Amazon region: What is the impact on soil physical quality?,introducing cover crops during the rotation system and offseason can provide numerous benefits to the agricultural system such as increased carbon stock and improved soil aeration however in the southern amazon region owing to the hot and humid climate the cover crops used in agricultural production systems may not have the same beneficial effects in the cerrado region this makes it necessary to introduce and study new species of cover crops that have the potential to improve soil quality the objective of this study was to compare over time the dry matter production of eight cover crops and the effects of their cultivation on the physical attributes of the soil in the southern amazon region the experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with analyzes carried out over the 3 years of the experiment in three replicates the treatments were composed of eight cover crops crotalaria crotalaria spectabilis pigeon pea cajanus cajan velvetbean mucuna aterrima buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum ruziziensis grass urochloa ruziziensis brizantha grass urochloa brizantha pearl millet pennisetum glaucum and finger millet eleusine coracana and three evaluation years 2014 2015 and 2016 the cover crops used in the experiment were selected based on their adaptation to the growing conditions and because they have characteristics of agricultural interest in addition cover crops chosen can be used in soybeanmaize rotation systems soybeanmaize succession systems as well as in agriculturelivestock integration systems through integrated cultivation systems using undisturbed soil samples were analyzed the physical variables porosity mechanical resistance to root penetration and water retention pore size distribution was calculated using the first derivative of the equation of van genuchten and s index was determined by the angle of inclination of the soil water retention curve inflection point the results show that leguminous and grassy cover crops act differently under physical soil attributes over time the results indicated that the cultivation of grasses such as p glaucum increased the values of macroporosity 018 m3 m3 in the 000010 m layer at the end of the third year of cultivation consequently reduced the value of soil density up to 114 mg m3 and mechanical resistance to root penetration up to 177 mpa the largest accumulation of dry matter was obtained with the cultivation of u brizantha which consequently proved to be the best cultivation option in the offseason in the southern amazon region the study provides a better understanding of the influence of cover crops on the physical attributes of the soil which will contribute to making the correct recommendation of cover crops that can improve the physical properties of the soil in agricultural frontier regions in the southern amazon rainforest,280
Voisin Rational Grazing as a Sustainable Alternative for Livestock Production,simple summary to meet current global food supply challenges researchers and technicians are searching for alternative livestock systems that promote highly sustainable animal productivity and farm profitability while having a positive environmental footprint in this narrative review we highlight one such system voisin rational grazing vrg vrg is a regenerative livestock farming system proposed by french scientist andre voisin in the 1950s and further developed in brazil in the 1970s vrg has been applied in many countries with vastly different ecosystems like other regenerative systems vrg provides a range of ecosystem services including negative net carbon emission reduced soil erosion and increased biodiversity because vrg is also focused on animal performance farmers applying vrg are more resilient against the adversities confronting farmers practicing more conventional farming systems vrg requires a paradigm shift from the farmers and thus its uptake may be hindered if there is not enough support within the community here we provide a comprehensive overview of vrg along with its benefits and constraints current livestock practices do not meet current realworld social and environmental requirements pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels causing numerous environmental side effects in this narrative review we explore how the voisin rational grazing vrg system responds to this problem vrg is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake while at the same time maintaining system sustainability it applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth moreover paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade improving overall animal welfare in combination these practices result in increased soil c uptake and soil health boost water retention and protect water quality vrg may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient it can be said that vrg practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture its main challenges however arise from social constraints more specifically local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of vrg benefits on animal performance or to overcome vrg limitations,281

Influence of Acacia mangium on Soil Fertility and Bacterial Community in Eucalyptus Plantations in the Congolese Coastal Plains,productivity and sustainability of tropical forest plantations greatly rely on regulation of ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling ie the link between plant growth nutrient availability and the microbial community structure so far these interactions have never been evaluated in the acacia and eucalyptus forest planted on infertile soils in the congolese coastal plains in the present work the soil bacterial community has been investigated by metabarcoding of the 16s rrna bacterial gene in different stands of monoculture and mixedspecies plantation to evaluate the potential of nitrogenfixing trees on nutrient and bacterial structure at the phylum level the soil bacterial community was dominated by actinobacteria followed by proteobacteria firmicutes and acidobacteria a principal coordinate analysis revealed that bacterial communities from pure eucalyptus compared to those from plantations containing acacia in pure and mixedspecies stands showed different community composition betadiversity regardless of the large variability of the studied soils the prevalence of firmicutes phylum and lower bacterial richness and phylogenic diversity were reported in stands containing acacia relative to the pure eucalyptus distancebased redundancy analysis revealed a positive correlation of available phosphorus p and carbonnitrogen cn ratio with bacterial community structure however the spearman correlation test revealed a broad correlation between the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and soil attributes in particular with sulfur s and carbon c suggesting the important role of soil bacterial community in nutrient cycling in this type of forest management concerning mixed plantations a shift in bacterial community structure was observed probably linked to other changes ie improvement in soil fertility enhanced p and c dynamics in forest floor and soil and increase in soil n status and c sequestration in both soil and stand wood biomass with the great potential impact to mitigate climate change overall our findings highlight the role of soil attributes especially c s available p and cn ratio at a lesser extent in driving the soil bacterial community in mixedspecies plantations and its potential to improve soil fertility and to sustain eucalyptus plantations established on the infertile and sandy soils of the congolese coastal plains,287
Potential of biochar to restoration of microbial biomass and enzymatic activity in a highly degraded semiarid soil,biochar is an effective material for enhancing soil ecosystem services however the specific impacts of biochar on microbial indicators particularly in degraded soils remain poorly understood this study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar produced from cashew residues and sewage sludge in a highly degraded soil on microbial indicators we analyzed soil chemical composition and microbial biomass c and n enzyme activity and stoichiometry cashew biochar increased soil respiration indicating a higher availability of c to microorganisms compared to sewage sludge biochar and a better adaptation of soil microbial communities to crich organic material obtained from a native plant although the biochar differentially impacted microbial biomass c both significantly increased n in the microbial biomass arylsulphatase activity did not respond to biochar application while betaglucosidase urease and phosphatases showed significant changes with biochar treatments importantly stoichiometry and vector analysis revealed that both types of biochar increased p limitation for soil microbes conversely both biochar alleviated c and n limitations for the soil microbes thus biochar applications in highly degraded soils should be supplemented with external p sources to maintain soil functions mainly for cashew residues our results provide evidence that biochar can restore soil biological properties and enhance the availability of c and n to microorganisms these findings have significant implications for restoration practices in degraded lands of semiarid regions,288
Soil bacterial communities in the Brazilian Cerrado: Response to vegetation type and management,pasture degradation in the brazilian cerrado the second largest biome in south america is a widespread problem that leads to serious environmental consequences thus pasture restoration is crucial not only because of the economic importance of meat production in brazil but also for mitigation of soil erosion and the effects of climate change furthermore ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration in the present study we used a barcoded pyrosequencing approach to assess soil bacterial communities under three different conditions a native cerrado area an active pasture and a degraded pasture that was planted with native tree species in the three study areas acidobacteria was dominant phylum 2038 followed by proteobacteria 813 ad3 412 verrucomicrobia 311 and firmicutes 38 however the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality the higher abundance of ad3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas comparing the two pasture areas the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture while the relative abundance of acidobacteria showed the opposite trend changes in the abundance of main bacterial phyla even in the initial phases of the restoration process point out for the relevance of microbiological parameters as additional indicators in the monitoring of degradation recovery 2019 elsevier masson sas,289
Contrasting phenology of Eucalyptus grandis fine roots in upper and very deep soil layers in Brazil,background and aims while the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2m the factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change we set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fastgrowing trees in deep tropical soils methods fine root growth and mortality of eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6m from 2 to 4years after planting results in the topsoil the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer 20cm m2 d1 whereas below 2m deep it was at the end of the dry winter 51cm m2 d1 the maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 36cm d1 in the 56m soil layer conclusions our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils 2017 springer international publishing ag,290
Changes in soil C and N stocks and nutrient dynamics 13 years after recovery of degraded land using leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees,in tropical forest areas with highly weathered soils organic matter plays an important role in soil functioning and forest sustainability when forests are clearcut the soil begins almost immediately to lose organic matter triggering a series of soil degradation processes the extent and intensity of which depends on soil management depending on the level of soil degradation the rate at which the system can reestablish itself can be slow and may require the use of degraded land restoration techniques this study aimed at evaluating the potential of pioneer leguminous nitrogenfixing trees to recuperate degraded land the area studied located in the coastal town of angra dos reis in the state of rio de janeiro brazil was planted with seven species of fastgrowing leguminous nitrogenfixing trees in 1991 the nutrient concentrations ca mg p and k and n and c stocks in the soil and litter were determined in addition to the free and occludedlight fractions of soil organic matter soil samples were also collected from two reference areas 1 an area of undisturbed native forest and 2 a deforested area spontaneously colonised by guinea grass panicum maximum the nutrient stocks in the litter of the restored area were similar to those found in native forest the recuperation technique used was able to reestablish the soil c and n stocks after 13 years c and n increased by 173 and 013 mg ha1 year1 respectively the freelight fraction was highest in the recuperated area and lowest in the deforested area the occludedlight fraction of the recuperated area was higher than that of the native forest only in the 05 cm layer both the freelight and occluded fractions were higher in the native forest and recuperated areas than in the deforested area since the freelight and the occludedlight fractions are the result of litterfall and decomposition these results combined with the data of litter stocks and soil c and n stocks indicate that the use of legume trees was efficient in reestablishing the nutrient cycling processes of the systems these results also show that recovering degraded land with this technique is effective in sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates c 2007 elsevier bv all rights reserved,291
Land-use change shifts and magnifies seasonal variations of the decomposer system in lowland tropical landscapes,deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems climatic changes manifest in increased inter and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events ie droughts and floods which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity however until today there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems which may be more buffered against climatic variation here we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters basal respiration microbial communities and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in sumatra indonesia about 75 20 out of 26 of the measured litter and soil microbial and animal parameters varied with season with seasonal changes in 50 of the parameters depending on land use land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate the magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40 higher than in the soil of rainforest measured parameters were associated with shortterm climatic conditions 3day period air humidity in plantations but not in rainforest confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations overall our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment with microbial communities responding most strongly the increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term as the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change these shifts need closer attention for the longterm sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics 2022 the authors ecology and evolution published by john wiley sons ltd,292
"The role of land use, management, and microbial diversity depletion on glyphosate biodegradation in tropical soils",land use and management changes affect the composition and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi which in turn may alter soil health and the provision of key ecological functions such as pesticide degradation and soil detoxification however the extent to which these changes affect such services is still poorly understood in tropical agroecosystems our main goal was to evaluate how landuse tilled versus notilled soil soil management nfertilization and microbial diversity depletion tenfold d1 101 and thousandfold d3 103 dilutions impacted soil enzyme activities betaglycosidase and acid phosphatase involved in nutrient cycles and glyphosate mineralization soils were collected from a longterm experimental area 35 years and compared to its native forest soil nf glyphosate was selected due to its intensive use in agriculture worldwide and in the study area as well as its recalcitrance in the environment by forming inner sphere complexes bacterial communities played a more important role than the fungi in glyphosate degradation for this function the role of microbial diversity was more critical than land use and soil management our study also revealed that conservation tillage systems such as notillage regardless of nitrogen fertilizer use mitigates the negative effects of microbial diversity depletion being more efficient and resilient regarding glyphosate degradation than conventional tillage systems notilled soils also presented much higher betaglycosidase and acid phosphatase activities as well as higher bacterial diversity indexes than those under conventional tillage consequently conservation tillage is a key component for sustaining soil health and its functionality providing critical ecosystem functions such as soil detoxification in tropical agroecosystems,293

"Conversion of tropical lowland forest reduces nutrient return through litterfall, and alters nutrient use efficiency and seasonality of net primary production",tropical landscapes are not only rapidly transformed by ongoing landuse change but are additionally confronted by increasing seasonal climate variation there is an increasing demand for studies analyzing the effects and feedbacks on ecosystem functioning of largescale conversions of tropical natural forest into intensively managed cash crop agriculture we analyzed the seasonality of aboveground litterfall fine root litter production and aboveground woody biomass production anppwoody in natural lowland forests rubber agroforests under natural tree cover jungle rubber rubber and oil palm monocultures along a foresttoagriculture transformation gradient in sumatra we hypothesized that the temporal fluctuation of litter production increases with increasing landuse intensity while the associated nutrient fluxes and nutrient use efficiency nue decrease indeed the seasonal variation of aboveground litter production and anppwoody increased from the natural forest to the plantations while aboveground litterfall generally decreased nutrient return through aboveground litter was mostly highest in the natural forest however it was significantly lower only in rubber plantations nue of n p and k was lowest in the oil palm plantations with natural forest and the rubber systems showing comparably high values root litter production was generally lower than leaf litter production in all systems while the roottoleaf ratio of litter c flux increased along the landuse intensity gradient our results suggest that nutrient and c cycles are more directly affected by climate seasonality in speciespoor agricultural systems than in speciesrich forests and therefore might be more susceptible to interannual climate fluctuation and climate change,298
Nitrogen aboveground turnover and soil stocks to 8 m depth in primary and selectively logged forest in southern Amazonia,extensive areas of amazonia undergo selective logging modifying forest structure and nutrient cycles anthropogenicaccelerated rates of nitrogen n turnover could increase n loss and affect regeneration carbon sequestration and timber production we quantified leaf area reduction canopy opening and downed biomass and resultant n flux from reduced impact logging ril activities we compared canopy reduction surface soil moisture and nitrate to 8 m depth between logged gaps and intact primary forest to determine if logging activities increase subsoil nitrate to test longterm logging effects we evaluated surface n stocks along a 12year postlogging chronosequence at the harvest rate of 26 trees ha1 total n additions in logging gaps including leaves and wood from felled crowns 248 kg n ha1 and other killed trees 419 kg n ha1 accounted for over 80 of the total n addition to aboveground necromass from all logging activities 819 kg n ha1 despite this n turnover by logging belowground nitrate storage to 8 m depth did not differ between logging gaps and primary forest at the low harvest rate and disturbance intensity of this study soil water depletion also did not differ between gaps and primary forest over 1 year indicating the impact on belowground inorganic n was low compared with primary forest nitrate concentrations to 8 m depth in logging gaps were only significantly higher at 60100 cm suggesting some n redistribution beyond the bulk of the fine roots in logging gaps extrapolated to the amazon basin scale we provide a conservative estimate that logging damage and bole export under ril would turn over 014 007 to 023 012 tg n yr1 based on 19992002 selective logging rates greater damage during conventional selective logging would cause higher n turnover throughout the amazon basin than our results based on ril,299

Aboveground Carbon Storage and Cycling of Flooded and Upland Forests of the Brazilian Pantanal,tropical forests and savanna cerrado are important carbon c sinks however few data exist for seasonally flooded forests we quantified the annual rates of aboveground net primary production anpp over a fiveyear period for two forests an upland mixed forest and a seasonally flooded cerrado forest located in the northern pantanal region of brazil we hypothesized that rates of anpp would be higher for the mixed forest than the cerrado forest because seasonal flooding can limit rates of tree growth anpp was calculated as the sum of the annual litter production measured from litterfall traps and the stem growth increment measured from dendrometers and tree density anpp varied between 3855 mgc ha1y1for the flooded forest and 1646 mgc ha1y1for the upland forest litter production accounted for 57 of the anpp and the difference in anpp between the upland and flooded forests was due to consistently higher litter production in the flooded forest annual variations in anpp were not correlated with annual precipitation presumably because the hydrology of these sites is driven more by the flood stage of the cuiaba river than by local precipitation however consistent declines in forest floor litter mass occurred at both sites suggesting that c storage may be responding to some unknown disturbance that occurred prior to our sampling campaign seasonal variation in rainfall exerted an important control on litter production dynamics with leaf litter production increasing during the dry season and stem and reproductive litter production increasing during the wet season while there are few studies of seasonally flooded tropical forests our data suggest that the seasonally flooded and upland forests of the northern pantanal can act as appreciable aboveground c sinks,305
"The productivity, allocation and cycling of carbon in forests at the dry margin of the Amazon forest in Bolivia",background the dry transitional forests of the southern amazonia have received little attention from a carbon cycling and ecosystem function perspective yet they represent ecosystems that may be impacted by global climate change in the futureaims to compare the full carbon cycle for two 1ha forest plots that straddle the ecotone between humid forest and dry forest in amazonia ca 100 km from santa cruz boliviamethods 25 years of measurements of the components of net primary production npp and autotrophic respiration were collectedresults total npp was 155 089 mg c ha1 year1 at the humid site and 1127 068 mg c ha1 year1 at the dry site a total gross primary production gpp of 3414 292 mg c ha1 year1 and 2688 270 mg c ha1 year1 at the two sites carbon use efficiency for both sites was higher than reported for other amazonian forests 045 005 and 042 005conclusions drier soil conditions selected for the dry deciduous tree species which had higher leaf photosynthesis and total gpp npp allocation patterns were similar at the two sites suggesting that in terms of carbon allocation the dry forests of the southern amazonia behave as a scaleddown version of wetter humid forests,306
Response of soil organic carbon to land-use change in central Brazil: a large-scale comparison of Ferralsols and Acrisols,the southeastern part of the amazon region is one of the largest agricultural frontiers in the world leading to extensive landuse change this paper provides evidence for the impacts of landuse change on soil organic carbon oc stocks along a large scale for ferralsols and acrisols including subsoilwe took soil samples to 100 cm depth for native vegetation pasture and cropfield along a 1000 km agricultural transect in central brazil to determine oc stocks and by using a stable isotope approach losses of forestderived ocat the scale of individual plots soil oc stocks indicate a highly heterogeneous response to landuse change eg in ferralsols in 030 cm from 45 to 57 mg oc ha1 after conversion to pasture but relatively minor responses when considering the complete transect ie no significant oc changes for similar landuse type acrisols evidenced a slower decline of forestderived oc and simultaneously a faster accumulation of pasturederived oc than ferralsols surprisingly the impact of landuse change was more pronounced in the subsoilour results emphasize the role of subsoils on carbon cycling which has been previously underestimated but may also raise doubts whether oc stocks in soil is an appropriate parameter to assess the impacts of landuse conversion on climate change,307

SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT AND TILLAGE SYSTEMS OF PERMANENT INTERCROPPED COVER SPECIES IN AN ORANGE ORCHARD,to mitigate soil erosion and enhance soil fertility in orange plantations the permanent protection of the interrows by cover species has been suggested the objective of this study was to evaluate alterations in the microbial biomass due to different soil tillage systems and intercropped cover species between rows of orange trees the soil of the experimental area previously used as pasture brachiaria humidicola was an ultisol typic paleudult originating from caiua sandstone in the northwestern part of the state of parana brazil two soil tillage systems were evaluated conventional tillage ct in the entire area and strip tillage st strip width 2 m in combination with different ground cover management systems the citrus cultivar pera orange citrus sinensis grafted onto rangpur lime rootstock was used soil samples were collected after five years of treatment from a depth of 015 cm under the tree canopy and in the interrow in the following treatments 1 ct and an annual cover crop with the leguminous species calopogonium mucunoides 2 ct and a perennial cover crop with the leguminous peanut arachis pintoi 3 ct and an evergreen cover crop with bahiagrass paspalum notatum 4 ct and a cover crop with spontaneous brachiaria humidicola grass vegetation and 5 st and maintenance of the remaining grass pasture of brachiaria humidicola soil tillage and the different cover species influenced the microbial biomass both under the tree canopy and in the interrow the cultivation of brachiaria increased c and n in the microbial biomass while bahiagrass increased p in the microbial biomass the soil microbial biomass was enriched in n and p by the presence of ground cover species and according to the soil p content the grass species increased c n and p in the soil microbial biomass from the interrow more than leguminous species,317
Soil organic carbon pools controlled by climate and geochemistry in tropical volcanic regions,understanding the factors that control the storage of soil organic carbon soc is an urgent priority for mitigating global climate problems the objective of this study was to determine the factors controlling soc pools with differing stabilities surface soil samples were collected along an elevation gradient from four volcanic regions of tanzania two regions and indonesia two regions under largelyundisturbed vegetation 24 sites in total a threepool kinetic model was fitted to accumulative co2 release curve produced over 343day incubation to determine the sizes of the labile and intermediate soc pools cl and ci respectively and their mean residence times 1kl and 1ki respectively where the size of the stable soc pool cs was measured as nonhydrolyzable carbon correlation and path analyses were performed using the results of soil fractionation and model fitting with climatic and geochemical propertiesthe intermediate pool comprised 50 of total soc was responsible for 58 of total accumulative co2 release and controlled total soc stability the content of nanocrystalline minerals alo 12feo 55110 g kg1 was strongly correlated with ci and cs suggesting that organomineral complexes is the essential factor that controls ci and cs rather than soil texture or ph temperature 1226 degrees c was weakly correlated with ci cs and strongly with cl which was closely related to microbial biomass carbon the low temperature at the high elevation sites retards the decomposition of the whole soc the significant correlations of excess precipitation with 1kl and 1ki represent the effect of moisture on the potential stabilities of the labile and intermediate soc pools climatic factors primarily affect relatively labile soc pools whereas geochemical factors influence more stable pools and control total soc the findings have important implications for understanding the soc stabilization mechanisms which is an essential process of the carbon cycle in tropical volcanic soils c 2020 elsevier bv all rights reserved,318
Climatic and biotic controls on annual carbon storage in Amazonian ecosystems,1 the role of undisturbed tropical land ecosystems in the global carbon budget is not well understood it has been suggested that interannual climate variability can affect the capacity of these ecosystems to store carbon in the short term in this paper we use a transient version of the terrestrial ecosystem model tem to estimate annual carbon storage in undisturbed amazonian ecosystems during the period 198094 and to understand the underlying causes of the yeartoyear variations in net carbon storage for this region2 we estimate that the total carbon storage in the undisturbed ecosystems of the amazon basin in 1980 was 1276 pg c with about 943 pg c in vegetation and 333 pg c in the reactive pool of soil organic carbon about 83 of the total carbon storage occurred in tropical evergreen forests based on our models results we estimate that over the past 15 years the total carbon storage has increased by 31 pg c 2 with a 19pg c 2 increase in vegetation carbon and a 12pg c 4 increase in reactive soil organic carbon the modelled results indicate that the largest relative changes in net carbon storage have occurred in tropical deciduous forests but that the largest absolute changes in net carbon storage have occurred in the moist and wet forests of the basin3 our results show that the strength of interannual variations in net carbon storage of undisturbed ecosystems in the amazon basin varies from a carbon source of 02 pg cyear to a carbon sink of 07 pg cyear precipitation especially the amount received during the drier months appears to be a major controller of annual net carbon storage in the amazon basin our analysis indicates further that changes in precipitation combine with changes in temperature to affect net carbon storage through influencing soil moisture and nutrient availability4 on average our results suggest that the undisturbed amazonian ecosystems accumulated 02 pg cyear as a result of climate variability and increasing atmospheric co2 over the study period this amount is large enough to have compensated for most of the carbon losses associated with tropical deforestation in the amazon during the same period5 comparisons with empirical data indicate that climate variability and co2 fertilization explain most of the variation in net carbon storage for the undisturbed ecosystems our analyses suggest that assessment of the regional carbon budget in the tropics should be made over at least one cycle of el ninosouthern oscillation because of interannual climate variability our analyses also suggest that proper scaling of the sitespecific and subannual measurements of carbon fluxes to produce basinwide flux estimates must take into account seasonal and spatial variations in net carbon storage,319

Reforestation can compensate negative effects of climate change on amphibians,climate and landuse change are major drivers of biodiversity loss but their combined effects are still unclear reforestation may compensate or reduce climate change impacts on species but this hypothesis has not been tested yet here we quantify the additive and synergistic effects of forest change in particular reforestation and climate changes on ten endemic and forestdependent anurans of the atlantic forest biodiversity hotspot we estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future 2050 conditions using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive landuse model we contrasted a pessimistic landuse scenario with little change in forest cover with an optimistic scenario with forest gain through restoration of legal reserve areas our models show that climate change will have speciesspecific effects on anurans increasing climatic suitability for seven species but decreasing for three for these three species we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change increasing overall environmental suitability these results reinforce the importance of ensuring reforestation and forest protection as a climate change adaptation strategy for biodiversity,328
Bioenergy-livestock integration in Brazil: Unraveling potentials for energy production and climate change mitigation,future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands which can increase pressure on land use while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics simultaneously agricultural production models that coproduce food feed and energy offer sustainability synergies and cobenefits but sitespecific sustainability assessments of their largescale implementation are missing this study presents a bottomup approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergylivestock integrated systems bli in brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands to climate change mitigation targets and their impacts on selected ecosystem services including bioenergy production climate change mitigation reduction of food competition biodiversity conservation and avoided deforestation the proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels byproducts as animal feed supplement taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains the expansion of the bli system in the centersouth region of brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export this production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the sugarcane agroecological zoning excluding the amazon and pantanal biomes and biodiversity hotspots bli expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of co2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits the best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of so paulo east of mato grosso do sul and the southcentral region of the states of gois this study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable largescale deployment of bli systems 2023 elsevier ltd,329
A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution,with the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration protecting enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbondense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil in order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects to close this knowledge gap we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machinelearning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution this model which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global soilgrids 250 m model was able to capture 63 of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density rmse of 109 kg m3 of the local variables total suspended sediment load and landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 64 pg c for the top meter of soil with an 86729 mg c ha1 range across all pixels by utilizing remotelysensed mangrove forest cover change data loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30122 tg c with 75 of this loss attributable to indonesia malaysia and myanmar the resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in paymentfor ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies 2018 the authors published by iop publishing ltd,330
Climate change mitigation potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations,international agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through extensive mitigation worldwide several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land the greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics and the atlantic forest is among the protagonists however little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change here we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of atlantic forest reforestations both in the field and in the available scientific literature we demonstrate that the atlantic forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation even at young age reforestations have astonishing potential with much higher carbon sequestration rates than unassisted natural regeneration of later successional stages although with lesser potential unassisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation especially when close to reforestations or oldgrowth forests we found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation climate action is urgent and the atlantic forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals,331
Towards understanding climate change impacts: monitoring the vegetation dynamics of terrestrial national parks in Indonesia,monitoring vegetation dynamics in terrestrial national parks tnps is crucial for ensuring sustainable environmental management and mitigating the potential negative impacts of short and longterm disturbances understanding the effect of climate change within natural and protected areas this study aims to monitor the vegetation dynamics of tnps in indonesia by first categorizing them into the regions of sumatra jawa kalimantan sulawesi and eastern indonesia and then applying readytouse modis evi timeseries imageries mod13q1 taken from 2000 to 2022 on the gee cloudcomputing platform specifically this research investigates the greening and browning fraction trends using sens slope considers seasonality by analyzing the maximum and minimum evi values and assesses anomalous years by comparing the annual time series and longterm median evi value the findings reveal significantly increasing greening trends in most tnps except danau sentarum from 2000 to 2022 the seasonality analysis shows that most tnps exhibit peak and trough greenness at the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively as the vegetation response to precipitation increases and decreases anomalies in seasonality that is affected by climate change was detected in all of the regions to increase tnps resilience suggested measures include active reforestation and implementation of assisted natural regeneration strengthen the enforcement of fundamental managerial task and forest fire management the authors 2024,332
Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: making REDD a reality,reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of central importance in efforts to combat climate change key scientific challenges must be addressed to prevent any policy roadblocks foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage here we review a range of methods available to estimate nationallevel forest carbon stocks in developing countries while there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country both groundbased and remotesensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships here we synthesize map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of nationallevel forest carbon stock estimates these forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the intergovernmental panel on climate changes national greenhouse gas inventory guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates,333
Peatland restoration as an affordable nature-based climate solution with fire reduction and conservation co-benefits in Indonesia,ecosystem restoration is increasingly employed as a naturebased solution to a range of crises decisions over restoration must balance limited resources land constraints and competing demands peatlands in southeast asia have been heavily impacted by agricultural expansion over the past three decades with indonesia now accounting for a substantial proportion of degraded tropical peatlands globally using spatial linear programming we focus on prioritizing peatland restoration sites in indonesia for fire risk reduction climate change mitigation species conservation and costeffectiveness the study finds that restoring peatlands at 1 km2 planning units can generate multiple cobenefits such as reduced fire risks by 637 attenuated extinction risks of peatland specialist bird species and mitigated climate change potential of 0002036 pg co2e yr1 these benefits were reduced but still of comparable magnitude when larger areas of planning defined by village and catchment boundaries were used the results although indicative support tropical peatland restoration as a costefficient strategy for mitigating climate change reducing fire conserving biodiversity and supporting sustainable development that can be offset by carbon prices of usd 237mg co2e,334
Does conservation agriculture deliver climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration in tropical agro-ecosystems?,conservation agriculture ca comprising minimum soil disturbance retention of crop residues and crop diversification is widely promoted for reducing soil degradation and improving agricultural sustainability it is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration we conducted a metaanalysis of soil organic carbon soc stock changes under ca practices in two tropical regions the indogangetic plains igp and subsaharan africa ssa to quantify this in igp annual increases in soc stock compared to conventional practice were between 016 and 049 mg c ha1 yr1 in ssa increases were between 028 and 096 mg c ha1 yr1 but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase most reported soc stock increases under ca are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology soc increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic c within the landscape or soil profile in smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of ca further decreasing realistic mitigation potential comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen n fertilizer in regions such as igp where n use is already high suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change however the mitigation potential and other benefits from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering ca and warrant greater attention increases in soc concentration as opposed to stock in nearsurface soil from ca cause improvements in soil physical conditions these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields ca should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit not a major policy driver for its adoption c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved,335
Detecting and interpreting secondary forest on an old Amazonian frontier,land uses that replace tropical forests are important determinants of terrestrial carbon storage and biodiversity this includes secondary forest growth after deforestation which has been integrated into the redd reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation concept as a means to enhance current forest carbon stocks incorporating secondary forest into climate change mitigation efforts requires both accurate measurements and a means to target interventions to achieve additionality we demonstrate how remote sensing and household survey data can be combined to meet these requirements in old frontiers of the brazilian amazon and introduce the idea that annual landcover transitions measured at the pixel level and over time can serve as leading indicators of secondary forest regrowth the patterns we observe are consistent with the suggested tension between equity and additionality in redd the poorest households on the poorest quality lots already allow forest regeneration policy interventions to encourage regeneration are likely to have the greatest additional impact on higher quality lots owned by better capitalized households,336
Forest regeneration may reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of a tropical hotspot,aim evaluate how largescale forest regeneration based on a lowcost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction location brazilian atlantic forest baf methods we built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on species distribution models sdm which employed 79462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios sdm were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness finally we assessed the species risk of extinction based on the speciesarea relationship results without considering the effects of climate change the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 725 sd 8 in the scenario of potential regeneration climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species which may suffer a mean reduction of 744 sd 93 in their current potential distribution areas baf regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species in future climate scenario 34 of species may become extinct but we show that largescale regeneration may prevent these extinctions main conclusions despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67 of the studied species which would increase the risk of species extinction our analysis indicated that promoting largescale baf restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss,337
The role of natural regeneration to ecosystem services provision and habitat availability: a case study in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets however these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes here we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the atlantic forest we classified current landuse cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring we then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services we also modeled how landuse changes affect habitat availability for species we found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20yr habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities although by different magnitudes improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers decision making more in line with societal benefits this alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a largescale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges 2016 the association for tropical biology and conservation,338
Agrosilvopastoral system as a potential model for increasing soil carbon stocks: a century model approach,agrosilvopastoral systems have been used as sustainable production models that can promote soil organic carbon soc storage however there are no simulation studies with the century model to estimate the soc accumulation capacity in the long term analyzing the effects of management and climate change in integrated crop livestockforest iclf systems this study aimed to simulate soil c dynamics in two chronosequences of landuse composed of native vegetation nv degraded pasture dpa and iclf system in the cerrado of minas gerais in addition to designing future scenarios to verify the potential of soc accumulation through climate change the results showed that the century model reliably simulated the soc stocks in the two chronosequences evaluated the model predicted an increase in soc stocks at two sites by converting the dpa system 4604 and 4238 mg ha1 into iclf systems 5494 and 5171 mg ha1 the century also predicted that a 20 mm decrease in rainfall and a 2 degc increase in temperature in the tropical regions studied could reduce the soc stocks more expressively in degraded pastures while agroforestry systems could show a smaller reduction in soc stocks in addition the results showed that replacing degraded pastures into agrosilvopastoral systems especially in clayey soils contributes to increasing soc stocks thus agroforestry systems are potentially viable to maintain the sustainability of agriculture in the face of climate change,339
The effectiveness of acoustic indices for forest monitoring in Atlantic rainforest fragments,forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change birds are widely used for this purpose and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes however previous studies yield controversial results thus we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional pointcounts survey for forest monitoring in an atlantic rainforest fragment in southern bahia brazil we also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection there was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index from the six acoustic indices evaluated we also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the pointcount survey caused bias in acoustic indices therefore more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the atlantic tropical rainforest 2018 elsevier ltd,340
Cabruca agroforestry systems reduce vulnerability of cacao plantations to climate change in southern Bahia,in southern bahia brazils traditional cacao region cacao is mostly grown under the shade of thinned atlantic forest known as cabruca these agroforestry systems are gradually being replaced by unshaded cacao monocultures that might be more vulnerable to changes in climate however the impacts of climate change have not been evaluated yet we assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of cacao plantations in southern bahia and evaluated to what extent the cabrucas reduce the vulnerability of cacao as compared to unshaded plantations we measured the maximum temperature in a gradient of canopy cover during the warmest month of the year and projected ecological niche models maxent on climate projections for 2050 simulating the microclimate of three production systems cabrucas intermediate shading and unshaded plantations we found that canopy cover drastically reduces daily maximum temperature so that understory temperature in cabrucas can be up to 60 c lower than in unshaded plantations we show for the first time that all projected environmental changes negatively affect cacao in southern bahia diminishing its climatic suitability and reducing overall suitable areas across the region more importantly this study is the first one to show that cabrucas can reduce the negative impacts of climate change for cacao especially where temperature extremes approach or exceed crop tolerance limits we conclude that maximizing shortterm profits by implementing unshaded monocultures will likely lead to production losses in the long term cabrucas have a central role in reducing the vulnerability of cacao to climate change and since these traditional agroforestry systems cannot be quickly restored their conservation should be an important goal of agricultural policies in the region 2022 inrae and springerverlag france sas part of springer nature,341
Mangrove Recovery in Semiarid Coast Shows Increase of Ecological Processes from Biotic and Abiotic Drivers in Response to Hydrological Restoration,the installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide in semiarid regions where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts in brazil several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats apicuns ie sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves these areas often hypersaline can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases and should therefore be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise to restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks former apicum area in northeast brazil hydrological restoration measures were applied which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and waterborne propagules in two years mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area after decades of slow monospecific avicennia germinans recovery survival of planted rhizophora mangle propagules was high and naturally established avicennia germinans and laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling these results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups ecological interactions like facilitation herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts 2022 the authors under exclusive licence to society of wetland scientists,342
Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration activities,background forest landscape restoration flr has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes however the extent to which these activities capture co2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist to fill this gap we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of flr activities natural regeneration planted forests and woodlots agroforestry and mangrove restoration across the globe and global co2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals grouped by flr activity and regionclimateresults planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest co2 removal rates ranging from 45 to 407 t co2 h1 year1 during the first 20 years of growth mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient flr at removing co2 with growth rates up to 231 t co2 ha1 year1 the first 20 years post restoration natural regeneration removal rates were 91188 t co2 ha1 year1 during the first 20 years of forest regeneration followed by agroforestry the flr category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates 108156 t co2 ha1 year1 biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration representing 45 and 32 of all the data points assessed respectively agroforestry studies were only found in africa asia and the latin america and caribbean regionsconclusion this study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and co2 removals to date which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific flr activities across the globe these rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decisionmakers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned flr actions or by countries making restoration pledges under the bonn challenge commitments or fulfil ling nationally determined contributions to the unfccc thereby helping boost flr efforts worldwide,343
Silvopastoral system with Eucalyptus as a strategy for mitigating the effects of climate change on Brazilian pasturelands,the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of eucalyptus trees in a silvopastoral system on the microclimate and the capacity of that to mitigate the effects of climate change on pasturelands this study included an open pasture of piat palisadegrass and an adjacent pasture that contained both palisadegrass and easttowest rows of eucalyptus trees with 15 m between rows 2 m between trees within rows the micrometeorological measurements were collected at several distances from the tree rows and in the open pasture the silvopastoral system was associated with greater betweenrow shading when solar declination was high and greater neartree shading when solar declination was around22 both soil heat flux and temperature were influenced by solar radiation wind speed and the ability of tree canopies to reduce radiation losses wind speed was consistently lower in the silvopastoral system owing to the windbreak effect of the eucalyptus trees the present study demonstrated that silvopastoral systems can be used to attenuate the effects of climate change as trees can protect pastureland from intense solar radiation and wind thereby reducing evapotranspiration and consequently improving soil water availability for the understory crop 2020 academia brasileira de ciencias all rights reserved,344
Expanding forest carbon sinks to mitigate climate change in Africa,forests significantly contribute to climate change mitigation by acting as carbon sinks sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide and keeping it in soil and biomass covering 22 of its land african forests offer numerous benefits to millions of people nevertheless they face threats from human activities like deforestation and degradation a holistic approach encompassing social economic and environmental factors is necessary to sustain forests as carbon sinks for maximum carbon sequestration potential this study used carbon dioxide emissions forest loss and gain and land use change to investigate the level of carbon dioxide emissions and their relationship to forest loss and climate change in africa from 1992 to 2020 using arcgis land use change was reclassified invest model calculated carbon storage and sequestration and annual changes in forest cover were assessed using the k and s indices in the last two decades 7736 of african countries had greater forest losses than gains leading to 32 103 kha net loss resulting in 1573 pg c of carbon dioxide emissions annual forest loss rate is 16 103 kha equivalent to 0786 pg c and that of carbon storage and sequestration decreased to 069 and 137 respectively results indicate that deforestation particularly in the democratic republic of the congo significantly contributes to carbon emissions and persistent tropical deforestation will affect future greenhouse gas concentrations this research provides a detailed spatiotemporal analysis highlighting areas experiencing severe forest cover change and carbon loss underscoring the importance of forest conservation in mitigating climate change and promoting effective land management policies 2024 the authors,345

Potential aboveground biomass increase in Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments with climate change,fragmented tropical forest landscapes preserve much of the remaining biodiversity and carbon stocks climate change is expected to intensify droughts and increase fire hazard and fire intensities thereby causing habitat deterioration and losses of biodiversity and carbon stock losses understanding the trajectories that these landscapes may follow under increased climate pressure is imperative for establishing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services here we used a quantitative predictive modelling approach to project the spatial distribution of the aboveground biomass density agb by the end of the 21st century across the brazilian atlantic forest af domain to develop the models we used the maximum entropy method with projected climate data to 2100 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway rcp 45 from the fifth assessment report our agb models had a satisfactory performance area under the curve 075 and p value 05 the models projected a significant increase of 85 in the total carbon stock overall the projections indicated that 769 of the af domain would have suitable climatic conditions for increasing biomass by 2100 considering the rcp 45 scenario in the absence of deforestation of the existing forest fragments 347 are projected to increase their agb while 26 are projected to have their agb reduced by 2100 the regions likely to lose most agbup to 40 compared to the baselineare found between latitudes 13 deg and 20 deg south overall although climate change effects on agb vary latitudinally for the 20712100 period under the rcp 45 scenario our model indicates that agb stocks can potentially increase across a large fraction of the af the patterns found here are recommended to be taken into consideration during the planning of restoration efforts as part of climate change mitigation strategies in the af and elsewhere in brazil,348
A decade of mangrove recovery at affected area by the 2004 tsunami along coast of Banda Aceh city,banda aceh ba is the capital of aceh province indonesia it was the most affected areas by the 2004 tsunami before the natural catastrophe most of the ba mangroves disturbed by human activities and remaining mangroves were fragmented and had a low density of trees therefore the objectives of this study were to calculate the impact of the tsunami on mangrove and subsequently to evaluate the mangrove recovery based on spatial and temporal analysis and ground truthing method within the period 11 years in intertidal areas of ba three regions of ba coastal areas were selected namely kuala cangkoy gampong jawa and lambada coasts before the tsunami the mangrove forests in ba were only 136 of ba coastlands and fragmented approximately 489 of the mangroves have destroyed due to the tsunami the ba mangroves at 5 and 11 years after tsunami were 665 and 813 relative to the data before tsunami respectively it means that the ba is very vulnerable due to the future tsunami occur therefore the mangrove restoration in ba needs to be improved and maintain based on green belt concept for coastal protection as well as productivity of estuarine ecosystem,349
Assessing mangrove restoration practices using species-interaction networks,mangroves are uniquely important ecosystems for preserving biodiversity sustaining livelihoods and mitigating against climate change however they are degraded globally and are therefore a priority for ecosystem restoration to date the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area thus more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both here we assessed the utility of using speciesinteraction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time we compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated monoculture reforestation mixed species regeneration and reference forest plots in two study areas in sulawesi indonesia an estuarine and a coastal fringe mangrove system we also combined and evaluated sampling methods utilizing traditional plantanimal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way we found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots with contrasting effects between the two sites our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics such as species richness were used alone with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning we also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing speciesinteraction networks overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species 2021 the authors restoration ecology published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of society for ecological restoration,350

Protecting an artificial savanna as a nature-based solution to restore carbon and biodiversity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,a large share of the global forest restoration potential is situated in artificial unstable mesic african savannas which could be restored to higher carbon and biodiversity states if protected from humaninduced burning however uncertainty on recovery rates in protected unstable savannas impedes scienceinformed forest restoration initiatives here we quantify the forest restoration success of anthropogenic fire exclusion within an 88ha mesic artificial savanna patch in the kongo central province of the democratic republic of the congo dr congo we found that aboveground carbon recovery after 17 years was on average 1140 085 mg c ha1 using a statistical model we found that aboveground carbon stocks take 112 3 years to recover to 90 of aboveground carbon stocks in oldgrowth forests assuming that this recovery trajectory would be representative for all unstable savannas we estimate that they could have a total carbon uptake potential of 1213 225 gt c by 2100 across dr congo congo and angola species richness recovered to 3317 after 17 years and we predicted a 90 recovery at 54 2 years in contrast we predicted that species composition would recover to 90 of oldgrowth forest composition only after 124 3 years we conclude that the relatively simple and costefficient measure of fire exclusion in artificial savannas is an effective naturebased solution to climate change and biodiversity loss however more longterm and in situ monitoring efforts are needed to quantify variation in longterm carbon and diversity recovery pathways particular uncertainties are spatial variability in socioeconomics and growing conditions as well as the effects of projected climate changefire exclusion in an artificial savanna in the dr congo resulted in rapid aboveground carbon recovery at 1140 085 mg c ha1 after 17 years and reaching 90 of aboveground carbon stocks in oldgrowth forests after 112 3 years species richness is predicted to recover even faster reaching 90 of oldgrowth values after 54 2 years we conclude that the relatively simple and costefficient measure of fire exclusion in artificial savannas is an effective naturebased solution to climate change and biodiversity loss but more longterm monitoring efforts are needed to quantify variation in recovery pathwaysimage,362
Soil Organic Matter Responses to Mangrove Restoration: A Replanting Experience in Northeast Brazil,mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon thus restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change therefore this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern brazilian coast were studied including a degraded mangrove dm recovering mangroves after 3 years 3y and 7 years 7y of planting and a mature mangrove mm the soil total organic carbon ct and soil carbon stocks scss were determined for each area additionally a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions the particle size distribution was also analyzed our results revealed significant differences in the scs and ct values between the dm 3y and 7y and the mm for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development however based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions such as low rates of carbon enrichment c recovery and low c content after hydrofluoric acid hf treatment being similar for the dm and the 3y and 7ythis indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution these results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions both to maintain their previous scs and increase it than mature mangroves conversely the mm appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the scs these results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions these findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios 2021 by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland,363

"Optimizing the spatial distribution of Southeast Asia mangrove restoration based on zonation, species and carbon projection schemes",mangroves contain large amounts of carbon that can reduce the effects of global climate change which is termed as blue carbon and noted as an important ecosystem service however mangrove ecosystems have experienced a huge decline due to human activities and any rehabilitation and restoration efforts should be undertaken with careful planning to optimise their ecosystem service provision and to improve the success of these programs the main objective of this study was to model a scenario specific to southeast asian mangrove distribution based on zonation species and coastal morphology as well as the estimation of future aboveground biomass carbon content resulting from multiple scenarios of successful mangrove growth this study provides the first assessment of the differences in the distribution of carbon content in a range of native mangrove species as well as the relationship between the number of propagules carbon content mangrove species and the percentage of living mangroves the potential location for mangrove planting was dominated by zone 4 inundated by spring high tides with a suitable area of 4081325 ha the next largest area was zone 2 inundated by medium high tides with a potential area of 2080475 ha followed by zone 3 inundated by normal high tides with an area of 1685800 ha this study is expected to serve as a reference for mangrove ecosystem conservation and optimisation of carbon storage especially in southeast asia,376
Formal designation of Brazilian indigenous lands linked to small but consistent reductions in deforestation,indigenous territories in brazil have existed since the preeuropean discovery of the continent yet many of them remain without formal recognition by the state while numerous studies discuss the social implications of indigenous land il designation limited empirical evidence exists regarding its role in forest conservation to address this gap the present study employs a quasiexperimental design and causalinference methods to estimate the effects of formal il designation on deforestation across brazil and its biomes from 1986 to 2021 estimates indicate an average impact of 005 on deforestation due to the formal designation of ils nationwide with variations ranging from 021 to 004 across different evaluation periods and biomes notably designated ils in the cerrado biome had the highest avoided deforestation impacts 012 on average no evidence of deforestation leakage was observed the findings from this study suggest that while the promotion of formal il designation can lead to consistent reductions in deforestation the magnitude of its effect is relatively small to be promoted on the sole basis of an effective strategy to mitigate tropical deforestation and climate change nevertheless the potential positive socioeconomic impacts of formal il designation on indigenous peoples cannot be undermined 2024 the author,377

Uncertainty in establishing forest reference levels and predicting future forest-based carbon stocks for REDD,forest reference levels frls provide a benchmark for assessing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd and they are central to demonstrate additionality of redd attaining realistic frls however is challenging especially in complex mosaic landscapes we established frls in northern laos for different reference periods and tested them against actual carbon stock changes annual time series of landsat satellite images were used to capture the subtle changes in carbon stocks in complex landscapes characterized by shifting cultivation we found that frls differ considerably depending on the reference period chosen abrupt landuse changes occurred when hybrid maize replaced traditional shifting cultivation and forests and this invalidated carbon stock trends that would have been predicted had the frl been projected into the future we conclude that demonstrating additionality of redd in fast developing areas is difficult and that payment systems rewarding potential emission reductions against hypothetical extrapolation of frls are unlikely to be a costeffective strategy,381

Functional identity explains carbon sequestration in a 77-year-old experimental tropical plantation,planting forests is an important practice for climate change mitigation especially in the tropics where the carbon c sequestration potential is high successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge of the role of species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations despite this need solid data on the longterm development of forest plantations are still very scarce monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77yearold tree diversity experiment in yangambi in the congo basin were fully inventoried we calculated aboveground c stocks using allometric equations and soil c stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks a high variability in aboveground c stocks across tree species combinations was observed apart from a species identity effect the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area bapl and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon agc with bapl being more important both agc and bapl were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species the planting of shortlived pioneers led to low agc we found no clear benefits but also no drawbacks for agc of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including nitrogen fixing species in the plantation scheme however the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth we conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks this was predominantly caused by large differences in agc sequestration over the past 77 years altogether shortlived pioneer species had a low bapl resulting in low carbon sequestration while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest agc stocks tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the agc stock given that the appropriate functional type is planted,387

Measurement of carbon dioxide flux from tropical peatland in Indonesia using the nocturnal temperature-inversion trap method,evaluation of co2 flux from peatland soil respiration is important to understand the effect of land use change on the global carbon cycle and climate change and particularly to support carbon emission reduction policies however quantitative estimation of emitted co2 fluxes in indonesia is constrained by existing field data current methods for co2 measurement are limited by high initial cost manpower and the difficulties associated with construction issues measurement campaigns were performed using a newly developed nocturnal temperatureinversion trap method which measures the amount of co2 trapped beneath the nocturnal inversion layer in the dry season of 2013 at a drained tropical peatland near palangkaraya central kalimantan indonesia this method is costeffective and data processing is easier than other flux estimation methods we compared co2 fluxes measured using this method with the published data from the existing eddy covariance and closed chamber methods the maximum value of our measurement results was 10 lower than maximum value of eddy covariance method and average value was 6 higher than average of chamber method in drained tropical peatlands in addition the measurement results shows good correlation with groundwater table the results of this comparison suggest that this methodology for the co2 flux measurement is useful for field research in tropical peatlands 2016 iop publishing ltd,389
Does the Establishment of Sustainable Use Reserves Affect Fire Management in the Humid Tropics?,tropical forests are experiencing a growing fire problem driven by climatic change agricultural expansion and forest degradation protected areas are an important feature of forest protection strategies and sustainable use reserves surs may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management however the use of fire in swidden agriculture and other forms of land management may be undermining the effectiveness of surs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals we analyse modis derived hot pixels trmm rainfall data terraclass land cover data socioecological data from the brazilian agrocensus and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of surs reduces fire occurrence in the brazilian amazon specifically we ask 1 a is sur location ie de facto or 1 b designation ie de jure the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires and 2 does sur creation affect fire management ie the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall we demonstrate that preprotection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance we show that reserve creation had no discernible impact on fire density and that fires were less prevalent in surs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness rather than their status de jure in addition the timing of fires in relation to rainfall indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law did not improve following sur creation these results challenge the notion that surs promote environmentally sensitive firemanagement and suggest that surs in amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves in addition to other fire users will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats 2016 carmenta et al this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited,390
Conservation value of cacao agroforestry for amphibians and reptiles in South-East Asia: combining correlative models with follow-up field experiments,although agricultural expansion is a primary threat to tropical biodiversity experimental studies evaluating the conservation value of tropical agricultural habitats are scarce in particular little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as southeast asia we used a twostep approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in sulawesi indonesia indonesia is the third largest cacaoexporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity we first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a bayesian model selection approach based on these results we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness llt number of branch piles logs and llt logs combinations in the cacao plots the experimental data were analysed using bayesian hierarchical regression the best supported correlative models incorporated llt logs air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity the subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness and reptile abundance but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way providing microhabitat resources however the main beneficiaries were common disturbancetolerant reptiles synthesis and applications the different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories this will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbancetolerant species which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal particularly for rare species native forests remain critical for herpetological richness the direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and hence demand further research 2009 british ecological society,391
Conservation slows down emission increase from a tropical peatland in Indonesia,tropical peatlands are threatened by climate change and landuse changes but there remain substantial uncertainties about their present and future role in the global carbon cycle due to limited measurements here we present measurements of carbon dioxide and methane emissions between mid2017 and mid2020 as well as nitrous oxide emissions between 2019 and 2020 at two contrasting sites at a coastal peatland in sumatra indonesia we find that greenhousegas emissions from intact peatland increased substantially due to an extreme drought caused by a positive indian ocean dipole phase combined with el nino the emission in the degraded site was two times greater than that at the intact site the smaller emission from the intact peatland suggests that protecting the remaining intact tropical peatlands from degradation offers important climate benefits avoiding greenhousegas emissions of 24 5 tco2e ha1 yr1 average standard deviation at our study site in indonesiaduring a period of drought an intact tropical peatland in indonesia released half the amount of greenhouse gases as was released from a degraded site according to a direct comparison of eddy covariance measurements at a pair of peatland sites in sumatra,392
Recovery of dung beetle assemblages in regenerating Caatinga dry forests following slash-and-burn agriculture,understanding patterns of tropical forest resilience is a central challenge in conservation ecology particularly in seasonallydry tropical forests where anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are pervasive threats here we investigate the recovery rate and community organization of dung beetles along a caatinga dry forest regeneration cline in the context of slashandburn agriculture in northeast brazil assemblages were described considering a wide set of attributes including abundance taxonomic hill orders d0 d1 and d2 and functional diversity functional richness evenness and redundancy and taxonomicfunctional composition across a chronosequence consisting of regenerating and oldgrowth forest stands exposed to different levels of aridity and chronic disturbance in addition we use body mass diet food relocation behaviour and habitat specificity of dung beetles as ecological attributes our results show that caatinga dry forests supports dense but relatively impoverished dung beetle assemblages at both local and landscape scales with the same small set of species dominating local assemblages dung beetles do not experience successional replacements along the regeneration gradient with evidence of high resilience moreover disturbanceassociated dung beetle species predominantly smallbodied generalists resulted in assemblage convergence across the regeneration cline finally chronic anthropogenic disturbance was a decisive driver of changes in abundance and taxonomic diversity while aridity positively affected species composition and functional richness these patterns resulted in the occurrence of spatially structured assemblages in response to a combination of both natural and anthropogenic variables while under little or no influence of forest regeneration status across humanmodified caatinga landscapes we conclude that the absence of directional changes in dung beetle assemblages through the forest succession pathway of regenerating secondgrowth forest is associated with the effect of aridity and human disturbances on community organization including selection for certain species and functional groups which in turn can alter important ecological functions and consequently the resilience of dry forests,393
Carbon payments as a safeguard for threatened tropical mammals,one reason for the rapid loss of speciesrich tropical forests is the high opportunity costs of forest protection in kalimantan indonesian borneo the expansion of highrevenue oil palm elaeis guineensis plantations currently threatens 33 million ha of forest we estimate that payments for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd could offset the costs of stopping this deforestation at carbon prices of us 1033 per tonne of co2 or 216 per tonne if forest conservation targets only costefficient areas forty globally threatened mammals are found within these planned plantations including the bornean orangutan pongo pygmaeus and borneo pygmy elephant elephas maximus borneensis costefficient areas for emissions reductions also contain higherthanaverage numbers of threatened mammals indicating that there may be synergies between mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity while many policy and implementation issues need clarification our economic assessment suggests that redd could offer a financially realistic lifeline for kalimantans threatened mammals if it is included in future climate agreements,394

Beyond trees: Mapping total aboveground biomass density in the Brazilian savanna using high-density UAV-lidar data,tropical savanna ecosystems play a major role in the seasonality of the global carbon cycle however their ability to store and sequester carbon is uncertain due to combined and intermingling effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change which impact wildfire regimes and vegetation dynamics accurate measurements of tropical savanna vegetation aboveground biomass agb over broad spatial scales are crucial to achieve effective carbon emission mitigation strategies uavlidar is a new remote sensing technology that can enable rapid 3d mapping of structure and related agb in tropical savanna ecosystems this study aimed to assess the capability of highdensity uavlidar to estimate and map total tree shrubs and surface layers aboveground biomass density agbt in the brazilian savanna cerrado five ordinary least square regression models estimating agbt were adjusted using 50 field sample plots 30 m 30 m the best model was selected under akaike information criterion adjusted coefficient of determination adjr2 absolute and relative root mean square error rmse and used to map agbt from uavlidar data collected over 1854 ha spanning the three major vegetation formations forest savanna and grassland in cerrado the model using vegetation height and cover was the most effective with an overall model adjr2 of 079 and a leaveoneout crossvalidated rmse of 1911 mgha 3340 the uncertainty and errors of our estimations were assessed for each vegetation formation separately resulting in rmses of 2708 mgha 2599 for forests 1776 mgha 4396 for savannas and 772 mgha 4492 for grasslands these results prove the feasibility and potential of the uavlidar technology in cerrado but also emphasize the need for further developing the estimation of biomass in grasslands of high importance in the characterization of the global carbon balance and for supporting integrated fire management activities in tropical savanna ecosystems our results serve as a benchmark for future studies aiming to generate accurate biomass maps and provide baseline data for efficient management of fire and predicted climate change impacts on tropical savanna ecosystems 2021 elsevier bv,400
Opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tropical peatlands,the upcoming global mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries should include and prioritize tropical peatlands forested tropical peatlands in southeast asia are rapidly being converted into production systems by introducing perennial crops for lucrative agribusiness such as oilpalm and pulpwood plantations causing large greenhouse gas ghg emissions the intergovernmental panel on climate change guidelines for ghg inventory on agriculture forestry and other land uses provide an adequate framework for emissions inventories in these ecosystems however specific emission factors are needed for more accurate and costeffective monitoring the emissions are governed by complex biophysical processes such as peat decomposition and compaction nutrient availability soil water content and water table level all of which are affected by management practices we estimate that total carbon loss from converting peat swamp forests into oil palm is 594 102 mg of co2 per hectare per year during the first 25 y after landuse cover change of which 616 arise from the peat of the total amount 1486 183 mg of co2 per hectare over 25 y 25 are released immediately from landclearing fire in order to maintain high palmoil production nitrogen inputs through fertilizer are needed and the magnitude of the resulting increased n2o emissions compared to co2 losses remains unclear,401

"The Interplay Between Carbon Storage, Productivity, and Native Tree Density of Agroforestry Systems",agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production a greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty in this study we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in bali indonesiarustic where a native tree canopy is still present and polyculture where all native trees have been removed and the canopy consists only of cropping trees we then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems we found that the primary forest 27796 14905 mg c ha1 stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic 14472 18814 mg c ha1 or polyculture 10512 4865 mg c ha1 agroforestry systems which were not significantly different from each other we found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system we also found that for the rustic system an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage but no significant change in productivity consequently we conclude that within the rustic system carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity 2025 by the authors,403
Monitoring the effect of restoration measures in Indonesian peatlands by radar satellite imagery,in the context of the ongoing climate change discussions the importance of peatlands as carbon stores is increasingly recognised in the public drainage deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential the blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes this study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures the study area is the former mega rice project area in central kalimantan indonesia where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense restoration measures started in july 2004 by building 30 large dams until june 2008 we applied change detection analysis with more than 80 envisat asar and alos palsar images acquired between 2004 and 2009 radar signal increases of up to 136 db show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams furthermore a strong correlation between crosspolarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above 50 cm was found monitoring peatland rewetting and quantifying groundwater level variations is important information for vegetation reestablishment fire hazard warning and making carbon emission mitigation tradable under the voluntary carbon market or redo reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation mechanism c 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,404
Contribution of agroforests to landscape carbon storage,while many studies have measured the carbon c stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level their contribution to overall landscape c storage has rarely been quantified here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape c storage and thus climate change mitigation focusing on the cocoa theobroma cacao agroforests locally known as cabrucas of southern bahia brazil using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms 6 mature forests 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows we calculate average aboveground c stocks of 87 and 46mgha1 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests respectively 183mgha1 in oldgrowth forests 102mgha1 in disturbed forests and 33mgha1 in fallows based on the most recent land cover data available we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 of the total aboveground c stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape while forests hold 32 and fallows hold 9 carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over onehalf of those of traditional agroforests indicating a threat to landscape c stocks from current land use trends we show that in agroforests as in natural forests c stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees this suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees is possible without greatly affecting their c storage if large trees are conserved in order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climatefriendly solutions we suggest that biodiversity and crich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd andor their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms 2013 springer sciencebusiness media dordrecht,405

Sustainable Production of Robusta Coffee under a Changing Climate: A 10-Year Monitoring of Fertilizer Management in Coffee Farms in Vietnam and Indonesia,assessing and prescribing fertilizer use is critical to profitable and sustainable coffee production and this is becoming a priority concern for the robusta coffee industry in this study annual survey data of 798 farms across selected robusta coffeeproducing provinces in vietnam and indonesia between 2008 and 2017 were used to comparatively assess the fertilizer management strategies in these countries specifically we aimed to characterize fertilizer use patterns in the key coffeegrowing provinces and discuss the potential for improving nutrient management practices four types of chemical npk super phosphate potassium chloride and urea and two of natural compost and lime fertilizers were routinely used in vietnam in indonesia npk and urea were supplemented only with compost farmers in vietnam applied unbalanced quantities of chemical fertilizers ie higher rates than recommended and at a constant rate between years whereas indonesian farmers applied well below the recommended rates because of poor accessibility and financial support the overuse of chemical fertilizers in vietnam threatens the sustainability of robusta coffee farming nevertheless there is a potential for improvement in both countries in terms of nutrient management and sustainability of robusta coffee production by adopting the best local fertilizer management practices,420
"Carbon stocks, emissions, and aboveground productivity in restored secondary tropical peat swamp forests",tropical wetlands such as peat swamp forests psfs have been known globally as one of the carbon crich ecosystems however there is still a lack of understanding on the c cycle in psfs especially in association with land use and cover changes eg ecosystem degradation and restoration this study presents the c stocks removals and emissions dataset as well as the determining factors from an early restoration stage of secondary tropical psfs in central kalimantan we assessed various biophysical parameters such as forest structure above and belowground cstocks aboveground primary productivity total and heterotrophic soil respirations and groundwater level gwl we found that tree density varied from 1200 to 1825 trees per hectare ha across the plots whereas the mean of stand basal area was 3286 472m2ha1 mean ecosystem c stocks in the study site was 1752 401mgcha1 of which 93 was stored in belowground organic peat soils a mean aboveground litterfall production of 46 05mgcha1year1 and biomass c sequestration through tree diameter increment with 27 05mgcha1year1 was obtained we observed slightly larger portion of annual mean total soil respiration with 142 11mgcha1year1 than heterotrophic respiration 111 09mgcha1year1 emphasizing the lower contribution of autotrophic respiration from the belowground rooting system findings imply that further conservation management efforts through ecosystem restoration may preserve c stored and enhance c input in psfs substantially and could be potentially included in national climate change mitigation strategies 2018 springer sciencebusiness media bv part of springer nature,421
Identification of Tropical Peatland Using ALOS 2 Palsar,in indonesia a huge amount of peat has accumulated under peat swamp forest over millennia however a repeatable largescale fire as a result of land clearing has rapidly devastated these tropical peatlands these disturbances eg climate change deforestation peatland drainage forest and peatland fires and land conversion change the ecosystem respiration and resulting a high carbon emitted to the atmosphere to restore the peatland ecosystem indonesia government makes a special force by using three activities namely rewetting replantation and communal empowerment these activities need an accurate peatland monitoring however accessing the spatial variation of the peatland is quite limited difficult and laborious therefore we investigated the existence of tropical peatland in siak riau province indonesia we measured soil moisture at four different types of land cover namely forest oil palm shrubs and agriculture a long with two types of peat conditions we estimated the constanta dielectric values obtained from a fully polarimetry for alos 2 palsar results indicated that the of oil palm was lower in nonpeat area than in peat area whereas the decrease in probably in peat area resulted from the rapid growth of oil palm published under licence by iop publishing ltd,422
Multiple drivers influence tree species diversity and above-ground carbon stock in second-growth Atlantic forests: Implications for the passive restoration,secondgrowth forests sgf are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation however these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting and in highly humanmodified landscapes these interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration for this we used data from 37 sgf growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the brazilian atlantic forest after the last cut cycle for each sgf the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the hills number and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock then we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes soil properties pastmanagement intensity patch configuration and landscape composition little influence of soil properties was found only soil fertility negatively influenced aboveground carbon stock however pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock the isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance 500 ha also negatively influenced the diversity of species this is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly humanmodified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes less dependent on animal dispersal and have low carbon stock capacity thus areas with higher pastmanagement intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the atlantic forest the approach which had not yet been applied in the atlantic forest brought similar results to that found in other forests and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome,423

The dynamics of variations in carbon biomass in community forest and agroforestry in South Sulawesi,knowledge of the variation of potential carbon stocks in different types of forests provides information about the capabilities of each forest type in dealing with climate change mitigation this research was conducted to determine the dynamics of carbon stocks in gofasa plantation community forests and compared to other land use systems in south sulawesi the research used sample plots 20 m x 50 m to measure tree biomass and 1 m x 1 m sub plots for undergrowth and litter the results of the study indicated that there were variations of potential carbon stocks in plantation community forests and agroforestry carbon stocks in plantation community forest were varied according to the condition and age of forest stand the total aboveground carbon stocks in homogenous gofasa stand ranged from 2234 to 5265 tonha by the difference in stand ages while in mixed community forest was 7760 tonha as for agroforestry system the carbon stocks ranged from 4640 to 6589 tonha the dynamics of variations in carbon stocks in plantation community forest and agroforestry were determined by several variables such as species composition stand age and stand density therefore a good management of community forests and agroforestry systems will ensure the mitigation of climate changes and environmental preservation through effective carbon storage,442
"High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia",mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats capitalising on this potential however remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in tiwoho north sulawesi indonesia estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the verified carbon standard additionally net emissions removals and reductions from tiwoho is scaledup to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation we also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs our data indicates that on average tiwohos rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of 276 17 mg co2e per hectare per year this is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and assuming a voluntary carbon market price of usd 81 per mg co2e per hectare for afforestationreforestation projects equates to recuperation of 762 of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 76 this return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the 600 000 hectares of disused ponds in indonesia may offset upwards of 1656 102 million mg co2e per hectare per year additionally mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of regrowth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon these findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector 2019 elsevier bv,443
"Simulating soil C dynamics under intensive agricultural systems and climate change scenarios in the Matopiba region, Brazil",the recent agricultural expansion in the matopiba region brazils new agricultural frontier has raised questions about the risk of increasing soil organic carbon soc loss as large areas of native vegetation nv ie cerrado biome have been replaced by largescale mechanized agriculture although sustainable managements such as integrated croplivestock icl systems are considered strategic to counterbalance the soc loss associated with landuse change luc while keeping food production little is known about their longterm effects on soc stocks in the matopiba region to this end we used the daycent model to simulate the effects of converting the management commonly used in this region ie soybeancotton rotation under notillage nt into icl systems with distinct levels of intensification eg crop rotations soybeanpasture and soybeanpasturecotton soil and crop management grass irrigation scarificationharrowing and length of grass cultivation on long term soc dynamics additionally data from two projected climate scenarios ssp245 greenhouse gases emissions ghg will not change markedly over time and global temperature will increase by 20 degrees c by 2060 and ssp585 marked changes in ghg emissions are expected to occur resulting in an increase of 24 and 44 degrees c in global temperature in the middle and at the end of the century were included in our simulations to evaluate climate change effects on soc dynamics in this region based on a 50yrtime frame simulation we observed that soc stocks under icl systems were on average 23 and 47 higher than in the nv 369 mg ha 1 and soybean cotton rotation under nt 309 mg ha 1 respectively growing grasses interlaid with crops was crucial to increase soc stocks even when disruptive soil practices were followed although the irrigation of grass resulted in an early increase of soc stocks and a higher pasture stoking rate it did not increase soc stocks in the long term compared to nonirrigated treatments the ssp245 and ssp585 climate scenarios had little effects on soc dynamics in the simulated icl systems however additional soc loss 0065 mg ha 1 yr 1 is predicted to occur if the current management is not improved these findings can help guide management decisions for the matopiba region brazil to alleviate the anthropogenic pressure associated with agriculture development more broadly they confirm that croplivestock integration in croplands is a successful strategy to regenerate soc,444
Evaluation of soil organic matter from integrated production systems using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy,agricultural areas under integrated production systems such as integrated croplivestockforest system clfs have the potential to sequestrate carbon c since both soil organic matter som content and trees biomass increase thus mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs from agriculture regarding soil aspects the c content stands out as the main indicator but the structural aspect of som is also relevant since it plays a key role in the chemical stability of c compounds and the soil lifetime of c compounds laserinduced fluorescence spectroscopy lifs is an effective technique to evaluate the som humification index hlifs from practically intact whole soil samples under different agricultural systems thus the objective of this study was to analyze the som humification index in different integrated systems such as integrated croplivestockforest system clfs integrated livestockforest system lfs integrated croplivestock system cls and in references areas such as intensive pasture int extensive pasture ext and native forest nf for this purpose samples of redyellow latosol haplorthox by soil taxonomy from the experimental site located at embrapa pecu aria sudeste southeast of brazil were collected five years after the establishment of the integrated systems samples were collected at soil depths of 05 510 1020 2030 3040 4060 6080 and 80100 cm pellets of the whole soil samples were prepared for lifs analysis in these areas som humification indices hlifs presented the following descending order cls ext int lfs clfs nf previous results have shown a greater soil organic carbon stock in these integrated production systems than in the nf area suggesting c sequestration in agricultural soil in the present study som was classified by lifs as more chemically stable in integrated production systems than in native vegetation higher amounts of fluorescent compounds were identified from lifs data probably resulting from condensed aromatic groups som with more recalcitrant groups normally has a longer lifetime in the soil indicating a longterm contribution to mitigating climate change by avoiding fast som decomposition and co2 return to the atmosphere also for the first time this study was able to identify a positive correlation r 079 between the som humification index hlifs and the cation exchange capacity cecc content ratio of whole soil samples another innovative contribution from soil lifs analyses,445
An integrated greenhouse gas assessment of an alternative to slash-and-burn agriculture in eastern Amazonia,fires set for slashandburn agriculture contribute to the current unsustainable accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases and they also deplete the soil of essential nutrients which compromises agricultural sustainability at local scales integrated assessments of greenhouse gas emissions have compared intensive cropping systems in industrialized countries but such assessments have not been applied to common cropping systems of smallholder farmers in developing countries we report an integrated assessment of greenhouse gas emissions in slashandburn agriculture and an alternative chopandmulch system in the amazon basin the soil consumed atmospheric methane ch4 under slashandburn treatment and became a net emitter of ch4 to the atmosphere under the mulch treatment mulching also caused about a 50 increase in soil emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide and required greater use of fertilizer and fuel for farm machinery despite these significantly higher emissions of greenhouse gases during the cropping phase under the alternative chopandmulch system calculated pyrogenic emissions in the slashandburn system were much larger especially for ch4 the global warming potential co2equivalent emissions calculated for the entire crop cycles were at least five times lower in chopandmulch compared with slashandburn the crop yields were similar for the two systems while economic and logistical considerations remain to be worked out for alternatives to slashandburn these results demonstrate a potential winwin strategy for maintaining soil fertility and reducing net greenhouse gas emissions thus simultaneously contributing to sustainability at both spatial scales,446
Yield Gap Management under Seawater Intrusion Areas of Indonesia to Improve Rice Productivity and Resilience to Climate Change,the purpose of this study was to evaluate a the performance of two modern rice varieties nontolerant and tolerant for saline soils under different fertilizer management options and b assess the yield gap and income increase through proper crop and nutrient management at different levels of soil salinity experiments were carried out in moderate and high levels of soil salinity in west java indonesia a split plot design with three replications was used the main plots included two rice varieties inpari30 ciherang sub1 and inpari34 tolerant variety for saline soils and subplots included eight fertilizer management treatments farmer participatory field trials were also established across three levels of soil salinity with four different rice varieties sidenuk inpari 30 inpari 34 and inpari 35 and a fertilizer package consisting of organic and inorganic fertilizers under low and moderate soil salinities sidenuk and inpari 30 with recommended practice had higher productivity and economic benefit compared to the saline tolerant rice varieties inpari 34 and inpari 35 however under high soil salinity the yields of inpari 34 and inpari 35 with recommended practice were 93 higher than farmers practice representing an exploitable yield gap of 13 t ha1 and benefit above fertilizer cost of usd 301 ha1 the combination of tolerant varieties and improved nutrient management use for rice production can therefore be used as a strategy for improving farmers income and livelihoods in coastal areas of indonesia 2019 by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland,447
Impact of industrial logging concession on deforestation and forest degradation in the DRC,the congo basin is home to the second largest tropical humid forest in the world and an important participant in climate change mitigation while the democratic republic of congo drc boasts the largest proportion of congo basin forests it is also the main contributor to forest loss industrial logging concession is a forest management model that is likely to expand in the drc in the coming years as the government recently announced the probable end of the 2002 moratorium on logging concessions it is thus crucial to understand whether this model can further the drcs deforestation reduction efforts the literature suggests that the effect of titling forestland on avoided deforestation and forest degradation is generally limited unless environmental restrictions are enforced the drcs 2002 forest code introduced a new logging concession model that includes requirements to submit and implement forest management plans fmp and increase benefitsharing with communities our paper evaluates the impact of this new model of concession contracts signed in 2011 and 2014 on deforestation and forest degradation we use remotely sensed data series to estimate differenceindifference models we ensured baseline parallel trends in deforestation and similarity in baseline characteristics between control and treated units we find no evidence that deforestation and forest degradation is significantly different between logging concessions and control areas even for concessions that had their fmp accepted our study highlights the need for evaluating the impact of fmps once they are fully implemented the importance to improve degradation outcome variables and to conduct complementary studies analyzing impact pathways 2023 elsevier ltd,448
Predictive Models to Estimate Carbon Stocks in Agroforestry Systems,this study aims to assess the carbon stock in a pasture area and fragment of forest in natural regeneration given the importance of agroforestry systems in mitigating gas emissions which contribute to the greenhouse effect as well as promoting the maintenance of agricultural productivity our other goal was to predict the carbon stock according to different land use systems from physical and chemical soil variables using the random forest algorithm we carried out our study at an entisols quartzipsamments area with a completely randomized experimental design four treatments and six replites the treatments consisted of the following i an agroforestry system developed for livestock ii an agroforestry system developed for fruit culture iii a conventional pasture and iv a forest fragment deformed and undeformed soil samples were collected in order to analyze their physical and chemical properties across two consecutive agricultural years the response variable carbon stock was subjected to a boxplot analysis and all the databases were used for a predictive modeling which in turn used the random forest algorithm results led to the conclusion that the agroforestry systems developed both for fruit culture and livestock are more efficient at stocking carbon in the soil than the pasture area and forest fragment undergoing natural regeneration nitrogen stock and land use systems are the most important variables to estimate carbon stock from the physical and chemical variables of soil using the random forest algorithm the predictive models generated from the physical and chemical variables of soil as well as the random forest algorithm presented a high potential for predicting soil carbon stock and are sensitive to different land use systems,449
Land-Based Mitigation Strategies under the Mid-Term Carbon Reduction Targets in Indonesia,we investigated the key mitigation options for achieving the midterm target for carbon emission reduction in indonesia a computable general equilibrium model coupled with a landbased mitigation technology model was used to evaluate specific mitigation options within the whole economic framework the results revealed three primary findings 1 if no climate policy were implemented indonesias total greenhouse gas emissions would reach 30 gtco2eq by 2030 2 to reduce carbon emissions to meet the latest intended nationallydetermined contributions indc target 58 of total reductions should come from the agriculture forestry and other land use sectors by implementing forest protection afforestation and plantation efforts 3 a higher carbon price in 2020 suggests that meeting the 2020 target would be economically challenging whereas the indc target for 2030 would be more economically realistic in indonesia 2016 by the author,450

The potential of natural shade provided by Brazilian savanna trees for thermal comfort and carbon sink,this study looked at the potential of thermal comfort provided to animals by four different brazilian savanna cerrado native trees as well as their potential for carbon sink the evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020 which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables the mean radiant temperature tmr degrees c was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees and from that the radiant heat load rhl w m2 was calculated as an index of thermal comfort solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct diffuse and reflected components w m2 and carbon stock from trees biomass for co2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native cerrado tree species the shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals with an average reduction respectively equal to 13 degrees c and 64 degrees c this represents a significant difference compared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species p 005 reflecting in lower values of tmr and rhl in the shaded area provided by each species carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 885 mg per tree these results demonstrate the great potential for native tree species in the cerrado biome to be used in agroforestry systems to provide higher levels of thermal comfort to animals and to combat climate change through their aptitude of co2 sink,452
Fast recovery of soil macrofauna in regenerating forests of the Amazon,the emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem we investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50years as reference we surveyed the number diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in brazilian amazon covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from landsat images in forests up to 30years old we used regression analysis to determine a the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30years old and b the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests up to 10years old median age forests between 10 and 30years old and forests older than 50years we found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10years of forest regrowth but show slower change among older forests this rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions therefore globalscale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow 2021 the authors journal of animal ecology published by john wiley sons ltd on behalf of british ecological society,453
Araguaia biodiversity corridor cost benefit analysis: Large scale restoration and sustainable agribusiness in Amazon and Cerrado,ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change but can be very costly this paper focuses on the costbenefit and costeffectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the araguaia biodiversity corridor brazil following the brazilian forest code regulation we analyze two paths for recovery ecological and economic including timber and agroforestry systems we consider the direct and indirect local costs as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion according to our estimates in 50 years the recovery of the araguaia corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological us 198 billion or economic us 189 billion pathways in all macroregions north central and south and rural property sizes small medium and large the recovery captures 262 million tco2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path these estimates are 23 and 17 higher respectively when using the ecological path importantly we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed additionally this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems especially in small farms there are also relevant local impacts from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services carbon and soil we show that social benefits from the araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration in this sense land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support grants or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region 2024 elsevier ltd,454
"Synthesizing Global and Local Datasets to Estimate Jurisdictional Forest Carbon Fluxes in Berau, Indonesia",backgroundforest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of subnational jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services we see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions we demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the regency of berau in eastern borneo indonesia our method integrates best available global and local datasets and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scaleprincipal findings and significancewe find that berau generated 891 199 million tonnes of net co2 emissions per year during 20002010 berau is an early frontier landscape where gross emissions are 12 times higher than gross sequestration yet most 85 of beraus original forests are still standing the majority of net emissions were due to conversion of native forests to unspecified agriculture 43 of total oil palm 28 and fiber plantations 9 most of the remainder was due to legal commercial selective logging 17 our overall uncertainty estimate offers an independent basis for assessing three other estimates for berau two other estimates were above the upper end of our uncertainty range we emphasize the importance of including an uncertainty range for all parameters of the emissions equation to generate a comprehensive uncertainty estimatewhich has not been done before we believe comprehensive estimates of carbon flux uncertainty are increasingly important as national and international institutions are challenged with comparing alternative estimates and identifying a credible range of historic emissions values,455
Tree-crop interactions and their environmental and economic implications in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments,the growing emphasis on marketbased solutions to environmental problems both under and outside of the united nations framework convention on climate change means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value if the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough this may alter the economics of growing trees which is often not an attractive landuse alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues in this paper the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a treecrop agroforest in indonesia using a simulationmodelling approach an economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder the simulation is implemented in wanulcas a model that accounts for water nutrients light and carbon in agroforestry systems the value of switching from a continuouscropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at 109 ha1 in present value terms although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs the optimal management regime both with and without carbon payments was to plant 15 of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewoodharvest regime with 75 of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients approximately 22 of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78 were attributed to improvements in land productivity the paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management 2004 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,456
Indigenous Burning as Conservation Practice: Neotropical Savanna Recovery amid Agribusiness Deforestation in Central Brazil,international efforts to address climate change by reducing tropical deforestation increasingly rely on indigenous reserves as conservation units and indigenous peoples as strategic partners considered winwin situations where global conservation measures also contribute to cultural preservation such alliances also frame indigenous peoples in diverse ecological settings with the responsibility to offset global carbon budgets through fire suppression based on the presumed positive value of nonalteration of tropical landscapes anthropogenic fire associated with indigenous ceremonial and collective hunting practices in the neotropical savannas cerrado of central brazil is routinely represented in public and scientific conservation discourse as a cause of deforestation and increased co2 emissions despite a lack of supporting evidence we evaluate this claim for the xavante people of pimentel barbosa indigenous reserve brazil building upon 23 years of longitudinal interdisciplinary research in the area we used multitemporal spatial analyses to compare land cover change under indigenous and agribusiness management over the last four decades 19732010 and quantify the contemporary xavante burning regime contributing to observed patterns based on a four year sample at the end of this sequence 20072010 the overall proportion of deforested land remained stable inside the reserve 06 but increased sharply outside 15 to 260 vegetation recovery occurred where reserve boundary adjustments transferred lands previously deforested by agribusiness to indigenous management periodic traditional burning by the xavante had a large spatial distribution but repeated burning in consecutive years was restricted our results suggest a need to reassess overreaching conservation narratives about the purported destructiveness of indigenous anthropogenic fire in the cerrado the real challenge to conservation in the fireadapted cerrado biome is the longterm sustainability of indigenous lands and other tropical conservation islands increasingly subsumed by agribusiness expansion rather than the localized subsistence practices of indigenous and other traditional peoples,457
Towards the reference ecosystems for quartzitic campo rupestre: Floristic composition and soil relationships,the loss and fragmentation of tropical habitats especially extreme megadiverse environments like the campo rupestre rupestrian grassland impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to millions of people the campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the cerrado biome a center of endemism in brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions however this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace thus understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity in this work for the first time we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic rocky outcrop stony grassland sandy grassland and peat bog a total of 12000 m2 of shrub layer 120 plots of 10 10 m and 120 m2 120 plots of 1 1 m of herbaceous layer were sampled we recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats furthermore we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multiregional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project this study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types 2024,458
"Effects of residual biochar amendment on soil chemical properties, nutrient uptake, crop yield and N2O emissions reduction in acidic upland rice of East Lampung",previous studies have been recognized that biochar addition to poor soil may lead to improve soil and crop productivity also reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions however the results were varied and the mechanisms were not clear two rates of rice husk rh and cacao shell cs biochar namely 0 and 15 t ha1 were applied to soil to investigate the effect of rh and cs biochar on soil chemical properties nutrient uptake crop yield and n2o emissions reduction on upland rice at acidic soil of east lampung it was residual effect study biochar was applied only in the first planting season of 2012 in addition n2o emissions from the soil were monitored with close chamber method the result showed that 15 t ha1 cs biochar treatment was the best treatment resulted 121 t ha1yield meanwhile on 15 t ha1 rh biochar treatment was only 022 t ha1 however no significance difference on both nutrient uptake and n2o emissions among the treatments n2o emissions from rh and cs biochar treatment were reduced 26 and 21 compare to control our result proposed that cs biochar may use as soil amendment to improve crop productivity and also to combat climate change,459
Effects of agricultural management and of climate change on N2O emissions in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado: Measurements and simulations using the STICS soil-crop model,soilplant simulation models have been ever more used as predictive tools to evaluate productivity and environmental impacts of agriculture practices the aims of this work were to evaluate the stics models capacity of simulate the emissions of nitrous oxide n2o under different management systems and to predict by applying the calibrated and validated stics model the n2o emissions under different management systems in the edaphoclimatic conditions of the brazilian cerrado the study was conducted in a longterm experiment at embrapa cerrados located in planaltinadf brazil the experiment started in 1995 the following land use systems were evaluated ct conventional tillage with disc harrow and biannual grasslegume rotation nt1 notillage with biannual crop rotation soybeansorghum nt2 notillage with biannual crop rotation maizepigeon peaclosed static chambers and gas sample analysis by gas chromatography were used to measure n2o fluxes the model was calibrated with the data measured in the ct and nt1 treatments the attributes used in the calibration were growth development and yield of crops and n2o fluxes to test the model data from the nt2 treatment was used data for all treatments were collected at the same time after calibration and validation the stics model was used to predict the effects of soil management systems conventional ct and notillage nt on greenhouse gas emissions and on grain and biomass crops production the simulation was made for the period from 2021 to 2070 the stics model performed well at simulation of the following parameters n2o emissions soil water dynamics soil temperature and leaf area aerial biomass and grain yield of soybean and maize the performance of the model was good for the conventional soil management system as well as in the notillage system based on the predicted increase in temperature for the period 20212070 we can conclude from the data generated through the stics model that there is strong evidence that grain yield and total aerial biomass of plants will decrease the data show that there is a rising tendency in n2o emissions over the simulated period this is expected to occur for the two soil management systems studied nt and ct we believe this increase in emissions along the years is related to temperature increase and to the reduction of crop cycle 2023 elsevier bv,460

Locating REDD: A global survey and analysis of REDD readiness and demonstration activities,mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation reddredd have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics in 2007 the conference of parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change called upon parties and international organizations to promote redd through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities this prompted many new actors to become involved in redd activities at a variety of locations and scales a global survey of redd activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities existing compilations literature review webbased sources facetoface and telephone interviews and email questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory inter alia data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model poisson of factors affecting the number of redd activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation the results show that there were at least 79 redd readiness activities and 100 redd demonstration activities as of october 2009 of these the largest shares of redd readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in indonesia 7 and 15 respectively and brazil 4 and 13 respectively countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forestbased emissions the statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statisticallysignificant effect on the number of redd readiness activities but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of redd demonstration projects baseline co2 emissions forest carbon stock number of threatened species quality of governance and region all had significant effects the results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land the results also reveal a bias against africa and toward latin america unless this pattern is countered redd and redd may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support c 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,462
[Biodiversity in a carbon sink.],in 1998 peugeot and the french forestry office office national des forets onf launched a carbon sink project in brazil in the north of the mato grosso planting began in 1999 over an area of 2 500 ha which had been used as pasture by the previous owner the main objective of the plantation was to fix maximum quantities of carbon while preserving the areas biodiversity and local development potential the species planted were mostly native and chosen for their success rates and their environmental and market value effects on the local environment are monitored as part of the project a specific method was developed to monitor carbon flows by comparing the projects carbon budget with the budget in the reference scenario which represents the situation had the project not taken place as well as testing technical schemes for a plantation of mixed native species the pilot project also provides opportunities for fieldwork on carbon sink monitoring methods as required under the kyoto protocol the project does not aim to provide peugeot with carbon credits but should produce useful new data for other projects stemming from the clean development mechanism,463
A new data-driven map predicts substantial undocumented peatland areas in Amazonia,tropical peatlands are among the most carbondense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded collectively they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle with wideranging estimates of their global area 441 0251700 000 km2 and belowground carbon storage 105288 pg c substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions including most of tropical south america here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first fielddatadriven model of peatland distribution across the amazon basin our model predicts a total amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 95th percentile confidence interval 128 671373 359 greater than that of the congo basin but around 30 smaller than a recent modelderived estimate of peatland area across amazonia the model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high particularly in parts of brazil and bolivia for example we predict significant peatland areas in northern peru with relatively high confidence while peatland areas in the rio negro basin and adjacent southwestern orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold campinarana or white sand forests are predicted with greater uncertainty similarly we predict large areas of peatlands in bolivia surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling this new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts which is likely to vary spatially across the amazon basin 2024 the authors published by iop publishing ltd,464
What is the impact of pasture reform on organic carbon compartments and CO2 emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado?,the emission of co2 from the soil in agricultural areas is the result of the interaction of several factors including soil and crop management practices and local edaphoclimatic conditions the dynamics of organic carbon oc in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability quality or decomposition capacity this study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating co2 emissions the study was carried out in the municipality of selvria mato grosso do sul brazil in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing subsidized by the forage plant urochloa brizantha cv marandu geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil the results indicated that soil management practices followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with u brizantha increased the total oc toc stocks through the stable fraction oc associated with the mineral fraction and consequent reduction in co2 emissions from the soil this highlights the spatial variability in co2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of co2 into the atmosphere the use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast co2 emissions from the soil this smallscale study provides a theoretical basis for the largescale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control co2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems particularly in degraded pasture areas 2020 elsevier bv,465
"The large Amazonian peatland carbon sink in the subsiding Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin, Peru",the carbon c dynamics of tropical peatlands can be of global importance because particularly in southeast asia they are the source of considerable amounts of c released to the atmosphere as a result of landuse change and fire in contrast the existence of tropical peatlands in amazonia has been documented only recently according to a recent study the 120 000 km2 subsiding pastazamaranon foreland basin in peruvian amazonia harbours previously unstudied and up to 75 m thick peat deposits we studied the role of these peat deposits as a c reserve and sink by measuring peat depth radiocarbon age and peat and c accumulation rates at 513 sites the basal ages varied from 1975 to 8870 cal yr bp peat accumulation rates from 046 to 931 mm yr1 and c accumulation rates from 28 to 108 g m2 yr1 the total peatland area and current peat c stock within the area of two studied satellite images were 21929 km2 and 3116 gt with a range of 08379461 gt the c stock is 32 with a range of 8798 of the best estimate of the south american tropical peatland c stock and 35 with a range of 09107 of the best estimate of the global tropical peatland c stock the whole pastazamaranon basin probably supports about twice this peatland area and peat c stock in addition to their contemporary geographical extent these peatlands probably also have a large historical vertical extension because of their location in a foreland basin characterized by extensive river sedimentation peat burial and subsidence for most of the quaternary period burial of peat layers in deposits of up to 1 km thick quaternary river sediments removes c from the shortterm c cycle between the biosphere and atmosphere generating a longterm c sink,466
Global reforestation and biodiversity conservation,the loss of forest is a leading cause of species extinction and reforestation is 1 of 2 established interventions for reversing this loss however the role of reforestation for biodiversity conservation remains debated and lacking is an assessment of the potential contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation globally we conducted a spatial analysis of overlap between 1550 forestobligate threatened species ranges and land that could be reforested after accounting for socioeconomic and ecological constraints reforestation on at least 43 369 million ha of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates this is approximately 15 of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur the greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics particularly brazil and indonesia although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation if implemented reforestation of 369 million ha would also contribute substantially to climatechange mitigation offering a way to achieve multiple sustainability commitments at once countries must now work to overcome key barriers eg unclear revenue streams high transaction costs to investment in reforestation 2020 society for conservation biology,467

Active restoration leads to rapid recovery of aboveground biomass but limited recovery of fish diversity in planted mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf,coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20 over the next decade mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives including carbon storage coastal resilience and fisheries recovery how planting seedlings the most common form of active restoration can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need we quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of guyanas national mangrove restoration program approximately a decade after seedling planting and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites aboveground biomass in restored sites 103 mg ha1 was 13 and 99 greater than intact 894 mg ha1 and degraded 012 mg ha1 sites respectively active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species with similar abundance between intact and restored sites in contrast fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region however even under a bestcase scenario for mangrove forest restoration fisheries did not recover during our studys timespan longterm monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests,469
"Environmental performance of agroforestry systems in the Cerrado biome, Brazil",agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems agroforestry systems afs have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time improve smallholders livelihoods in agricultural areas however studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements established by governmental initiatives are still uncommon in the literature therefore the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five biodiverse afs located in the cerrado biome to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers additionally the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in brazil was discussed relying on data from forestry inventory and indepth interviews with farmers the crop yield including fruit was estimated and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the global warming potential gwp accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the afs up until the date of analysis the results show the significant capacity of afs sequester carbon represented by the negative values of gwp ranging from 263 to 496 t co2 equivalents per hectare each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the afs establishment what influenced yields and gwp the high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the afs outputs allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products furthermore the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the afs5 future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods as well as environmental protection however efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge financial support and access to markets to thrive c 2019 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,470
"Linking above and belowground carbon sequestration, soil organic matter properties, and soil health in Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration",forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing co2 and storing c in terrestrial ecosystems however incomplete information on c storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystems holistic c dynamics this study provides an integrated assessment of c storage in above to belowground subsystems its consequences for greenhouse gas ghg fluxes and the quantity quality and origin of soil organic matter som in restored atlantic forests in brazil relations between som properties and soil health indicators were also explored we examined two restorations using tree planting active restoration an 8yearold forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds and a 15yearold forest with nativeplanted trees in one round without green manure restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites we measured c storage in soil layers 010 1020 and 2030 cm litter and plants ghg emissions were assessed using ch4 and co2 fluxes som quantity was evaluated using c and n quality using humification index hlifs and origin using delta13c and delta15n nine soil health indicators were interrelated with som attributes the primary forest presented the highest c stocks 1077 mg c ha1 followed by 15 and 8yearold restorations and pasture with 698 555 and 418 mg c ha1 respectively soil c stocks from restorations and pasture were 20 lower than primary forest however 8 and 15yearold restorations stored 123 and 283 mg ha1 more aboveground c than pasture the younger forest had delta13c and delta15n values of 21 and 17 ptsthousnd respectively lower than the 15yearold forest indicating more c derived from c3 plants and biological n fixation both restorations and pasture had at least 34 higher hlifs in deeper soil layers 1030 cm than primary forest indicating a lack of labile som native and 15yearold forests exhibited higher soil methane influx 1411 and 619 mug m2 h1 forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators with 69 of their variance explained by som properties however som quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies in conclusion active restoration of the atlantic forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for ghg mitigation nonetheless the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile c input into deeper soil layers 10 cm is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and longterm c storage,471

"The southern Brazilian grassland biome: soil carbon stocks, fluxes of greenhouse gases and some options for mitigation",the southern brazilian grassland biome contains highly diverse natural ecosystems that have been used for centuries for grazing livestock and that also provide other important environmental services here we outline the main factors controlling ecosystem processes review and discuss the available data on soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gases emissions from soils and suggest opportunities for mitigation of climatic change the research on carbon and greenhouse gases emissions in these ecosystems is recent and the results are still fragmented the available data indicate that the southern brazilian natural grassland ecosystems under adequate management contain important stocks of organic carbon in the soil and therefore their conservation is relevant for the mitigation of climate change furthermore these ecosystems show a great and rapid loss of soil organic carbon when converted to crops based on conventional tillage practices however in the already converted areas there is potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by using cropping systems based on no soil tillage and covercrops and the effect is mainly related to the potential of these crop systems to accumulate soil organic carbon in the soil at rates that surpass the increased soil nitrous oxide emissions further modelling with these results associated with geographic information systems could generate regional estimates of carbon balance,475
Coupled Ground- and Space-Based Assessment of Regional Inundation Dynamics to Assess Impact of Local and Upstream Changes on Evaporation in Tropical Wetlands,modifications of human land use and climate change are known to be a threat for the health and proper functioning of tropical wetlands they interfere with the seasonal flood pulse which is seen as the most important driver for biodiversity and directly controls evaporation in order to investigate the impact of local and upstream changes on wetlands a regional assessment of evaporation is crucial but challenging in such often remote and poorly gauged ecosystems evaporation is the major water balance component of these wetlands and links the flood pulse with the ecosystem it can therefore be seen as a proxy for their functioning in the last decades information from space became an important data source to assess remote wetland areas here we developed a new approach to quantify regional evaporation driven by inundation dynamics as its dominant control we used three water and vegetation indices mndwi modified normalized difference water index ndvi normalized difference vegetation index and evi enhanced vegetation index from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance products to assess regional inundation dynamics between the dry and wet seasons two years of continual in situ water level measurements at different locations in our study area the pantanal wetland of south america provided the reference to evaluate our method with processbased modeling that used the inundation dynamics to determine the water available for evaporation we were able to estimate actual evaporation aet on a regional scale relating aet to changes in discharge due to upstream flow modifications and on local precipitation over the last 13 years we found that the pantanal is more vulnerable to alternated inundation dynamics than to changes in local precipitation we concluded that coupling ground and spacebased information in this remote wetland area is a valuable first step to investigate the status of the pantanal ecosystem,476

"The Potential of Agroforestry in Supporting Food Security for Peatland Community - A Case Study in the Kalampangan Village, Central Kalimantan",food security is one of the main problems under the pandemic and climate change condition that we currently face managing peatland to fulfill community needs faces several problems including peat fire ghg emissions and loss of biodiversity agroforestry is one of land use systems on peatland that is capable of accommodating different interests while still concerning the conservation purposes this study aimed to assess the potential of agroforestry for ensuring the food security of local communities this research was carried out in the kalampangan village palangka raya city central kalimantan for six months this study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches including interviews and field observations interviews were carried out with 13 farmers in kalampangan who applied an agroforestry system the data gathered included all agroforestry components and number of the food production component the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics the results showed three agroforestry types were applied by the village community kalampangan namely agrosilviculture agrosilvopasture and agrofisheries the biodiversity of agroforestry in kalapangan is relatively high with a total of 58 different species identified a total of 86 of all agroforestry components are sources of food including fruits vegetables seeds tubers spices and livestock the information above shows that the peatland agroforestry in the kalampangan village has the potential to support food security while maintaining the biodiversity thus agroforestry can be recommended as a peatland land use and rehabilitation strategies to accommodate the basic needs of local communities and increasing their prosperity,483
"Permanence of avoided deforestation in a Transamazon REDD plus project (Para, Brazil)",rigorous impact evaluations of local redd reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests while wellbeing impacts have been mixed however will redd outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended using quasiexperimental methods we investigated the effects of one redd project in the brazilian amazon on deforestation and peoples wellbeing including intracommunity spillover effects leakage we then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended permanence this project combined payments for environmental services pes with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation data came from facetoface surveys with 113 households treatment 52 nonparticipant from treatment communities 35 control 46 in a threedatapoint panel design 2010 2014 and 2019 results indicate the redd project conserved an average of 78 to 103 of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees wellbeing by 2744 we found no evidence for significant intracommunity leakage after the project ended forest loss rebounded and perceived wellbeing declined yet importantly past saved forest was not cleared therefore our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activityreducing setaside forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated 2022 elsevier bv,484
Unfavorable successional pathways and the conservation value of logged tropical forest,conservation agencies are increasingly advocating that the survival of many tropical forest species may depend on disturbed forests and are directing scarce conservation resources to managing logged forests this requires critical evaluation in this 10year study we quantify tree community dynamics in three selectively logged areas harvested at different intensities and compare their recovery to two unlogged areas in kibale national park uganda over the 10 years 527 of the original 4840 tagged trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh died while the mortality rate was highest in the heavily logged area it was only significantly greater than one of the unlogged sites the density of new trees varied significantly among areas being highest in the lightly logged area but the density of new recruits in the heavily logged area did not differ from the unlogged areas overall the more heavily logged areas had higher growth rates than the unlogged or lightly logged areas however there was no difference among areas in the magnitude of the change in basal area and in both 1990 20 years postharvest and 2000 the basal area in the heavily logged area was significantly less than the unlogged areas in general findings from the heavily logged area suggest that the expectation that in logged areas a number of processes of forest regeneration will be accelerated relative to unlogged forest was not met thus 30 years after logging evidence suggests that forest recovery will be slower than expected we also present evidence to suggest that the climate in the region is changing which may account for changes in the population dynamics of certain species in the unlogged forests,485

Understanding landowners' intention to restore native areas: The role of ecosystem services,understanding landowners intention to voluntarily engage in conservation initiatives is essential to designing more realistic projects and interventions in this study we used the theory of planned behavior to identify the psychological constructs underlying landowners intention to restore areas with native vegetation on their properties over the next three years we extended the model investigating whether the perception of ecosystem services age number of springs and size of property affect the intention studied we interviewed 75 landowners whose properties are in the surroundings of a public protected area in brazil and applied structural equation modeling to analyze the acquired data the results agree with the predicted relationship between attitudes and intention furthermore perception of the ecosystem services and the number of springs on a given property are two factors which directly affect attitude and indirectly affect the intention to restore younger landowners are more willing to restore these results suggest that understanding the benefits of conserving biodiversity on farmland affects management practices investing in educational initiatives to promote more knowledge about ecosystem services will increase the involvement of more landowners in future conservation programs,487
Biomass Equations and Carbon Stock Estimates for the Southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest,tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales this is essential for effective carbon management which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation however reliable samplebased estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations which are lacking for the rainforests of the atlantic forest domain afd in this study we fitted biomass equations for the three main afd forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their aboveground biomass agb in rio de janeiro state brazil using nondestructive methods we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest semideciduous forest and restinga forest in the state the biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with treelevel data from 185 plots obtained in the national forest inventory conducted in rio de janeiro our locally developed allometric equations estimated the states biomass stocks at 708 54 mg ha1 and carbon stocks at 354 27 mg ha1 notably our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks these findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the atlantic forest especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations 2024 by the authors,488
Forest carbon stocks and fluxes in physiographic zones of India,background reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation redd is of central importance to combat climate change foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation which requires information on forest carbon storage here we estimated carbon storage in indias forest biomass for the years 2003 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation between two assessment periods ie assessment period first asp i 20032005 and assessment period second asp ii 20052007results the total estimated carbon stock in indias forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively there was a net flux of 372 mt of co 2 in asp i and 288 mt of co 2 in asp ii with an annual emission of 186 and 114 mt of co 2 respectively the carbon stock in indias forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards despite slight increase in forest cover the rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in asp ii has dropped by 3827 compared to asp iconclusion with the copenhagen accord india along with other basic countries china brazil and south africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions india will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its gdp by 2025 by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level activities like redd can provide a relatively costeffective way of offsetting emissions either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes managing forests or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation 2011 sheikh et al licensee biomed central ltd,489
Low predictability in aboveground biomass accumulation in Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites,there are high expectations about the role of active reforestation in mitigating climate change by means of carbon sequestration and storage fueling the carbon credit market carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or at best the expected size and wood density of planted trees however the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic multifactor restoration outcome we used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass agb accumulation in 30 brazilian semideciduous seasonal atlantic forest restoration sites sharing the same climate soil type and restoration technique we evaluated the entire age range of 119 years and three age intervals 13 years 48 years and over 9 years agb basal area and tree density increased considering all ages 119 years our results showed however that the agb tree density and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years adjusted model r2 values decreased with time suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural uncontrolled and to some extent unknown factors although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of longterm carbon stocks based on tree planting high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved 2023 society for ecological restoration,490
Globally significant changes in biological processes of the Amazon Basin: results of the Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment,the amazon river its huge basin and the changes in biological processes that are rapidly occurring in this region are unquestionably of global significance hence global change biology is delighted to host a special thematic issue devoted to the largescale biosphereatmosphere experiment in amaznia lba which is a multinational interdisciplinary research program led by brazil the goal of lba is no less modest than its subject to understand how amaznia functions as a regional entity in the earth system and how these functions are changing as a result of ongoing changes in land use this compilation of 26 papers resulting from lbarelated research covers a broad range of topics forest stocks of carbon c and nitrogen n fluxes of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds from vegetation soils and wetlands mapping and modeling landuse change fire risk and soil properties measuring changes caused by logging pasturing and cultivating and new research approaches in meteorology to estimate nocturnal fluxes of c from forests and pastures some important new synthesis can be derived from these and other studies the aboveground biomass of intact amazonian forests appears to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 while the wetlands and soils are a net source of atmospheric methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o respectively landuse change has so far had only a minor effect on basinwide emissions of ch4 and n2o but the net effect of deforestation and reforestation appears to be a significant net release of co2 to the atmosphere the sum of the 100year global warming potentials gwp of these annual sources and sinks of ch4 n2o and co2 indicate that the amazonian forestriver system currently may be nearly balanced in terms of the net gwp of these biogenic atmospheric gases of course large uncertainties remain for these estimates but the papers published here demonstrate tremendous progress and also large remaining hurdles in narrowing these uncertainties in our understanding of how amaznia functions as a regional entity in the earth system 2004 blackwell publishing ltd,491

Land use and land cover scenarios: An interdisciplinary approach integrating local conditions and the global shared socioeconomic pathways,land use and land cover lulc changes have profound impacts on the functioning of agroecosystems and have potential to mitigate global climate change however we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future lulc scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of lulc at a resolution of 30 30 m informed by historic relationships between lulc and their key drivers within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways we apply this methodology to a case study in the zona da mata brazil which has a history of major lulc changes the analysis of lulc changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 of total area while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 and coffee from 3 to 11 environmental protection legislation rural credit for smallholder farmers and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of lulc changes projected lulc for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious green road scenario or decrease in the high consumption rocky road scenario our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production but that major and contrasting changes in lulc can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future to guide this process lulc scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation 2020 elsevier ltd,495
Global and regional importance of the tropical peatland carbon pool,accurate inventory of tropical peatland is important in order to a determine the magnitude of the carbon pool b estimate the scale of transfers of peatderived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere resulting from land use change and c support carbon emissions reduction policies we review available information on tropical peatland area and thickness and calculate peat volume and carbon content in order to determine their best estimates and ranges of variation our best estimate of tropical peatland area is 441 025 km2 similar to 11 of global peatland area of which 247 778 km2 56 is in southeast asia we estimate the volume of tropical peat to be 1758 gm3 similar to 1825 of global peat volume with 1359 gm3 in southeast asia 77 of all tropical peat this new assessment reveals a larger tropical peatland carbon pool than previous estimates with a best estimate of 886 gt range 817919 gt equal to 1519 of the global peat carbon pool of this 685 gt 77 is in southeast asia equal to 1114 of global peat carbon a single country indonesia has the largest share of tropical peat carbon 574 gt 65 followed by malaysia 91 gt 10 these data are used to provide revised estimates for indonesian and malaysian forest soil carbon pools of 77 and 15 gt respectively and total forest carbon pools biomass plus soil of 97 and 19 gt peat carbon contributes 60 to the total forest soil carbon pool in malaysia and 74 in indonesia these results emphasize the prominent global and regional roles played by the tropical peat carbon pool and the importance of including this pool in national and regional assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and the prediction of peatderived greenhouse gas emissions,496
Mapping aboveground biomass in Indonesian lowland forests using GEDI and hierarchical models,spaceborne lidar light detection and ranging instruments such as the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broadscale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest including biomass and therefore must be related through statistical models further gedi observations are not spatially complete necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averagestotals such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas such as indonesia where the density of quality observations is diminished we developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gapfree maps of aboveground biomass density agbd at various resolutions within the lowlands of jambi province indonesia a biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from gedi waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning als data after selecting a locally suitable groundfinding algorithm setting we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and gediobserved waveforms finally a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the onorbit gedi observations these three models were nested into a single hierarchical model relating the spatial distribution of gedi observations to fieldmeasured agbd the model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship the model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass with a median relative standard deviation of 8 at the 1 km resolution and 26 at the 100 m resolution the spatially consistent information on agbd provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change this is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like jambi indonesia in order to understand the impacts of landuse transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber more generally we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions 2024 elsevier inc,497

Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia,nearly all published rates of secondary forest sf regrowth for amazonia are inferred from chronosequences we examined sf regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions we studied the emergence development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 sfs representing three age classes 15 610 and 1114 years old mean tree biomass accumulation in both the 15 and 610 years old 44 and 57 mg ha1 yr1 respectively abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly 57 and 41 from rates estimated from the chronosequence the older sfs with a mean growth rate of 99 mg ha1 yr1 followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59 of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period the 610yearold stands were rapidly selfthinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study mortality was high for all stands with 54 of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediateaged stands the forests were dominated by the tree vismia which represented 5566 of the biomass in all stands the vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time with other genera replacing the pioneer our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer timeperiods before abandonment certified emission reductions under the clean development mechanism of the kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management,501
Determination of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands,extensive peatlands in indonesia are a major store of carbon deforestation conversion to other land uses especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere if these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account indonesia is one of the largest emitters of co2 worldwide to improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in indonesian peatlands we applied 3d modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery landsat etm srtm and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements we demonstrate that srtm radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in central kalimantan south sumatra and west papua a strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store conservatively we estimate that at least 55 10 gt of carbon are stored in indonesias peatlands this amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands with this huge carbon storage and the current rate of degradation the tropical peatlands of indonesia have the power to negatively influence the global climate c 2008 elsevier bv all rights reserved,502

The protective role of mangroves in safeguarding coastal populations through hazard risk reduction: A case study in northeast Brazil,coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services safeguarding coastal communities and economies however sealevel rise can affect mangroves protective role by increasing exposure to coastal hazards and economic costs to better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sealevel rise we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosionaccretion rates on the shoreline we assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves finally we estimated the economic losses and costs from the longterm retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss this study was carried out along the western coast of the south atlantic in the northeast brazilian region coastal exposure indices were estimated using the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs invest software and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the digital shoreline analysis system dsas software finally the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building the results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030 in terms of the value of property loss this translates to us38800 and would increase to us72000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario based on our coastal vulnerability assessment almost 50 km of the coastline 20 would transition to intermediatehigh exposure levels if the current distribution of mangroves were to be lost it is expected to cost about us145 million in rockfill works and us21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sealevel rise on mangroves ecosystem services at the national level a total loss of mangroves in brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly us4000 million more robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystemservice cobenefits they provide the latter is essential in low and middleincome nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and wellbeing 2022 elsevier ltd,512
Short-term biochar effects on greenhouse gas emissions and phosphorus availability for maize,due to environmental issues many methods of exploiting renewable natural resources are alternatives to reduce the dependence on nonrenewable agricultural inputs phosphate fertilization on weathered tropical soil and waste reuse for example requires better management strategies thus biochar from organic residues can be a strategy to reduce pressure on natural resources in addition to having the potential to mitigate climate change this study aimed to evaluate the availability of p in tropical soils from the interaction of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf in the aboveground and root systems of the plant and its impact on greenhouse gas ghg emissions the results indicated that the addition of biochar was an alternative for c sequestration and ghg mitigation causing no damage to the plant the applied biochar amount had for the most part emission equal to or less than the control treatment soil only the sugarcane straw biochar bcs showed higher emissions mainly in the presence of p and amf biologically speaking there was no significant effect in the presence of mycorrhizae however with regard to plant production treatments where mycorrhizae were inoculated longer and wider leaves were found in the production of maize zea mays l plant material aboveground and root the upper and lower values were related to the poultry manure biochar bpm and the presence of p the values were lower indicating that for the good development of the plant only the presence of the biochar is sufficient without requiring the addition of phosphate fertilizer,513
Relationships between soil organic matter pools and nitrous oxide emissions of agroecosystems in the Brazilian Cerrado,in the brazilian cerrado despite the increasing adoption of notill systems there are still extended areas under conventional soil management systems that reduce soil carbon c and nitrogen n stocks and increase the emissions of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide n2o conservation agroecosystems such as notill have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate agricultureinduced climatic changes through reductions in n2o emissions however the relationship between organic matter and n2o emissions from soils under different agroecosystems is not yet clear this study hypothesized that agroecosystems under notill promote an accumulation of labile and stable som fractions along with a reduction of n2o emissions this study evaluated the effects of croprotation agroecosystems i on c and n pools and labile and stable som fractions ii on cumulative n2o emissions and iii on the relationships between som fractions and n2o emissions the agricultural systems consisted of i soybean followed by sorghum under notillage nt1 ii maize followed by pigeon pea under notillage nt2 iii soybean under conventional tillage followed by fallow soil ct iv and native cerrado cer after ct for 18 years following the replacement of cer the soil c stock in the 020 cm layer was reduced by 064 t ha1 year1 the notill systems were more efficient in accumulating labile and stable c fractions with values close to those observed under cer and were directly related to lower soil n2o emissions the cumulative pattern of n2o emissions was inverse to that of the following som fractions microbial biomass carbon permanganateoxidizable carbon particulate organic carbon inert carbon and humic substances based on principal component analysis the ct was generally separated from the other land use systems this separation was strongly influenced by the low c contents in the different som fractions and higher n2o emissions promoted by the ct c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved,514
Deep soil carbon loss offsets rapid aboveground carbon accumulation after reforestation,carbon c sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation however most studies including the international 4 per 1000 initiative focus on topsoil c only here we studied the response of deep soil c to different land restoration approaches samples were taken from rural sites in the atlantic forest biome brazil using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16to19yearold restoration approaches of former arable land reforestation natural regeneration and agroforestry sites adjacent arable land and a 25yearold secondary forest served as references we determined aboveground and belowground c pools including deep soil until 3 m depth we did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the c sequestration in the whole ecosystem however the c stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 15 mg ha1 significantly exceeding the respective aboveground c in natural regeneration 40 13 mg ha1 and agroforestry system 25 5 mg ha1 respectively this order however was reversed in soil where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon soc by 27 mg ha1 below 40 cm depth whereas soc stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 mg cha respectively compared to arable land we thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in c sequestration studies 2023 elsevier bv,515
Open digital mapping as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and assessing the carbon stock of tropical peatlands,tropical peatland holds a large amount of carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem indonesia responding to the global climate issues has legislation on the protection and management of the peat ecosystem however this effort is hampered by the lack of finescale accurate maps of peat distribution and its thickness this paper presents an open digital mapping methodology which utilises open data in an opensource computing environment as a costeffective method for mapping peat thickness and estimating carbon stock in indonesian peatlands the digital mapping methodology combines field observations with factors that are known to influence peat thickness distribution these factors are represented by multisource remotelysensed data derived from open and freely available raster data digital elevation models dem from srtm geographical information and radar images sentinel and alos palsar utilising machinelearning models from an opensource software we derived spatial prediction functions and mapped peat thickness and its uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content carbon stock for the area was estimated the uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules we demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of bengkalis island in riau province covering an area around 50000 ha results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat explaining up to 98 of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5 or an average error of 03 m the accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations we provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production ie 2 to 4 months with a cost between 03 and 05ha for an area of 50000 ha obviously there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy the advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed the methodology provides a blueprint for a nationalscale peat mapping 2017 elsevier bv,516
Effect of restoration methods on natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented levels nowadays in this context assessing restoration projects to recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the success of these initiatives this study evaluated the effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area diversity and composition of regenerating and planted species in a restoration area in the atlantic forest southeast brazil the experiment consisted of three treatments row planting row 2 2 m spacing nucleation nuc 13 individualsnucleus 5 5 m spacing and control with passive restoration pas the active restoration techniques had different planting densities at project implementation nuc 5200 seedlings ha1 row 2177 seedlings ha1 a floristic survey was carried out within 8 sampling units 15 15 m per treatment 10 years after implementation of the project including all planted and regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level 25 cm the abundance basal area and species richness of the planted and regenerated communities were estimated the active restoration techniques row and nuc resulted in higher values of basal area abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration pas a higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in row than in nuc additionally the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward higher diversity indices in row regarding the successional trajectory greater variation in species composition was observed in row after 10 years of planting the species composition was similar in row and nuc and differed from the composition in pas the species identified as indicator species in each treatment were annona glabra l in row trema micranthum l blume in nuc and vernonanthura polyanthes sprengel vega dematteis in pas our study revealed that active restoration techniques such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei were more effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration these results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in enhancing plant community diversity and structure in the brazilian atlantic forest sisef httpsiforestsiseforg,517
Could cattle ranching and soybean cultivation be sustainable? A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon,tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population consequently more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the amazon rainforest cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the amazon region we performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a metaanalysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services the results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the amazon biome in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a metaanalysis of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional landuses and those adopting sustainable practices the overall model indicated a nonsignificant effect although the results were heterogeneous crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected while livestock productivity soil organic carbon soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected also the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems our systematic review and metaanalysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation in turn our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices in conclusion we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the amazon,518
"Spatial identification of lost-and-found carbon hotspots at Javanese rice systems, Indonesia",context agricultural landscapes play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation the presence of trees outside forests has been recognized as a significant carbon pool but it is crucial to acknowledge that these trees serve purposes beyond being a carbon sink this study focuses on integrating border trees and home gardens as distinct land use classes in indonesian javanese agricultural land to assess their impact on carbon stock potential and biodiversity connectionsobjective the objective is to classify and quantify the tree composition of these classes estimate their carbon stock potential analyze plant species diversity and identify the ecological connections between home gardens and field bordersmethods to achieve this highresolution multispectral and synthetic aperture radar images were used from four sampling areas covering 100 km2 each in lamongan and malang districts east java indonesia for land coverland use mapping the land use function method was used to identify border trees and home gardens as separate land use classes carbon stock potential was estimated based on tree cover composition while plant species diversity was analyzed through field surveys and farmer focus group discussionsresults and conclusions crops with border trees cover approximately 28 to 48 of the cropland area in the study sites while home gardens represent about 74 to 85 of the settlement area this suggests a potential to double tree presence in these sites by adopting border trees and home gardens practices across the entire area the median tree cover ratio was around 27 for border trees and 33 for home gardens this stratification approach identified 31 to 50 more carbon stock compared to calculations using standard classes furthermore home gardens and border trees show a positive correlation with species richness indicating their role as keepers of biodiversity therefore home gardens and border trees could serve as a sustainability indicator for agricultural land in the javanese farm systemsignificance this research contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and climate change mitigation the stratification approach of identifying border trees and home gardens offers a costeffective approach for the better computation of carbon stock and can lead to effective land use policies and conservation measures that promote ecological resilience the study provides valuable insights for similar agricultural contexts worldwide guiding efforts toward a more sustainable agricultural future,519

Soil greenhouse gas emissions from inorganic fertilizers and recycled oil palm waste products from Indonesian oil palm plantations,a continuous rise in the global demand for palm oil has resulted in the largescale expansion of oil palm plantations and generated environmental controversy efforts to increase the sustainability of oil palm cultivation include the recycling of oil mill and pruning residues in the field but this may increase soil methane ch4 emissions this study reports the results of yearlong fieldbased measurements of soil nitrous oxide n2o and ch4 emissions from commercial plantations in north sumatra indonesia one experiment investigated the effects of soilwater saturation on n2o and ch4 emissions from inorganic fertilizers and organic amendments by simulating 25 mm rainfall per day for 21 days three additional experiments focused on emissions from a inorganic fertilizer urea b combination of enriched mulch with urea and c organic amendments empty fruit bunches enriched mulch and pruned oil palm fronds applied in different doses and spatial layouts placed in interrow zones piles patches or bands for a full year the higher dose of urea led to a significantly higher n2o emissions with the emission factors ranging from 24 to 27 in the longterm experiment which is considerably higher than the ipcc standard of 1 organic amendments were a significant source of both n2o and ch4 emissions but n2o emissions from organic amendments were 6686 lower than those from inorganic fertilizers organic amendments applied in piles emitted 63 and 71 more n2o and ch4 respectively than when spread out with twice the dose of organic amendments cumulative emissions were up to three times greater the simulated rainwater experiment showed that the increase in precipitation led to a significant increase in n2o emissions significantly suggesting that the time of fertilization is a critical management option for reducing emissions the results from this study could therefore help guide residue and nutrient management practices to reduce emissions while ensuring better nutrient recycling for sustainable oil palm production systems,525
Strong climate mitigation potential of rewetting oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands,for decades tropical peatlands in indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses mainly oil palm plantations which now cover onefourth of the degraded peatland area given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 of indonesias total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions in this study we measured co2 and ch4 fluxes soil temperature and water table level wtl for drained oil palm plantations rewetted oil palm plantations and secondary forests located in the mempawah and kubu raya regencies of west kalimantan indonesia we found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat co2 emissions though ch4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 and total respiration by 20 our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low co2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management however extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in west kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 39 mtco2 yr1 this result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets 2024 the authors,526
The effect of contrasting soil textures on the efficiency of alternate wetting-drying to reduce water use and global warming potential,alternate wettingdrying awd is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas ghg emissions from rice fields the research aimed at comparing awd on contrast soil textures field experiments were conducted at two sites representing coarsetexture soil silt loam and finertexture soil silty clay to study the efficiency of awd on water use methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emission grain yield global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi the experiments were conducted during the 2020 dry season in central java province indonesia evaluating continuous flooding cf and awd as the main plot and biocharcompost bc mixture at a rate of 0 5 and 10 t ha1as the subplot the results unveiled that awd on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12 and 18 respectively the implementation of awd on silt loam soil significantly p 005 reduced the total gwp by 396 without yield loss and ghgi by 384 compared to cf conversely on silty clay soil the gwp and ghgi reduction was marginal only about 4 biocharcompost addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures we found that the implementation of awd on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and gwp expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of ghg mitigation action and saving irrigation water 2022 elsevier bv,527
Microclimate and thermal comfort indices in silvopastoral systems under different planting directions and seasons,the orientation of treerows in a silvopastoral system associated with different seasons of the year allows more or less sunlight penetration resulting in deliberate modification of the microclimate composition and thermal conditions provided to animals in this sense the aims of this study were to evaluate microclimatic variables and thermal comfort indices for eastwest and northsouth oriented silvopastoral systems compared to unshaded systems during summer and winter the study was conducted at the modelo ii farm 21 degrees 08 s 53 degrees 17 w at an altitude of 354 m a randomized block design in scheme of splitsplit plots with five repetitions was adopted two planting directions and a control treatment unshaded were evaluated in the plots collection times were evaluated in subplots and the distance from eucalyptus trees was evaluated in subsubplots changes in the eastwest and northsouth planting directions did not promote changes in climate variables nor did they change the thermal comfort indices during summer there were differences however in temperature and relative humidity of the air black globe temperature and radiant heat load during winter silvopastoral systems provide improvements in the environment and concomitantly to the thermal comfort of animals when compared to unshaded systems however thermal stress situations occur despite the presence of trees depending on the time of the day and the distance from the rows of eucalyptus trees,528
"Impacts of Land Use Changes on Soil Functions and Water Security: Insights from a Three-Year-Long Study in the Cantareira System, Southeast of Brazil",maintaining soil functions is crucial for human wellbeing but there is a lack of integration between soil water security ecosystem services and climate change to bridge this knowledge gap and address erosioninduced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure a threeyearlong study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types typic hapludult typic dystrudept and typic usthortent combined with different land uses native forest eucalyptus plantation rotational grazing and extensive grazing in a critical water supply region for the so paulo metropolitan area in southeastern brazil surface runoff evaluated for erosion resistance was measured using the cornell infiltrometer and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 15 m for groundwater recharge analysis soil hydraulic properties were also measured the results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity particularly in the surface layer compared to eucalyptus and pastures native forests in typic hapludult showed a higher runoff rate 200 to 250 mm h1 due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential therefore reducing the amount of water stored typic usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration resulting in perched water in the surface layer in typic dystrudept the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity 05 cm 1159 cm h1 than eucalyptus 05 cm 364 cm h1 rotational grazing 05 cm 194 cm h1 and extensive grazing 05 cm 26 cm h1 but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses this work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge reducing the soil surface erosion mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer maintaining recharge potential for ultisols pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management with these results a contribution is made to soil and water conservation providing support for sustainable management practices in erosionprone areas 2023 by the authors,529
Spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed tropical forest in Southern Brazil,floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants however these analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity leading to develop additional tools this study aimed to estimate the spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in a brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area we used indices to measure the tree species diversity dbh 10 cm in 400 sampling units 25 m x 25 m from a continuous forest inventory semivariograms were fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied to compose maps mean diversity values were constant in the continuous inventories indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of ecological succession on the other hand tree diversity presented spatial patterns identified by geostatistics in which the dynamics were composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species with different ecological features and densities gap dynamics advancement of forest succession mortality and araucaria angustilofias cohorts,530
Tropical Peat Accumulation in Central Amazonia,amazonia has been recently included in discussions on the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle owing to extensive peatlands up to 75 m thick reported from western amazonia peru the aim of this study was to explore peat accumulation in central amazonia brazil of seven field sites six located in the negro river basin and one close to the junction of the negro river with the amazon four had a peat deposit from 010 to 210 m thick another two sites had other organic soil type which could not be called peat only one site did not have any organic deposit the lossonignition loi carbon content and dry bulk density measured for the four peatland sites varied from 177 to 974 11 to 59 and 00002 to 0572 g cm3 respectively all sites were classified as minerotrophic based on ph and peat thickness the study confirms that amazonian peatlands are not limited to western amazonia but also exist in central amazonia we could not find as thick and extensive peats as in western amazonia which we suggest is due to differences in rainfall and hydrology tectonic conditions topography subsoil type and frequency of fires,531

Forest recovery prognostics in conservation units of the Atlantic rainforest,forest growth models can provide valuable support tools for forest recovery assessment and forestry management whether in the form of diagnostic or prognostic furthremore they can be applied to characterize each phytophysiognomy in terms of vegetation growth parameters that and can be applied to gauge the spatiotemporal progress of recovery processes up to date such parameters remain mostly unknown in this paper we explore a modelling framework aimed at providing computeraided prognostics of forest recovery based on the diffusivelogistic growth dlg model and present case studies for a number of four preservation areas located in the brazilian atlantic rainforest biome the modelling framework involves the application of vegetation indices derived from satellite images and a computational implementation of the dlg model the objective of the study is to illustrate how forest restoration and recovery projects could gain from the proposed methodology due to the fact that the likely outcomes of management practices could be assessed in advance additionally it aims to determine the characteristic parameters of forest growth for a portion of the atlantic rainforest biome the diffusion and growth rate parameters from the dlg model were calibrated and they show the evolution of forest density over the years the results show that the forest recovery process can take several decades to stabilize in the absence of negative interventions in the forest growth the model and the implementation presented in this work are freely available and they can be an important tool for decision and policy making in what concerns forest recovery,537
Distinguishing forest types in restored tropical landscapes with UAV-borne LIDAR,forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change conserve biodiversity and ensure future sustainability of forests with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions to hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short because they are laborintensive and costly meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches conservation versus production focus unoccupied aerial vehicles uav with light detection and ranging lidar sensors can observe forests vertical and horizontal structural variation which has the potential to distinguish forest types in this study we explored this potential of uavborne lidar to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern brazil by using a supervised classification method the study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups conservation remnant forests natural regrowth and active restoration plantings and production monoculture mixed and abandoned plantations forests uavborne lidar data was used to extract several canopy height model chm voxel and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests 90 accuracy classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate 62 and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types understory leaf area index lai and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics in particular lai understory showed the most variation and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration the difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management regeneration dynamics and structure in a restoration context we showed the ability of uavborne lidar to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy future research may explore a fusion of uavborne lidar with optical sensors and include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize and distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration 2023 the authors,538
"Decadal Fire Effects on the Structure, Composition, Diversity, and Aboveground Carbon Stocks of a Neotropical Savanna",fire is a common disturbance in the brazilian savanna the cerrado wherein highfrequency fires drive the vegetation structure composition function and dynamics of savanna ecosystems under climate change pressure further understanding of firevegetation relationships and interactions can provide new approaches for establishing integrated fire management strategies and can promote postfire savanna vegetation recovery to understand how 15 years of annually manipulated burning has affected vertical and horizontal structures of the vegetation species composition and diversity metrics species richness shannons diversity and pielous evenness and aboveground carbon stocks we surveyed all woody plant species with a diameter greater than three centimeters in 15 plots of a typical brazilian savanna cerrado stricto sensu at an experimental research station in central brazil the cerrado biome the 15 plots five plots per treatment had been differently affected by fire events over a decade and comprised three treatments i annual fire ii legacy fire 15 years since the last fire event and iii control not burned in the past 30 years a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis indicated that fire had a significant effect on the species composition among the treatments some species benefited from fire such as erythroxylum suberosum whereas other species propagated better without fire such as roupala montana and dalbergia miscolobium over a decade of annual fire events have led to decreases in shannons diversity species richness and stem density which were significantly lower in the annual fire treatment than in the control and legacy fire treatments stem density by diameter and height size classes except for the 12 m class and above 8 m class was higher in the control than that in the annual fire treatment but the number of dead trees did not differ between the control and the annual fire treatment our results also showed that fire was a factor in changes in the evaluated parameters such as in the annual fire treatment where fire reduced the amount of biomass and therefore the carbon stocks this study suggests that if burned yearly typical brazilian savannas can become less biodiverse in terms of woody plant species which negatively affects their fire resilience therefore fire management practices should focus on determining the frequency of fire disturbances from which these ecosystems may benefit the most 2023 by the authors,539

No evidence of local deforestation leakage from protected areas establishment in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forest,establishing protected areas pas could displace or cause leakage of deforestation into adjacent areas such leakage would potentially offset pas conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd here we investigate forest loss inside pas borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new pas n 425 within the amazon and the atlantic forests in brazil between 2004 and 2017 we applied a before aftercontrolintervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from pas establishment using a spatial inside and outside pas temporal before and after pa establishment measure of deforestation rates we also used random forest to investigate the drivers of the effect of pas establishment on their surrounding areas we found that when pas establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation blockage similarly when pas establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation such a pattern was most common for indigenous territories especially in the deforestation arch in the amazon however we did not find significant evidence for leakage as pas surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with pas unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries therefore leakage should not limit the establishment of new pas instead greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing pas with high priority given to indigenous territories,546
Land Use Impact on Microbial and Biochemical Indicators in Agroecosystems of the Brazilian Cerrado,microbial and biochemical properties are of great importance in soil quality evaluation in brazil and especially in the cerrado brazilian savanna benchmarking studies are needed to assess the impacts of land use on microbial and biochemical indicators this study aimed to compare the impacts of land use on the microbial chemical and biochemical properties of the soil under cerrado ce 32yrold pine forest po and 11yrold notill nt soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 10 cm in january june and december of 2008 and were evaluated based on chemical properties basal respiration soil organic carbon soc microbial biomass carbon mbc and enzymes betaglucosidase dehydrogenase and acid neutral and alkaline phosphatases comparative analysis of respiratory activity and mbc showed that the nt system had a positive effect and pf a negative one relative to the reference ce nt soil management practices improve quality mainly by benefiting chemical characteristics c and n increasing mbc and increasing microbial activity relative to ce and pf soil enzymatic activity dehydrogenase betaglucosidase and phosphatase was lower in pf and higher in nt than in ce principal component analysis showed that indicator variability regarding soil sampling period was higher in nt than in either pf or ce in conclusion we recommend 3glucosidase and mbc as indicators of the impacts of land use practices,547
Protected areas within multifunctional landscapes: Squeezing out intermediate land use intensities in the tropics?,a protected area pa tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats typically a pa is at the start of a forest transition gradient the establishment of a pa influences the whole gradient we analyzed the temporal patterns of landuse change inside and outside four pas with one located in each of laos indonesia madagascar and cameroon in laos in the viengkham landscape the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the pa and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted in the three other landscapes the policies associated with the implementation of pas increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the pas in indonesia in the bungo landscape forms of landuse associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees landuse became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened we tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species two important findings were i a leakage zone of influence of at least 10 km around a pa needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the pa and ii agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation while providing a source of livelihood for the local people c 2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,548
Comparison of carbon dioxide efflux in different land use typologies,management systems are crucial for soils functioning as a drain or source of greenhouse gas emissions in this sense among the alternatives for reducing the precursors of the greenhouse effect are integrated agricultural production systems particularly agroforestry systems these integrated systems maximize the use of biological cycles soil and animal waste reducing agrochemicals and improving the condition of the rural populations involved the present study aimed to evaluate the co2 efflux in different land use types the study was conducted in four agroecosystems forest fo agroforestry systems afs mandala md and degraded area da to quantify the co2 emanating from the soil 10 ml of 05 n koh aqueous solution is used and titrated using 01 n hcl phenolphthalein and 1 methyl orange as an indicator the co2 concentration from 500 am to 500 pm was lower the lowest co2 production occurred in fo 827 co2 mg m2 h1 statistically differing from the other areas that obtained a co2 rate higher than 140 mg m2 h1 as for kinetics it was observed in all areas that the greatest release of co2 during the day occurred at 700 am and this release decreased as the soil temperature increased the greatest release of co2 and the highest temperatures occurred in da showing that these systems with anthropic modifications can be considered co2 emitters however systems closer to the natural ecosystem such as the afs will store carbon in the soil functioning as a carbon store therefore to reduce co2 emissions from agricultural activities it is necessary to use systems that imitate natural ecosystems,549

"Structure, survival, and species diversity in a tropical dry forest submitted to coppicing",the caatinga is a tropical dry forest rational exploitation of caatinga wood resources consists of sustainable forest management under coppice systems therefore the recovery of the timber stock for the next cycle will depend on the regrowth and survival capacity of the exploited species as well as on the future structure of the forest the objective of this work was to characterize the survival structure and diversity of caatinga submitted to coppicing under sustainable forest management comparing preand postharvest conditions permanent plots were installed in a caatinga in the municipality of florestape brazil in 2013 and measured 2 years after clearcutting height and circumference at the base cab of the stumps and shoots were obtained for two situations precut grouping by live and dead stumps and ii postcut shoots on only live stumps in addition all individual shrubtree species cab 4 cm not included in the postcut situation were identified measured cab and height total and tagged as persisting 6 cm cab or growing 6 cab 4 cm in 2015 the survival and mortality of the stumps were quantified as well as changes in the horizontal structure and floristic diversity there was a decrease in the number of species 2 years after cutting mainly due to the loss of croton rhamnifolius h b k and sapium glandulatum vell pax and predominance of cenostigma bracteosum tul e gagnon g p lewis aspidosperma pyrifolium mart and cnidoscolus quercifolius pohl resulting in a greater number of individuals of a few species the outstanding regrowth capacity of these three species indicates that the forest remnant under study may eventually consist of populations with a predominance of species capable of coppicing,554
Effect of conversion from sugarcane preharvest burning to residues green trashing on SOC stocks and soil fertility status: Results from different soil conditions in Brazil,land use and land management have a recognized impact on the cycle of elements such as carbon and nitrogen and are thus expected to play an important role in the mitigation against humaninduced environmental changes such as global warming brazil is the worlds largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning b to mechanized greentrashing gt whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain this study performed in the saopaulo state southeast brazil investigated the impact of shifting from b to gt on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks and chemical elements at three 4year and one 12year old trial sites soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types clayey to sandyclay hapludox hapudult and sandy quartzpsamment sampling was up to 04 m 0005 00501 0102 0204 m depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots of 02 ha size each per treatment arranged in randomized block design the samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture bulk density aggregate stability ph and chemical concentrations overall conversion from b to gt increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 128130 mg ha1 y1 and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 04 m soil layer by 106 mg c ha1 y1 and 011 mg n ha1 y1 respectively the highest carbon sequestration rate 108o y1 occurred in the most carbon depleted soils which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium magnesium and potassium all the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration especially within the topmost soil layer because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together considering the average sequestration rate of 106 ton ha1 y1 the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for brazil where 88 million hectares are under greentrashing of sugarcane residues would be 93 million ton c y1 however intermittent tillage every 45 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage there is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to fmd sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses,555
Conversion of a tropical forest into agroforest alters the fine root-related carbon flux to the soil,large areas of remaining tropical forests are affected by anthropogenic disturbances of various intensities these disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget we analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in southeast asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity fine root production fine root turnover and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance with a reduction of more than 45 between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest the amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity however rootrelated c flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees in contrast the relative importance of c transfer from root death in the total above and belowground c input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the c input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest we conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in southeast asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil c 2008 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,556
Structure and composition of altered riparian forests in an agricultural Amazonian landscape,deforestation and fragmentation influence the microclimate vegetation structure and composition of remaining patches of tropical forest in the southern amazon at the frontier of cropland expansion forests are converted and fragmented in a pattern that leaves standing riparian forests whose dimensions are mandated by the brazilian national forest code these altered riparian forests share many characteristics of wellstudied upland forest fragments but differ because they remain connected to larger areas of forest downstream and because they may experience wetter soil conditions because reduction of forest cover in the surrounding watershed raises groundwater levels and increases stream runoff we compared forest regeneration structure composition and diversity in four areas of intact riparian forest and four areas each of narrow medium and wide altered riparian forests that have been surrounded by agriculture since the early 1980s we found that seedling abundance was reduced by as much as 64 and sapling abundance was reduced by as much as 67 in altered compared to intact riparian forests the most pronounced differences between altered and intact forest occurred near forest edges and within the narrowest sections of altered riparian forests woody plant species composition differed and diversity was reduced in altered forests compared to intact riparian forests however despite being fragmented for several decades large woody plant biomass and carbon storage the number of live or dead large woody plants mortality rates and the size distribution of woody plants did not differ significantly between altered and intact riparian forests thus even in these relatively narrow forests with high edge area ratios we saw no evidence of the increases in mortality and declines in biomass that have been found in other tropical forest fragment studies however because of the changes in both species community and reduced regeneration it is unclear how long this relative lack of change will be sustained additionally brazil recently passed a law in their national forest code allowing narrower riparian buffers than those studied here in restored areas which could affect their longterm sustainability,557
Post-fire plant regeneration across a closed forest-savanna vegetation transition,fire is a major environmental factor influencing vegetation heterogeneity with closed forest and savanna ecosystems having different management needs due to their different responses to fire disturbance however the differences in postfire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters additionally postfire dynamics of forestsavanna ecotones is poorly characterized with the hypothesis that closed forest savannas and ecotones will exhibit different postfire responses we studied the vegetation diversity structure and dynamics in an upland forest savanna vegetation mosaic in minas gerais brazil following a fire that occurred in september 2011 in january 2012 we identified tagged and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within fortysix 4 m2 plots in closed forest savanna and ecotone vegetation and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014 we modelled the relationship between shortterm dynamics parameters recruitment mortality basal area loss and gain and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas and vegetation type species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna across all vegetation types stem density decreased and basal area increased parameters such as recruitment net changes in the number of individuals and the gain loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types however stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna overall our results support that within a climaticallysimilar vegetation mosaic closed forests exhibit different postfire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected ecotones exhibited postfire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas understanding the longerterm vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management strategies for forestsavanna mosaics c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved,558
Microclimate and soil and water loss in shaded and unshaded agroforestry coffee systems,the agroforestry systems are a potential pathway to improve soil quality and protect against extreme temperatures that negatively impact coffee growth however more studies about the effects of inclusion of tree elements in coffee systems soil and water loss dynamics are needed this study aimed to understand how the inclusion of trees influences the microclimate and soil and water loss in shaded compared with unshaded coffee systems two pluviometers one in shaded and the other in unshaded area were installed to record hourly data from august 2009 to june 2010 soil temperature and moisture were monitored by a system of sensors air temperature soil temperature at 10 cm depth and soil moisture at 10 30 and 100 cm depths recording data at hourly intervals from august 2009 to june 2010 the surface water runoff and soil mass lost by laminar erosion were measured using collectors air temperature under shaded conditions had less variation than under unshaded conditions and lower maximum temperatures soil and water loss of both systems were small due to the high soil cover our results indicate that the water loss was higher in the unshaded area 338 l ha1 during the study period compared with the shaded system 150 l ha1 soil temperature was lower under shaded conditions and there was water absorption complementarity between coffee and trees in shaded area soil moisture of shaded area was lower than unshaded area for all depths in all monitored period therefore the shaded agroforestry coffee systems improve microclimate conditions and deep water drainage compared with unshaded coffee systems,559
"Empirical models to predict LAI and aboveground biomass of Coffea arabica under full sun and shaded plantation: a case study of South of Minas Gerais, Brazil",leaf area index lai and above ground biomass agb are two parameters that are difficult to measure but very useful in this paper we investigated the relationship between coffee biophysical properties and lai and agb in two coffee production systems full sun fs and shaded with macadamia nuts sh the paper proposes an empirical relationship for calculating coffee agb and coffee lai which avoids destructive methods using simple field measurements and agrometeorological data here we reported that lai is related to canopy structure but subject to strong seasonal variations which can be identified using water requirements satisfaction index wrsi coffee lai answers to the decreased wrsi with 1 month lag wrsi1 and lai values decreases more for fs systems than for sh systems during dry periods the best empirical model to predict lai for fs coffee production system was based on canopy height ch and wrsi1 value for sh systems the best model used ch wrsi1 and the height of the first pair of branches coffee agb values were measured using destructive analyses and an empirical equation was developed both coffee production systems stocked carbon whereas the sh system stocked an increased carbon amount provided by the macadamia trees that contributed with 15 of the total carbon above ground both systems can be considered mitigation techniques since they are able to remove atmospheric carbon and stock it in the biomass which has been largely proposed as a compensation mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions,560
Original Assessment of soil salinity status under different land-use conditions in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil,soil salinization and sodification caused by inadequate land management is one of the main threats to the semiarid agroecosystems it is essential to investigate saline levels under different landuse conditions to maintain the sustainability of agricultural production the main objective of this study was to diagnose the salinity status of the soil in different landuse conditions in the semiarid region of northeast brazil soil samples were collected in the surface layer 05 cm of three different landuse conditions areas of low salinity native vegetation caatinga areas of different saline levels cultivated areas and areas of very high salinity desertified by salinity and compared regarding the chemical attributes of the soils by descriptive and multivariate analysis the results showed that sodium and chloride were the predominant soluble ions in cultivated and desertified areas due to saline waters commonly used in the study region increases in electrical conductivity values of 1219 and 23207 were observed for cultivated and desertified areas respectively compared to areas of native vegetation the principal component analysis contributed to identifying parameters responsible for the variation in soil salinity and the second factor identified that percentage of exchangeable sodium electrical conductivity and exchangeable and soluble sodium plays an essential role in soil desertification however calcium magnesium sodium and chloride ions correlated positively with variables that degrade soils ec esp and sar we also found that in desertified areas in addition to chloride sulfate is also present in expressive levels and due to the strong associations with calcium magnesium and sodium our study suggests that in addition to the free forms of these ions the forms of chlorides and sulfates of calcium magnesium and sodium also effectively contribute to the degradation of the areas the combination of multivariate analysis geochemistry laboratory techniques was a valuable tool to identify and monitor saline levels in converting uncultivated to cultivated areas and from cultivated areas to desertified areas 2022,561
Abundance and richness of invertebrates in shade-grown versus sun-exposed coffee home gardens in Indonesia,complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations coffee coffea spp is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sunexposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system we aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in west java indonesia by comparing 14 sunexposed and 14 shadegrown gardens we collected data in marchapril 2019 via pitfall traps pan traps and beating tray in each field we ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sunexposed vs shadegrown coffee gardens and tested associations between main taxa overall there was no difference in the richness sunexposed 1986 se119 shadegrown 1971 se119 zvalue 012 p value 0904 and abundance sunexposed 14193 se 318 shadegrown 13993 se316 zvalue 035 p value 0706 of invertebrates in coffee gardens although taxa specific differences were present sunexposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests blattodea rhinotermitidae ectobiidae coleoptera scarabaeidae lycidae and tenebrionidae diptera anisolabididae drosophilidae and sarcophagidae camponotus spp were the most dominant ants in shadegrown gardens while dolichoderus spp and myrmicaria spp were more abundant in sunexposed gardens despite the fact that sunexposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shadegrown coffee fields the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sunexposed and shadegrown coffee suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services it is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity,562
Shade trees and agrochemical use affect butterfly assemblages in coffee home gardens,agroforestry systems have been recognised as a possible refuge for biodiversity especially when bordering intact landscapes the intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity the relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity however is not clearcut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences we assessed the influence of different shade cover shade tree richness richness of other crops distance from the forest and use of chemicals on the diversity richness and abundance of butterflies a bioindicator in coffee home gardens we collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in west java indonesia via pollard transects totalling 151 km julyaugust 2019 and julyaugust 2020 we found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens via generalised additive mixed models we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance p 0001 and richness p 0039 of butterflies while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance p 0001 diversity p 0046 and richness p 0001 of butterflies the other predictors did not have a significant effect the high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient but the relationship between butterfly abundance diversity and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity the negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators coffee production in indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity this process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately,563
Beneficial Effect of Biochar on Irrigated Dwarf-Green Coconut Tree,the coconut tree is considered one of the greatest consumers of irrigation water ranging from 100 to 240 l day1 the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of biochar application on decreased irrigation water needs in a 2year irrigated dwarf coconut palm orchard field experiment biochar was characterized chemically and by electron microscope images biochar morphology presented several micropores indicating water retention potential amounts of biochar were tested 0 5 10 20 40 g of biochar per kg of soil representing 00 05 10 20 and 40 kg per plant micro sprinkler irrigation started following the planting of the 90day old hybrid dwarf coconut seedlings the impacts of the application of the biochar on the chemical attributes of the soil biometry of the coconut plants water storage in the 003 m soil layer and the volume of irrigation water required by treatment were evaluated after two years 2017 and 2018 the application of the biochar resulted in no statistically significant differences in the chemical attributes of the soil and biometric variables of plants between different treatments the volume of annual irrigation water per plant versus biochar quantity demonstrated a decreasing effect due to the increase of soil water storage the dose of 40 g of biochar per kg of soil presented the highest twoyear average soil water retention 003 m layer among treatments 34 36 34 38 and 45 mm respectively resulting in lower 2year irrigation water demand 28 36 29 28 and 20 l plant1 day1 respectively,564
Ecosystem carbon storage and partitioning in a tropical seasonal forest in Southwestern China,tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle despite an increasing number of studies have addressed carbon storage in tropical forests the regional variation in such storage remains poorly understood uncertainty about how much carbon is stored in tropical forests is an important limitation for regionalscale estimates of carbon fluxes and improving these estimates requires extensive field studies of both above and belowground stocks in order to assess the carbon pools of a tropical seasonal forest in asia total ecosystem carbon storage was investigated in xishuangbanna sw china averaged across three 1 ha plots the total carbon stock of the forest ecosystem was 303 t c ha1 living tree carbon stocks both above and belowground ranged from 163 to 258 t c ha1 the aboveground biomass c pool is comparable to the dipterocarp forests in sumatra but lower than those in malaysia the variation of c storage in the tree layer among different plots was mainly due to different densities of large trees dbh 70 cm the contributions of the shrub layer herb layer woody lianas and fine litter each accounted for 12 t c ha1 to the total carbon stock the mineral soil c pools top 100 cm ranged from 84 to 102 t c ha1 and the c in woody debris from 56 to 125 t c ha1 representing the second and third largest c component in this ecosystem our results reveal that a high percentage 70 of c is stored in biomass and less in soil in this tropical seasonal forest this study provides an accurate estimate of the carbon pool and the partitioning of c among major components in tropical seasonal rain forest of northern tropical asia results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional c cycles and have great implications for conservation planning c 2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved,565
Shading effect on physiological parameters and in vitro embryo production of tropical adapted Nellore heifers in integrated crop-livestock-forest systems,the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of increased shadow supply in integrated croplivestockforest systems on in vitro embryonic development and physiological parameters related to stress response in nellore heifers bos indicus for the study animals n 16 were randomly divided into two groups and kept in areas with different afforestation systems the integrated croplivestockforest iclf and the integrated croplivestock icl system the microclimate of the iclf system provided better comfort conditions than icl no differences of respiratory rate rectal temperature cortisol t3 t4 oocyte quality and cleavage rate between the systems were verified a higher blastocyst rate was observed in the iclf p 005 the results demonstrate that nellore heifers managed in iclf during summer in midwest of brazil showed higher production of in vitro embryos without typical changes in its physiological parameters the results observed in the present study indicate that zebu females are able to respond satisfactorily to the intense heat conditions however we believe that the long period to which these animals are exposed to these conditions interferes in the oocyte competence and embryo development 2020 the authors,566
A multicriteria evaluation approach to set forest restoration priorities based on water ecosystem services,forest plays an important role in keeping water ecosystem services such as drinking water provision thus payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds however funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement in this context our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes for this we have developed a decisionmaking support model for agricultural watersheds in the atlantic forest region based on mixed approaches that were multicriteria evaluation mce and participatory technique the model will help decisionmakers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation so we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns the base of the model was the following criteria that were produced with highresolution data and ranking in the participatory technique context considering their importance for the study proximity to spring slope soil erodibility topographic index and landuselandcover lulc the criteria were aggregated by the weighted linear combination wlc method an mce method the priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers at most 200 m far from rivers on the greatest slopes 40 on soils associated with high potential of erosion and predominantly in agriculture lands however this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed native forest covers 55 of its area than in the watershed nonforested native forest covers 25 another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class which is a characteristic of the wlc method thus areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds we can conclude that for small watersheds the mce method with highresolution data supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services this way our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide,567

Impact of forest plantation on methane emissions from tropical peatland,tropical peatlands are a known source of methane ch4 to the atmosphere but their contribution to atmospheric ch4 is poorly constrained since the 1980s extensive areas of the peatlands in southeast asia have experienced landcover change to smallholder agriculture and forest plantations this landcover change generally involves lowering of groundwater level gwl as well as modification of vegetation type both of which potentially influence ch4 emissions we measured ch4 exchanges at the landscape scale using eddy covariance towers over two landcover types in tropical peatland in sumatra indonesia a a natural forest and b an acacia crassicarpa plantation annual ch4 exchanges over the natural forest 91 09 g ch4 m2 year1 were around twice as high as those of the acacia plantation 47 15 g ch4 m2 year1 results highlight that tropical peatlands are significant ch4 sources and probably have a greater impact on global atmospheric ch4 concentrations than previously thought observations showed a clear diurnal variation in ch4 exchange over the natural forest where the gwl was higher than 40 cm below the ground surface the diurnal variation in ch4 exchanges was strongly correlated with associated changes in the canopy conductance to water vapor photosynthetic photon flux density vapor pressure deficit and air temperature the absence of a comparable diurnal pattern in ch4 exchange over the acacia plantation may be the result of the gwl being consistently below the root zone our results which are among the first eddy covariance ch4 exchange data reported for any tropical peatland should help to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of ch4 emissions from a globally important ecosystem provide a more complete estimate of the impact of landcover change on tropical peat and develop sciencebased peatland management practices that help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions,569
"The Use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to Analyze the Influence of Vegetation Cover Changes on the Streamflow in the Manhuacu River Basin, Brazil",the intensification of anthropogenic activities in river basins has significantly altered river streamflow thus the aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of temporal and spatial changes in vegetation cover on the streamflow of the manhuacu river brazil using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ndvi values were obtained from landsat images for 1986 to 2014 and processed on the google earth engine gee to characterize the hydrologic behavior of the basin we used data from eight streamflow gauge stations and 18 rain gauge stations and we conducted mannkendall and pettitt tests to evaluate the stationarity hypothesis to verify the relationship between the vegetation cover changes and the streamflow we used multiple regression models in the analyzed period we observed a slight increase in the vegetation cover and a reduction in pasture areas in most cases the annual low flow exhibited a decreasing tendency because of an increase in vegetation area we obtained satisfactory adjustments of the multiple regression models by examining the correlations among the change in vegetation cover rainfall and evapotranspiration data which resulted in adjusted ra2 values ranging from 059 to 096 the ndvi values were a good indicator of vegetation cover dynamics in the manhuacu river basin which influenced the nonstationary streamflow behavior,570

Combining mechanical control and tree planting to restore montane Atlantic forests dominated by the Neotropical bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum),climate and landuse changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services however controlling these superdominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species native clonal ferns from the pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown here we assessed to what extent removing the aboveground biomass of the shadeintolerant pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane atlantic forests in southeast brazil in four sites dominated by p arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots 1 control without interference 2 cutting twice per year 3 cutting twice per year plus tree planting 4 cutting three times per year and 5 cutting three times per year plus tree planting over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored p arachnoideum height rhizome and aboveground biomass as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank we also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 after two years the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in aboveground biomass 1 to 01 kgm2 and abundance 80 to 15 of p arachnoideum planted trees exhibited low survival 47 rates and growth 30 cmyear and hence had no effect on the dominance of p arachnoideum treatments did not affect rhizome biomass suggesting that p arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration trees were rare in both the established vegetation less than 10 and seed bank less than 03 seedsdm3 conversely under three annual cuts the african grass m minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation 5 to 25 and seed bank 1 to 4 seedsdm3 our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of p arachnoideum in atlantic forests however its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses therefore planting fastgrowing and droughttolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded neotropical forests 2022 elsevier bv,603

An agile approach for evaluating the environmental-economic performance of cropping systems at experimental stage: the case of Brazilian mango,purpose the lack of approaches to consider the economiclife cycle environmental performance of cropping systems at experimental stage and the absence of evaluations regarding alternative mango systems are issues addressed in this paper in this study an approach for assessing the environmentaleconomic performance of alternative crop systems at the experimental stage is proposed and applied to the mango experiment in brazil this approach may be used in other assessments of cropping systems at experimental stage methods the proposed approach encompasses three consecutive evaluations agronomic and environmentaleconomic initially the agronomic evaluation statistically compares the yield of alternative cropping systems treatments in the experiment next a treatment is selected among those with significant better yield and compared to the treatment representing the conventional system considering environmental and economic criteria the environmental criteria are the carbon and water footprints of the selected treatments according to iso 14067 and 14046 while the economic is profitability revenue minus costs with labor and inputs this approach was applied to evaluate an 8year mango experiment in the sao francisco valley brazil which intercropped mango trees with two types of plant mixtures cover crops with different plant mixes applying two soil management systems tillage and notillage results and discussion the agronomic assessment that statistically compared yields showed that four treatments t1 t2 t4 and t5 obtained higher yields than those representing the conventional system t3 and t6 treatment t4 was selected among the ones with higher yields and compared with t6 conventional system considering the economic and environmental criteria the economic analysis showed that in 30years expected orchard life time t4 generates a profit that is 44 higher than t6 regarding the environmental analysis t4 presents a 16 lower carbon footprint and from 16 to 435 lower water footprint than t6 according to the impact category considered the scenario where land use changed from an annual crop melon to mango orchard further reduced both carbon and water footprints of mangoes produced in t4 conclusions the application of the proposed approach to the mango experiment resulted in the reduction of time and data requirements when evaluating the economicenvironmental performance of mango alternative cropping systems allowing the selection of best performing treatment the assessment of economicenvironmental performance showed that treatments with plant mixtures used as cover crops between lines of mango trees independently of the type of mix used or the soil management applied enhance the overall performance of mango production 2020 springerverlag gmbh germany part of springer nature,630
Adoption of an improved fallow practice using Acacia auriculiformis on the Batéké Plateau in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,an improved fallow agroforestry practice that involves planting acacia auriculiformis trees to accelerate soil fertility recovery was taught to 306 farmers in mampu agroforestry zone on the batk plateau in the democratic republic of the congo from 1995 to 2001 our study 1 assessed the principal factors that determined the continued application of this practice by farmers and 2 identified the benefits and constraints perceived by those farmers who adopted the practice two decades ago we applied a mixed approach that combined quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation first a multiple linear regression model was constructed based on a survey of 121 farmers that adopted the new practice we subsequently conducted semistructured interviews with 12 adopters the regression models identified that the availability of labour based on the number of household members working in the fields best explained the continued use of the improved fallow practice p 00898 in the interviews revenue from the sale of charcoal and improvement in crop yields were cited as key benefits of improved fallow while the lack of nurseries for tree production and the problems of access to water were the main drawbacks mentioned by adopters the study results identify the principal factors influencing the adoption of this practice as well as the perception of farmers this information can be used to guide the dissemination of improved fallow practice to other communities on the batk plateau landscape 2019 springer nature bv,631
Vegetation structure across fire edges in a Neotropical rain forest,humaninduced wildfires are one of the greatest threats to tropical forest and are predicted to increase in importance due to altered regimes associated with climate change wildfires promote high tree mortality thus modifying forest structure and composition and lead to habitat loss and fragmentation wildfires may also have effects on the adjacent unburnt areas due to edge influence conversely proximity to unburnt forest stands may favor regeneration in the burnt areas we evaluated wildfire effects on the forest structure of brazilian atlantic forest remnants we established 244 plots along eight 360 mlong transects distributed among three burnt patches where we measured structural attributes of overstory understory and deadwood the wildfire promoted very high mortality of trees saplings and lianas changing substantially the forest structure our analyses showed clear differences between the burnt and unburnt areas but no clear gradients highlighting the incipient stage of edge influencerelated processes the neotropical bracken fern pteridium arachnoideum was dominant in the burnt areas which can possibly arrest secondary succession our results highlight the importance of wildfires as a menace to brazilian atlantic forests remnants as well as to tropical rainforests elsewhere an everrising concern in a future of increased fire frequency 2019 elsevier bv,632

"Age, extent and carbon storage of the central Congo Basin peatland complex",peatlands are carbonrich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of earths land surface1 but store onethird of soil carbon2 peat soils are formed by the buildup of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests23 here we present field measurements from one of the worlds most extensive regions of swamp forest the cuvette centrale depression in the central congo basin4 we find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 03 metres radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10600 years ago coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central africa at the beginning of the holocene5 the peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins and seem to be largely rainfed and ombrotrophiclike of low nutrient status systems although the peat layer is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 59 metres and a median depth of 20 metres by combining in situ and remotely sensed data we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145500 square kilometres 95 per cent confidence interval of 131900156400 square kilometres making the cuvette centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics this area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the congo basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent2 we estimate that the peatlands store approximately 306 petagrams 306 1015 grams of carbon belowground 95 per cent confidence interval of 63468 petagrams of carbona quantity that is similar to the aboveground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire congo basin6 our result for the cuvette centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent to 1047 petagrams of carbon minimum estimate of 696 petagrams of carbon maximum estimate of 1298 petagrams of carbon this stored carbon is vulnerable to landuse change and any future reduction in precipitation78 2017 macmillan publishers limited part of springer nature all rights reserved,641
Recovery of carbon stocks in deforested caatinga dry forest soils requires at least 60 years,caatinga forests occupy an area of around one million km2 in the semiarid region of northeast brazil these landscapes are undergoing rapid change because of accelerated deforestation for cultivation and firewood the capacity of caatinga forests to regenerate after clearing determines the magnitude of the carbon c sink in the soil and thus is fundamental information for developing management policies for longterm sustainability the objective of this study was to investigate c stocks and microbial activity in soils of dry caatinga forests that had undergone harvesting at different times in the past soils were collected from three depths 05 510 and 1020 cm within seven sites representing a sequence of years since cutting 05 6 9 12 25 50 and undisturbed at least 80 years since cutting samples from each depth interval were analyzed for total c concentration and stock humic substances labilec and microbial biomass c in addition indicators of microbiological activity such as basal respiration microbial quotient and metabolic quotient were determined for the two shallow layers the results showed that c stocks and microbiological activity were strongly influenced by forest cutting times and reflect significant c losses associated with this type of management they also suggest that reaccumulation of c following disturbance is slow those areas in which the vegetation has remained undisturbed for longer periods have larger c stocks indicating that longterm maintenance of vegetation increases c storage in soils for example 20 years after cutting the c concentrations in soil and humic fractions had recovered to only about 32 of the presumed maximum found for the 80year site the average time for c in soil and humic fractions to return to their initial values at these sites is estimated to be approximately 65 years even achieving 50 recovery would require at least 33 years between cutting campaigns our findings show that in the context of mitigating climate change on a global scale forest management entities should restrict cutting intervals in semiarid regions such as the caatinga to longer than 30 years to allow these soils to rebuild significant c stocks 2017 elsevier bv,642
Sensitivity and resistance of soil fertility indicators to land-use changes: New concept and examples from conversion of Indonesian rainforest to plantations,tropical forest conversion to agricultural land leads to a strong decrease of soil organic carbon soc stocks while the decrease of the soil c sequestration function is easy to measure the impacts of soc losses on soil fertility remain unclear especially the assessment of the sensitivity of other fertility indicators as related to ecosystem services suffers from a lack of clear methodology we developed a new approach to assess the sensitivity of soil fertility indicators and tested it on biological and chemical soil properties affected by rainforest conversion to plantations the approach is based on nonlinear regressions between soc losses and fertility indicators normalized to their level in a natural ecosystem biotic indicators basal respiration microbial biomass acid phosphatase labile soc pools dissolved organic carbon and light fraction and nutrients total n and available p were measured in ah horizons from rainforests jungle rubber rubber hevea brasiliensis and oil palm elaeis guineensis plantations located on sumatra the negative impact of landuse changes on all measured indicators increased in the following sequence forest jungle rubber rubber oil palm the basal respiration microbial biomass and nutrients were resistant to soc losses whereas the light fraction was lost stronger than soc microbial c use efficiency was independent on land use the resistance of c availability for microorganisms to soc losses suggests that a decrease of soc quality was partly compensated by litter input and a relative enrichment by nutrients however the relationship between the basal respiration and soc was nonlinear ie negative impact on microbial activity strongly increased with soc losses therefore a small decrease of c content under oil palm compared to rubber plantations yielded a strong drop in microbial activity consequently management practices mitigating soc losses in oil palm plantations would strongly increase soil fertility and ecosystem stability we conclude that the new approach enables quantitatively assessing the sensitivity and resistance of diverse soil functions to landuse changes and can thus be used to assess resilience of agroecosystems with various use intensities 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved,643

"A new insight in the structure, composition and functioning of central African moist forests",the greater part of the semideciduous moist forests of the congo basin has been given to logging companies for exploitation in the next decades very few of these forests will remain intact in this paper we aimed to identify largescale variations in the structure composition and functioning of african moist forests that could serve as a baseline for both management and conservation purposes commercial forest inventory data were assembled for 49711 05ha plots covering an area of more than six million hectares crossing the borders of cameroon central african republic and republic of congo floristic composition was analyzed for a subset of 176 genera reliably identified in the field three key functional traits of tropical trees regeneration guild leaf phenology and wood specific gravity were collected at the species level from various sources and assigned at the genus level we first investigated the main variations in forest structure and composition and identified seven forest types based on these variations differences in the percentage of pioneer and deciduous stems and mean wood specific gravity were tested between forest types most of the study area was composed of a mosaic of the structural variations of the forests characterized by the occurrence of celtis ulmaceae species which are mostly composed of frequent and abundant genera that formed the common floristic pool of the region secondary musanga moraceae forest is located in repeatedly disturbed areas along roads and around main cities mixed manilkara sapotaceae forest covers a huge area in the southern central african republic and in the northern republic of congo and monodominant gilbertiodendron fabaceae forest is sparsely distributed along rivers the contrasted structure composition and functioning of the forest types imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes and call for adapted management and conservation strategies 2014 elsevier bv,654
Detecting and quantifying forest change: The potential of existing C- and X-band radar datasets,this paper evaluates the opportunity provided by global interferometric radar datasets for monitoring deforestation degradation and forest regrowth in tropical and semiarid environments the paper describes an easy to implement method for detecting forest spatial changes and estimating their magnitude the datasets were acquired within spaceborne high spatial resolutions radar missions at nearglobal scales thus being significant for monitoring systems developed under the united framework convention on climate change unfccc the approach presented in this paper was tested in two areas located in indonesia and australia forest change estimation was based on differences between a reference dataset acquired in february 2000 by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm and tandemx mission tdm datasets acquired in 2011 and 2013 the synergy between srtm and tdm datasets allowed not only identifying changes in forest extent but also estimating their magnitude with respect to the reference through variations in forest height 2015 tanase et al this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited,655
Mesoscale gradients of herb richness and abundance in central Amazonia,there are few hypotheses to explain local understory diversity patterns there is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally here i examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale 64 km2 in a wet tropical forest and possible factors causing them herb richness diversity density and cover were measured in fiftynine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over reserva ducke manaus herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope marantaceae density and cover decreased density of sedges increased with altitude but did not vary with slope density and cover of marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas marantaceae richness decreased richness of both groups increased with cation content diversity increased with altitude for marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs such as the greater abundance of marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots where water availability is higher and probably also light and the greater richness of marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots the unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes instead of in bottomlands suggest that biotic or littermediated controls may be important to set these patterns 2006 the authors,656
Persistence Of Mechanical Interventions Effect For Soil Decompaction In No-Tillage Systems,compaction has become one of the main causes of soil degradation in agricultural areas it is directly related to the soil management system often requiring decompaction practices to mitigate the problem this study aimed to determine the duration of the effects of mechanical soil decompaction eg by plowing and chiseling associated with soil breaking devices on the seeders for example disks and diskripper to mitigate the compaction of soil under no tillage soil physical properties and the force exerted by the traction bar were evaluated the study was carried out in coxilha in the north region of rio grande do sul brazil 2810187 s 52223989 w on a red oxisol the experiment was installed in 2001 in an area for eight years under notillage nt in this area mechanical interventions of soil plowing and chiseling were annually performed prior to summer crop planting the treatments consisted of one control uninterrupted nt for 16 years and six nt periods 75 65 55 45 35 and 25 years after chiseling and plowing in the main plots in the subplots two fertilizer treatments were applied in the sowing furrow disks or diskripper the experiment was evaluated in a randomized block design in split plots and three replications results indicated the existence of soil compaction in the subsurface layer 715 cm evidenced by increases in soil density and reduction in soil total porosity and macroporosity in all treatments it was observed that the effects of mechanical intervention to mitigate compaction and improve the soil structure were ephemeral with a durability of up to two and a half years after chiseling for total porosity and macroporosity and for soil density in the plowing treatments for the other parameters these benefits were no longer detectable less than two and a half years after intervention mechanical intervention caused no alterations in the force exerted by the traction bar in comparison with the control however the soil breaking mechanism of the diskripper on the seeder was effective in altering the appraised parameters increasing soil macroporosity and reducing microporosity soil density and traction force thus mitigating soil compaction,657

Soil management and nitrogen fertilization for sprinkler-irrigated upland rice cultivars,the use of sprinkler irrigation for rice oryza sativa l crop is a relatively recent practice in brazil therefore crop soil and fertilization management are still not very well defined another problem is the inexistence of specific cultivars adapted to this cropping system this study aimed to evaluate sprinklerirrigated upland rice cultivars under different soil management practices and nitrogen sidedressing rates in relation to yield and grain quality a randomized block design was used arranged as a 3 x 3 x 5 factorial scheme totaling 45 treatments consisting of the combination of three rice cultivars primavera confiana and maravilha three soil management systems disk harrow levelling harrow moldboard plow levelling harrow and notill and five nitrogen rates applied as sidedressing 0 25 50 75 and 100 kg ha1 with four replicates the experiment was set up during the 19992000 and 20002001 cropping seasons in selvria ms brazil on a typic haplustox of clayey texture cultivars primavera and maravilha presented higher grain yield than confiana on the other hand the latter showed higher milled and head rice yields during seed processing soil tillage with the moldboard plow and notill interfered positively in the agronomic and productive characteristics of the crop in relation to milled rice yield tilling with the levelling disk moldboard plow showed better results in relation to notill nitrogen sidedressing did not interfere with the agronomic and productive characteristcs as well as with the milled rice yield of all cultivars 2003 scientia agricola all rights reserved,659
Economic assessment of mitigation options for enhancing and maintaining carbon sink capacity in Indonesia,land use landuse change and forestry lulucf projects may become eligible under article 12 of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc kyoto protocols clean development mechanism cdm some of the issues which need to be addressed include identifying the types of greenhouse gas ghg mitigation activities in lulucf which could be undertaken as cdm projects other issues involve evaluating the mitigation potential and cost effectiveness of the activities as well as their likely socioeconomic impacts and their influence on the national carbon c stock three broad categories of mitigation activities in lulucf analyzed in this study include managing c storage c conservation and carbon substitution the c intensity of the activities was estimated to range from 37 to 218 mg c per ha the highest is in reforested land with slow growing species and the lowest in shortrotation plantations at a real discount rate of 10 investment costs required to implement the mitigation activities ranged from us 007 to 088 per mg c with life cycle costs ranging from us 007 to 387 per mg c and benefits ranging from us 081 to 657 per mg c mitigation options with negative benefits are forest protection reforestation reduced impact logging and enhanced natural regeneration while those with positive benefits are short rotation timber plantation and bioenergy reforestation gave negative benefit since no revenue from wood as trees are left in the forest for conservation while reduced impact logging ril and enhanced natural regeneration enr gave negative benefits because additional cost required to implement the options could not be compensated by the increase in roundhardwood yield other factor is that the local price of roundhardwood is very low ie us160 per m3 while fob price is between 250400 us per m3 total area available for implementing mitigation options planting trees in 1997 was 31 million hectares 106 ha about 40 are critical lands 35 grasslands and 25 unproductive lands total area being considered for implementing the options under baseline governmentplans and mitigation scenarios in the period 20002030 is 126 163 and 236 106 ha respectively furthermore total area of production forest being considered for implementing reduced impact logging and enrichment planting under the tree scenarios is 9 26 and 16 106 ha respectively and that for forest protection is 21 37 31 106 ha respectively the cumulative investment for implementing all mitigation activities in the three scenarios was estimated at 595 892 and 1026 million us respectively national c stock under the baseline scenario will continuously decline through 2030 while under governmentplans and mitigation scenarios the carbon stock increases in 2030 national c stock of the government and mitigation scenarios is almost the same 13 higher than that of baseline however the increase in national carbon stock in both scenarios could not offset carbon emissions due to deforestation,660
Nutrient cycling in a high-altitude swamp forest,swamp forests are ecosystems restricted to hydromorphic soils which are subject to the presence of surface water due to upwelling of groundwater the diversity and establishment of plant communities depend on adaptability to conditions of flooding and low oxygen in the soil this study aimed to characterize aspects of n and p cycling in a swamp forest in itacolomi park minas gerais brazil by measuring parameters such as litterfall nutrient quality and decomposition of leaf litter during the period october 2006 to september 2007 mean annual litter production was 57 t ha1 with peak production in september the leaf fraction accounted for 57 of total litterfall and concentrations of n p and k were 126 0616 and 307 g kg1 respectively leafmass loss during litter decomposition was negatively correlated to soil water content varying between 292 and 462 the np ratio of leaf litter suggests that the vegetation grows under plimitation taking into account the evaluated parameters the swamp forest showed a slower rate of nutrient cycling mainly due to low litter nutrient quality and slower litter decomposition rate when compared with other wet tropical forests,661
Soil chemical profiles developed from pyrite-containing sediments under Banjarese agricultural practices in South Kalimantan,the reclamation of brackish sediments for agriculture involves the danger that pyrite minerals present in the deposits will be oxidized and produce unfavorable conditions for plant growth pyrite minerals are oxidized when the swamp is reclaimed by forest cutting canal excavation and destruction of the peat cover in south kalimantan banjarese people cultivate rice using a technique adapted to soils that originate from pyritecontaining sediments especially where nonacidic water for flushing the toxic materials is available however the agricultural land in areas with pyritecontaining sediments is a fragile system even the productive rice plots are constantly threatened by the sudden collapse of the delicate balance to understand the effect of the banjarese rice cultural practice on soil conditions in areas with pyritecontaining sediments land use and water management practices were observed in the field and eight auger samples were taken for laboratory analyses the results show that intensive leaching of the pyritecontaining sediments leads to the development of a specific soil chemical profile comprising an oxidized horizon an acidaccumulating horizon and a reduced horizon this paper presents details of soil development processes and soil management problems,662
