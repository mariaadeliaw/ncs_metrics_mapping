TI  - Total C and N storage and organic C pools of a Red-Yellow Podzolic under conventional and no tillage at the Atlantic Forest Zone, south-eastern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A 15-year experiment in a clayey Red-Yellow Podzolic in the tropical highlands of Vicosa, Brazil, was studied in 2000, aiming to evaluate the impact of different management systems ( no tillage, disk plowing, heavy scratcher + disk plowing, and heavy scratched) on the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and several organic carbon pools. A natural forest, adjacent to the experimental area, was used as reference. The greatest TOC and TN as well as microbial biomass C (C-MB), light fraction C (C-FL), and labile organic carbon ( CL) stocks were observed in the Atlantic Forest, compared with all other systems. The long-term cultivation (+/-70 years) of this area, prior to the installation of the experiment, has led to soil degradation, slowing the C recovery. No tillage had the higher C and N stocks and greater C-L pool at the surface (0 - 10 cm), indicating improvement in soil nutrient status, although none of the systems presented potential to sequester C-CO2. Sustainable tropical agricultural systems should involve high residue input and conservative soil management in order to act as a C-CO2 sink. The C stocks in the C-MB, C-FL, and C-L compartments were more reduced in relation to the natural vegetation with higher intensity management than the TOC stocks. This result indicates that these C compartments are more sensitive to changes in the soil management.

TI  - Effects of submergence in water on seed germination and vigor of the Copaifera lucens (Fabaceae) seedlings
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the tolerance of Copaifera lucens seeds to submersion in water to assess the use of this species for direct seeding in riparian forest restoration programs. Seeds were submerged in water for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 days or not submerged (control = 0 days of submergence). For the control and at the end of each period of submersion, germination and seedling vigor tests were carried out. For germination tests, seeds were sown in plastic pots containing sand and kept in laboratory conditions. The percentage of seed germination, the germination rate and the average germination time were analyzed. For seedlings, total biomass, leaf area, leaf mass per area and leaf area ratio were analyzed. Submersion time drastically affected the dissolved oxygen content and seed germination. Between 4 and 8 days of submersion there was a decrease from 83.8% to 15.6% in the germination percentage. No seed germination occurred after 16 days of submersion. Although there was a significant decrease in the percentage of seed germination between 4 and 8 days of submersion, seedling vigor was not affected. Seeds of this species were partially tolerant to submersion in water, suggesting that C. lucens is a promising species for direct seeding in riparian forest restoration projects.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from alternative futures of deforestation and agricultural management in the southern Amazon
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon is one of the most rapidly developing agricultural areas in the world and represents a potentially large future source of greenhouse gases from land clearing and subsequent agricultural management. In an integrated approach, we estimate the greenhouse gas dynamics of natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems after clearing in the context of a future climate. We examine scenarios of deforestation and postclearing land use to estimate the future (2006-2050) impacts on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the agricultural frontier state of Mato Grosso, using a process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model (TEM). We estimate a net emission of greenhouse gases from Mato Grosso, ranging from 2.8 to 15.9 Pg CO2-equivalents (CO2-e) from 2006 to 2050. Deforestation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions over this period, but land uses following clearing account for a substantial portion (24-49%) of the net greenhouse gas budget. Due to land-cover and land-use change, there is a small foregone carbon sequestration of 0.2-0.4 Pg CO2-e by natural forests and cerrado between 2006 and 2050. Both deforestation and future land-use management play important roles in the net greenhouse gas emissions of this frontier, suggesting that both should be considered in emissions policies. We find that avoided deforestation remains the best strategy for minimizing future greenhouse gas emissions from Mato Grosso.

TI  - Divergent accumulation of amino sugars and lignins mediated by soil functional carbon pools under tropical forest conversion
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical primary forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate and converted for other land uses which is expected to greatly influence soil carbon (C) cycling. However, our understanding of how tropical forest conversions affect the ac-cumulation of compounds in soil functional C pools remains unclear. Here, we collected soils from primary forests (PF), secondary forests (SF), oil-palm (OP), and rubber plantations (RP), and assessed the accumulation of plant-and microbial-derived compounds within soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate (POC) and mineral-associated (MAOC) or-ganic C. PF conversion to RP greatly decreased SOC, POC, and MAOC concentrations, whereas conversion to SF in-creased POC concentrations and decreased MAOC concentrations, and conversion to OP only increased POC concentrations. PF conversion to RP decreased lignin concentrations and increased amino sugar concentrations in SOC pools which increased the stability of SOC, whereas conversion to SF only increased the lignin concentrations in POC, and conversion to OP just increased lignin concentrations in POC and decreased it in MAOC. We observed di-vergent dynamics of amino sugars (decrease) and lignin (increase) in SOC with increasing SOC. Only lignin concentra-tions increased in POC with increasing POC and amino sugars concentrations decreased in MAOC with increasing MAOC. Conversion to RP significantly decreased soil enzyme activities and microbial biomasses. Lignin accumulation was associated with microbial properties, whereas amino sugar accumulation was mainly associated with soil nutri-ents and stoichiometries. These results suggest that the divergent accumulation of plant-and microbial-derived C in SOC was delivered by the distribution and original composition of functional C pools under forest conversions. Forest conversions changed the formation and stabilization processes of SOC in the long run which was associated with con-verted plantations and management. The important roles of soil nutrients and stoichiometry also provide a natural -based solution to enhance SOC sequestration via nutrient management in tropical forests.

TI  - Phytosociology of the shrub-arboreal stratum of the Ibura National Forest, Northeastern Brazil: are 35 years sufficient to promote the regeneration of a forest fragment?
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Among the various applications of phytosociology, the evaluation of natural regeneration is of great importance, mainly because it provides insights for ecological restoration. The objective of this study was to analyze the composition and phytosociological parameters of shrub and tree vegetation in areas of plantation of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) and areas of native forest in the Ibura National Forest, located in the Sergipe state of northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, 20 plots were sampled and all individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 8 cm were measured. Sampling revealed 821 individuals in the forest area and 1,000 in the eucalyptus area. These individuals represent 84 species and the areas presented a significant difference in species composition, with 61 in the eucalyptus area and 65 in the Forest area, and only 40 species were common to both areas. There was a predominance of pioneer individuals in the eucalyptus area. There also was a significant difference in basal area, relative density and relative dominance, but no significant differences were observed in average height. It was concluded that a period of 35 years is insufficient for the recovery of the eucalyptus area, which remains in a more initial successional stage than the forest area.

TI  - Low predictability in aboveground biomass accumulation in Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are high expectations about the role of active reforestation in mitigating climate change, by means of carbon sequestration and storage, fueling the carbon credit market. Carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or, at best, the expected size and wood density of planted trees. However, the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear, since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old, thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic, multifactor restoration outcome. We used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation in 30 Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites sharing the same climate, soil type, and restoration technique. We evaluated the entire age range of 1-19 years, and three age intervals, 1-3 years, 4-8 years, and over 9 years. AGB, basal area, and tree density increased considering all ages (1-19 years). Our results showed, however, that the AGB, tree density, and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years. Adjusted model r(2) values decreased with time, suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural, uncontrolled, and, to some extent, unknown factors. Although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of long-term carbon stocks based on tree planting, high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE LITTER AND SOIL SEED BANK TRANSPOSITION AS A FOREST RESTORATION OF DEGRADED AREAS METHODOLOGY
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the viability of the litter and soil seed bank transposition as a forest restoration of degraded areas methodology. The litter and soil samples of 1 x 1 m were collected at a depth of 5.0 cm in a secondary semideciduous forest in Vicosa, MG, Brazil. The litter and soil samples were deposited in seedbeds in which the superficial soil (10 cm) was previously removed. Three treatments were performed as well as a separate control with five repetitions, totaling 20 samples. The first treatment (T1) was the litter transposition only, the second treatment (T2) was the soil seed bank only, the third treatment (T3) was the transposition of the litter together with the soil seed bank and the control (T). During a period of six months, 327 individuals of trees and shrubs and 864 herbaceous individuals were identified. Among the tree and shrub species occurring in the samples, 74% were classified as pioneers, and 26% were classified as other ecological groups. The most abundant tree species were Cecropia hololeuca with 151 individuals. Among the herbs, Oxalis corniculata was the most abundant, with 329 individuals. The differences of density and species richness between the treatments were significant, with the greatest richness in treatment T3 and the greatest densities in treatments T2 and T3. Therefore, it is concluded that the transposition of the seed bank is a promising methodology to stimulate forest restoration in degraded areas, being more efficient when the superficial soil is used with the litter.

TI  - Dynamics of Natural Regeneration: Implications for Landscape Restoration in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to understand post-agricultural natural forest regeneration in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its possible role as a cost-effective, passive approach to forest restoration. The study characterized vegetation structure, floristic composition, and the dynamics of secondary forest chronosequences. Data were collected from 159 plots (10 x 10 m each) across forest remnants in Santa Catarina State, covering forest ages that ranged from 2 to 60 years of regeneration after swidden agriculture. Only areas with no signs of degradation were sampled in order to provide a description of vegetation characteristics that could be used to identify and monitor natural regeneration. A total of 11,455 woody plants were identified and classified into 334 species representing 71 families. As the succession process unfolds, the continuous turnover of species makes forests more diverse and structurally complex. Floristic similarity among forest types is observed during the early stages of succession, but decreases over time. Pioneer species dominate young secondary forests, representing about 40% of the basal area up to 10 years of regeneration. Shade-tolerant species start colonizing the sites at early ages; however, they become more important structural elements only after 30 years of succession. The observed patterns of forest structure and species diversity largely conform to the post-agricultural succession seen in many tropical forests. The high species diversity found in this study highlights the importance of natural regeneration as a strategy to restore ecosystems. Floristic data can be used as a reference for choosing suitable species for active restoration, as well as contributing to the design of integrated restoration strategies. We herein reinforce the potential of natural regeneration as part of large-scale restoration programs, which would be particularly attractive to family farmers by the low cost of supplies and labor.

TI  - Resource Availability and Use in Restored, Unmanaged, and Aquaculture Mangrove Ecosystems in Indonesia
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are some of the most productive on our planet but have declined globally by 30-50%. Many species rely on mangrove habitats; thus, their conversion to aquaculture farms has led to noticeable losses in commodities such as wild fish stocks. This study aimed to assess the influence of aquaculture and restoration projects on the ecosystem's ability to provide resources. We collected data on mangrove vegetation (i.e., biomass, richness, and abundance), soil nutrients (i.e., organic carbon, aluminium, and nitrogen), crab abundance, and fishing pressure at six sites. We set up 15 plots at each site and collected data between May and July 2023. Via generalised linear mixed models, we found that the abundance and richness of crabs was significantly higher in aquaculture plots than in non-aquaculture plots. Aquaculture plots had higher topsoil aluminium, higher topsoil and subsoil nitrogen, and lower topsoil carbon than non-aquaculture sites. Restored sites had less nitrogen in the topsoil than unmanaged sites. The biomass did not change between aquaculture, restored, and unmanaged plots. We found a negative correlation between crab abundance and richness and mangrove diameter at breast height (DBH), suggesting that the species of crabs present preferred areas with propagules for feeding (e.g., Grapsidae crabs). The content of nitrogen in the subsoil was positively correlated with mangrove richness, diversity, and height, suggesting the importance of nitrogen availability for mangrove growth. The content of aluminium in the subsoil was negatively correlated with the content of organic carbon in both the topsoil and subsoil, suggesting the detrimental effect of aluminium on the carbon cycle. Fishing practices were observed at all sites during the data collection period. Despite the lack of significant impact on most vegetation parameters and the limited differences between managed and unmanaged sites, key variables such as soil aluminium, carbon, and nitrogen contents and crab assemblages exhibited high variability, highlighting the complex interactions within mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Relationship between herbaceous vegetation and regeneration of woody species in abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Relationship between herbaceous vegetation and regeneration of woody species in abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil) - Deforestation and conversion of forests to pasture is one of the most degrading activities impacting the Atlantic Rain Forest. We analyzed pastures abandoned for 8, 14, 48 50 and 96 months in Antonina (Parana state; 25 degrees 19 degrees 15 '' S; 45 degrees 24'24 '' W) to verify if herb cover reduces the natural regeneration of the Atlantic forest. We identified species and assessed shoot biomass of herbaceous species (in 24 1 in 2 plots), and calculated the volume of all woody species (height >= 1m; in 24 25 m(2) plots). We collected 59 herbaceous species (1,062 individuals) most of which were allochthonous species (95%), including Brachiaria decumbens and B. humidicola. We also sampled 104 woody species (2,234 individuals). There were significant floristic and structural changes in the community during the first four years since the pasture was abandoned. Woody vegetation development was negatively related to herb species' biomass, Suggesting that grasses (B. decumbens) inhibited forest regeneration. Our results suggested that management, including Brachiaria slip removal, is necessary for the restoration of abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Forest region.

TI  - Understanding the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Deforestation Fires in Indonesia and Brazil in 2019 and 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation fires are hindering climate change mitigation efforts and compounding global environmental challenges. Indonesia and Brazil have experienced high rates of deforestation fires in recent years, with many of the fires burning in peatland-rich ecosystems. We quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the 2019 and 2020 deforestation fires in both countries and determine the share of emissions originating from peatlands. Specifically, we use publicly available data for deforested area estimates and quantify the above-ground biomass (AGB), dry matter, and peat soil emissions associated with these fires. We find that the cumulative emissions impact from deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil was 3.7 (& PLUSMN;0.4) and 1.9 (& PLUSMN;0.2) Gt CO(2)eq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Nearly half of this GHG impact can be attributed to emissions from peatlands. However, real-time monitoring tools can underestimate these emissions as fires in peatlands smolder underground and can go undetected by satellites. We compare our results with publicly available land-use and fire emissions data and find that the magnitude of underestimation is of the order of 200-300% for severe fire years and highest in the peatland-rich Brazilian Pantanal. We identify the gaps in current policies that are exacerbating the GHG and climate impacts of deforestation fires in Indonesia and Brazil and emphasize the need for regular pre- and post-fire ground measurement, transparent data sharing, and robust policy enforcement for effective forest and peatland protection.

TI  - Designing an optimized landscape restoration with spatially interdependent non-linear models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT

AB  - Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot drastically fragmented due to different land use practices. Our under-standing on the impacts of fragmentation and restoration practices on ecosystem functionality significantly increased during the last decades. However, it is unknown to our knowledge how a precision restoration approach, integrated with landscape metrics, will affect the decision-making process of forest restoration. Here, we applied Landscape Shape Index and Contagion metrics in a genetic algorithm for planning forest restoration in watersheds at the pixel level. We evaluated how such integration may configure the precision of restoration with scenarios related to land-scape ecology metrics. The genetic algorithm worked toward optimizing the site, shape, and size of forest patches across the landscape according to the results obtained in applying the metrics. Our results, obtained by simulations of scenarios, support aggregation of forest restoration zones as expected, with priority restoration areas indicated where most of the aggregation of forest patches occurs. Our optimized solutions for the study area (Santa Maria do Rio Doce Watershed) predicted an important improvement of landscape metrics (LSI = 44 %; Contagion/LSI = 73 %). Largest shifts are suggested based on LSI (i.e., three larger fragments) and Contagion/LSI (i.e., only one well-connected fragment) optimizations. Our findings indicate that restoration in an extremely fragmented landscape will promote a shift toward more connected patches and with reduction of the surface:volume ratio. Our work explores the use of genetic algorithms to propose forest restoration based on landscape ecology metrics in a spatially explicit innovative approach. Our results indicate that LSI and Contagion:LSI ratio may affect the choice concerning precise lo-cation of restoration sites based on forest fragments scattered in the landscape and reinforce the usefulness of genetic algorithms to yield an optimized-driven solution for restoration initiatives.

TI  - BIOMASS AND NUTRIENT ACCUMULATION OF TWO LEGUMINOUS TREES IN AN IMPROVED FALLOW IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The fallow vegetation is the main component of sequential agroforestry systems in Amazon rain forest. The progressive removal of soil nutrient by slash/mulch agriculture involves continuing losses in carbon and nutrient stocks, leading to decline in soil productivity, low regeneration ability and decrease of species diversity of fallow vegetation. The fallow vegetation management by introducing fast growing leguminous trees has the potential to accumulate more biomass and nutrients to serve the nutrient demands of crops and its management has been considered as a sustainable technology production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of low solubility of phosphorus fertilizer in the biomass and nutrient stocks of leguminous trees used in fallow improvement. The experiment was conducted for 23 months in a sequential agroforestry slash-and-mulch system in eastern Amazon forest. The species selected were tachi-branco-Sclerolobium paniculatum Vogel and inga-Inga edulis Mart. Biomass and nutrient stocks and nutrient concentrations of leaf, branch and trunk were estimated. Phosphorus fertilization had a positive effect on calcium concentration in the leaves and stocks of biomass and nutrient contents (phosphorus, calcium and magnesium) in the leaves of legume trees. Inga edulis showed higher levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations in leaves, while Sclerolobium paniculatuttm showed higher biomass and stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium in leaf, branch and trunk.

TI  - Fertilization Effects on Early Growth, Aboveground Biomass, Carbon Storage, and Leaf Characteristics of Eucalyptus pellita F. Muell. in South Sumatera
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fertilization is one of the nutrient management efforts that play an important role in improving the productivity of plantation forests. It was conducted to provide adequate nutrients for the plant at the initial growth period when the availability of soil nutrients is very limited. The optimum dose of fertilization for each plant is different depending on its requirement, climate, and soil properties. This study investigated the influence of fertilization on early growth, aboveground biomass, carbon storage, and leaf characteristics in Eucalyptus pellita in the sixth months after field establishment. An experiment comprising four treatments of fertilization, i.e., 0, 75, 133, and 167 kg ha(-1) of triple superphosphate 46% P2O5 was set up using randomized complete block design with five replications. Four indicators were selected to evaluate the early growth of E. pellita, namely survival rate, height, the collar of diameter, and crown projection area. Aboveground biomass and carbon storage of E. pellita were estimated in each component, covering stem, bark, branches, and leaves. The leaf characteristics of E. pellita were described by individual leaf area, individual leaf dry weight, specific leaf area, and leaf area index. Results showed that the different treatment of fertilization did not have a meaningful effect on survival rate, individual leaf area, and specific leaf area. The treatments presented a substantial effect on other indicators such as height, diameter, crown projection area, aboveground biomass, carbon storage, individual leaf dry weight, and leaf area index. Despite the fact that the highest mean of height and collar of diameter were observed in the dose of 167 kg ha(-1) the greatest average of aboveground biomass and carbon storage were noted in the rate of 133 kg ha(-1). Nevertheless, this study did not find a highly different performance of E. pellita between both treatments statistically.

TI  - Variations in tree community composition and structure in a fragment of tropical semideciduous forest in southeastern Brazil related to different human disturbance histories
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In an area of tropical seasonal semideciduous forest, the soil characteristics, floristic composition, physiognomic structure, and the distribution of three regeneration and three dispersal guilds were studied for four stands within the forest that had documented histories of varying degrees of human disturbance. The aim was to study forest regeneration in areas of preserved forest and secondary forest, with parts of both types of forest experiencing either 'intensive' or 'occasional' cattle trampling. The study was carried out in the Sebastiao Aleixo da Silva Ecological Station, Bauru, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Two stands were called 'secondary' because they corresponded to forest tracts that were felled and occupied by crops and pastures in the past and then abandoned to forest regeneration ca. 40 years before this study. The other two stands, called 'preserved', corresponded to areas of the fragment where the forest has been maintained with only minor human impacts. The arboreal component of the tree community (diameter at breast height or dbh greater than or equal to 5 cm) was sampled in 20 plots of 40 m x 40 m, and the subarboreal component (diameter at the base of the stem or dbs < 5 cm and height greater than or equal to 0.5 m) in subplots of 40 m x 2 m. Physiognomic features, such as canopy height and density of climbing plants, were registered all over a 5 m x 5 m gridline laid on the sample plots. Soil bulk samples were collected for chemical and textural analyses. Most detected differences contrasted the secondary to the preserved forest stands. The soils of the secondary stands showed higher proportions of sand and lower levels of mineral nutrients and organic matter than those of the preserved stands, probably due to higher losses by leaching and erosion. Compared to the secondary stands, the preserved ones had higher proportions of tall trees, higher mean canopy height, lower species diversity, higher abundance of autochorous and shade-tolerant climax species, and lower abundance of pioneer and light-demanding climax species. Despite the high proportion of species shared by the preserved and secondary stands (108 out of 139), they differed consistently in terms of density of the most abundant species. On the other hand, the secondary and preserved stands held similar values for tree density and basal area, suggesting that 40 years were enough to restore these features. Effects of cattle trampling on the vegetation were detected for the frequency of trees of anemochorous and zoochorous species, which were higher in the stands under occasional and intensive cattle trampling, respectively. The density of thin climbers was lower in the stands with intensive trampling. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Indicators of restoration success in riparian tropical forests using multiple reference ecosystems
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration by planting trees often accelerates succession, but the trajectories toward reference ecosystems have rarely been evaluated. Using a chronosequence (4-53 years) of 26 riparian forest undergoing restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we modeled how the variables representing forest structure, tree species richness and composition, and the proportion of plant functional guilds change through time. We also estimated the time required for these variables to reach different types of reference ecosystems: old-growth forest (OGF), degraded forest, and secondary forest. Among the attributes which follow a predictable trajectory over time are: the basal area, canopy cover, density and tree species richness, as well as proportions of shade tolerant and slow growing species or individuals. Most of the variation in density of pteridophythes, lianas, shrubs and phorophythes, proportion of animal-dispersed individuals, rarefied richness and floristic similarity with reference ecosystems remain unexplained. Estimated time to reach the reference ecosystems is, in general, shorter for structural attributes than for species composition or proportion of functional guilds. The length of this time varies among the three types of reference ecosystems for most attributes. For instance, tree species richness and proportion of shade tolerant or slow growing individuals become similar to secondary forests in about 40 years, but is estimated to take 70 years or more to reach the OGF. Of all the variables considered, canopy cover, basal area, density, and richness of the understory-by their ecological relevance and predictability-are recommended as ecological indicators for monitoring tropical forest restoration success.

TI  - Key species selection for forest restoration after bauxite mining in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bauxite mining has caused serious damage on local ecosystems and landscapes in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Considering these issues, the objectives of this study were to determine key species and their ecological characteristics that can contribute to forest restoration after bauxite mining. Key species are those with high frequency and abundance in different stages of vegetation succession. Data were obtained from forest inventories before forest slash down to extract bauxite and later subjected to factor analysis. The Phytosociological and Socioeconomic Index (PSI) was calculated with the following variables: abundance, frequency, dominance, live aerial biomass, commercial value of wood, and non-timber forest products of each species. The data comprised 24,600 individuals distributed in 462 species, 224 genera, and 62 families. Seventeen species, selected by PSI, were the most representative to restore areas after bauxite mining in the Eastern Amazon. The families with the highest richness were Lecytidaceae, Sapotaceae, and Fabaceae, representing 64.70% of the key species. Regarding abundance, the families Lecytidaceae, Urticaceae, and Fabaceae accounted for more than 75% of the individuals belonging to the key species. The 17 selected species belonged to the following ecological groups: late secondary (10), climax (5), initial secondary (1), and pioneer (1). The ecological knowledge of the selected species is important to plan and establish forest restoration projects, since ecological processes and functions can evolve n a more rapid and effective way.

TI  - Long-term changes in organic matter stocks and quality in an Oxisol under intensive vegetable cultivation
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) reserves reflect the impacts of land use and management. The objective was to evaluate the changes in organic matter stocks and quality in an Oxisol under intensive vegetable cultivation in the Brazilian Cerrado region. Four areas were selected: one under Cerrado vegetation (CV) and three under vegetable production with 15 (VG(15)), 20 (VG(20)) and 30 (VG(30)) years of cultivation. Soil samples were collected for the determination of total C (TC) and total N (TN) in soil organic matter fractions and the biochemical composition of particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MOM). The smallest C stocks were observed on VG(30), whereas the CV area had the highest values. The TN stocks were similar across treatments. The levels of labile C decreased with cultivation time. Increases and reductions in carbohydrate and lignin ratios in POM and MOM occurred in VG(15) and VG(20), respectively, with POM being more sensitive to changes in land use. There was greater similarity between VG(15) and VG(20), but differences between CV and VG(30). There was a correlation between higher labile reserves (labile C and carbohydrates) and areas with shorter land use and between C-mic and agricultural use for 30 years. There was also a negative correlation between soil nutrients and the total and MOM C and N contents as well as the MOM carbohydrate levels, and there was also a negative correlation between C-mic and TC. The intensive use of Oxisols promoted a reduction in soil organic matter stocks and altered their quality.

TI  - Forest Restoration Evaluation Through Indicators in Areas of Bauxite Mining
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of Para ranks second in Brazilian mineral production, where bauxite accounts for 84% of total mineral extraction, with negative impacts on the environment as a result. The determination of objectives and targets using environmental indicators as a tool to evaluate forest restoration processes is essential in the recovery of these exploited areas. This study aimed at evaluating the efficiency of forest restoration techniques by means of 13 qualitative and quantitative indicators for monitoring post-bauxite mining operations. Permanent plots were implanted in revegetated areas with the use of two techniques: planting of seedlings and stewarding of natural regeneration. It is concluded that the techniques are efficient for the recovery of forested area. However, natural regeneration showed greater efficiency for restoration for Density, Erosion and Exotic Species indicators. Still, natural regeneration should not be the sole option in the processes of ecosystem restoration, since planting proved to be more efficient for some indicators.

TI  - Vegetation restoration is associated with increasing forest width
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and assessment reveal important information about restoration areas and can also be useful for understanding ecological processes such as succession and species-area relationships. Herein, we investigated whether the time after restoration determines the similarity between restoration forests and reference ecosystems, and whether the age and width of the forest as well as the surrounding forest cover have an influence on forest restoration. The tree stratum, seed rain, and regenerating stratum were monitored in a reference ecosystem and four 10-year and 20-year-old restoration forests of different widths in southeastern Brazil. We verified that both 10- and 20-year-old restoration forests were like the reference ecosystem in the species richness, diversity, number of individuals, and functional groups of the tree stratum and seed rain. However, the floristic composition of the three strata evaluated plus the number of regenerating plants were lower in the restoration forests than in the reference ecosystem, which may be due to the agricultural matrix where the restoration forests were inserted. We also found that most of the ecological indicators were associated with increasing forest width meaning that wider strips can recover more vegetation attributes. The study indicates that various indicators can be recovered within a decade of active restoration (seedling planting) in the tropics. The regenerating stratum however may require more than two decades to recover. As the restoration was associated with increasing forest width, restoration practitioners should restore wider areas so that more biological groups can be recovered.

TI  - A common-sense approach to tropical peat swamp forest restoration in Southeast Asia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are found mainly in Southeast Asia and especially Indonesia. A total of 61% were lost between 1990 and 2015 and 6% remained in a pristine condition by 2015. Tropical peat swamps store vast amounts of carbon in their peat, but peat degradation, through drainage and fire, leads to high greenhouse gas emissions. This is gaining much international attention and, with it, policy initiatives and funding for restoration from local to landscape scales are being promoted. Unfortunately, although there is a now strong desire and need for TPSF restoration, methods are lacking. Ecological understanding is still at an early stage, and, even more so, in its applied use. There is an imbalance between the activities of TPSF restoration and sound ecological application. Furthermore, while many activities are underway and knowledge is being gained, these techniques are yet to be published. This article has been written to provide a common-sense, practical guide to tropical peatland forest restoration which summarizes what we know to date, while acknowledging the gaps in our understanding. Topics covered include species selection, land assessment, land selection, and appropriate nursery, transplanting, and monitoring methods. The authors make no apologies that in places this reads like a manual as, given the importance of tropical peatland recovery and the recent attention and funding opportunities available, it is essential we now provide techniques to restoration practitioners working on the ground, and a basic common-sense approach must be the starting point.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes partially reduce the net gains in carbon sequestration in mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is interest in assessing the potential climate mitigation benefit of coastal wetlands based on the balance between their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration. Here we investigated soil GHG fluxes (CO2 2 and CH4) 4 ) on mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and across common land use impacts including shrimp farms and a pasture. We found greater methane fluxes near the Amazon River mouth (1439 to 3312 mu g C m- 2 h-1),-1 ), which on average are equivalent to 37% of mangrove C sequestration in the region. Soil CO2 2 fluxes were predominant in mangrove forests to the East of the Amazon Delta. Land use change shifted mangroves from C sinks (mean sequestration of 12.2 +/- 1.4 Mg CO2e 2 e ha- 1 yr-1)- 1) to net GHG sources (mean loss of 8.0 +/- 3.3 Mg CO2e 2 e ha- 1 yr-- 1 ). Our data suggests that mangrove forests in the Amazon can aid decreasing the net annual emissions in the Brazilian forest sector in 9.7 +/- 0.8 Tg CO2e 2 e yr-- 1 through forest conservation and avoided deforestation.

TI  - The biogeography of the Amazonian tree flora
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the geographical variation in tree species composition across Amazonian forests and show how environmental conditions are associated with species turnover. Our analyses are based on 2023 forest inventory plots (1ha) that provide abundance data for a total of 5188 tree species. Within-plot species composition reflected both local environmental conditions (especially soil nutrients and hydrology) and geographical regions. A broader-scale view of species turnover was obtained by interpolating the relative tree species abundances over Amazonia into 47,441 0.1-degree grid cells. Two main dimensions of spatial change in tree species composition were identified. The first was a gradient between western Amazonia at the Andean forelands (with young geology and relatively nutrient-rich soils) and central-eastern Amazonia associated with the Guiana and Brazilian Shields (with more ancient geology and poor soils). The second gradient was between the wet forests of the northwest and the drier forests in southern Amazonia. Isolines linking cells of similar composition crossed major Amazonian rivers, suggesting that tree species distributions are not limited by rivers. Even though some areas of relatively sharp species turnover were identified, mostly the tree species composition changed gradually over large extents, which does not support delimiting clear discrete biogeographic regions within Amazonia.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional diversity of bird communities in mining areas undergoing passive and active restoration in eastern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advance of land-use change processes in the Amazon rainforest has modified its natural landscape, resulting in losses of biodiversity and ecological functions. Under this scenario, some reforestation methods have been proposed and tested in degraded areas aiming to reverse environmental damage. We assess the efficiency of three reforestation methods by investigating the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds in a post-mining landscape located in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We counted birds in 56 sites located in both forest and areas under the process of ecological restoration through natural regeneration, planting seedlings, and nucleation. Species composition and richness differed significantly between forests and areas under recovery. Nucleation showed distinct species composition from planting seedlings or natural regeneration areas, which can be explained by the difference in environmental structure in the areas recovering by this method. Although age did not influence species richness, we observed different species composition between old and young areas that received planting of seedlings. In general, we found no differences in functional diversity and functional richness between the methods of recovery. We conclude that the three recovery strategies evaluated herein showed a similar efficiency. However, it is necessary to consider that perhaps eight years is a short period to observe significant differences in the structure of the areas recovered by the different methods and, consequently, the structure of bird communities. Also, the diversity patterns of the current bird communities located in the post-mining areas were far from those found in forest areas, indicating the need for maintaining long-term recovery programs.

TI  - Growth and survival of potential tree species for carbon-offset in degraded areas from southeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil must restore 12 million hectares of degraded areas by 2030 to meet its goal of the Paris Global Climate Agreement (PGCA). In view of this, the development of mixed planting projects related to carbon-offset in degraded areas is increasing, which demonstrates environmental and social responsibility of corporate and governmental organizations. Despite the great potential of mixed restoration plantations to mitigate climate change, Brazil must overcome major challenges in achieving the ratified goals of the PGCA as well as the effectiveness of its carbon-offset projects. In this context, this study has focused on the evaluation of the growth and survival of tree species in a carbon-offset plantation from a degraded area in southeastern Brazil. Five-hundred-and-nine seedlings (15 forest species) were planted in a completely randomized design. Diameter at the soil level and height of individuals were measured at 40 months. Three individuals of each species were selected and was scaling by a non-destructive method. Timber volume was estimated from the sum of the volume of the sections of the individuals, obtained by the Smalian formula. The average annual carbon increment of the individuals was estimated by the equation adjusted from the Schumacher & Hall model. The potential of carbon-offset of the tested plants was evaluated from the SP and mu C analysis. The REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood)/BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) method was used to predict mu C values for species ordering with carbon -offset potential. Survival was 47.54% at 40 months. The carbon stock of the planting was 2.60 +/- 6.2 Kg C individual(-1), and the average annual increase in carbon (AAIC) was 0.78 Kg C individual(-1) year(-1). The AAIC value was lower than the average value stipulated for carbon-offset projects (6.0 Kg CO2 individual(-1) year(-1)). Pioneer species contributed more to carbon storage than non-pioneer species.

TI  - Acai palm management disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank of an Amazonian estuarine forest
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The exploitation of non-timber forest products has been proposed as a sustainable way to exploit tropical forests, but such an opportunity remains to be proved. Here, we examine the impact of intensive acai palm (Euterpe oleracea) management on the seed rain and soil seed bank in an estuarine forest landscape with a long history of forest management by locals in the Amazon region. Seed rain (100 80 cm(2) collectors) and soil seed bank (100 30 cm(2) samples) were monitored through a year across 20 forest stands, covering a gradient of acai stem density (50-3575 acai stems per ha). Seed rain and bank were dominated by acai seeds (85.5%-85.8%) and by excluding them, seed rain and bank were low density and species poor, capturing a tiny subset from the local (17.91%-19.40%) and landscape woody flora (11.82%-14.55%). Moreover, autochthonous and vertebrated-dispersed predominated as well as those from tree species considered useful by locals. Overall, acai stem density positively affected acai seed abundance in the seed rain and negatively affected seed pools in the bank in relation to abundance of seeds and vertebrated dispersed, while adult tree species richness and density and accessibility to forest stands were associated with more diversified seed pools. Thereby, forest stands are exposed to different levels of acai management (high vs. low intensity) supported taxonomically distinct seed pools. Our results suggest that acai intensification disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank with potential impacts on forest regeneration and the forest integrity standards required to consider acai fruit production as sustainable according to current legislation.

TI  - Suggesting priority areas in the buffer zone of Serra do Brigadeiro State Park for forest restoration compensatory to bauxite mining in Southeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prioritizing is essential to optimize resource allocation and restoration benefits. Bauxite mining is an important economic activity in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil. The exploitation process of this ore creates demands for compensatory forest restoration, which may be directed to key areas for conservation such as the Buffer Zone of the Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (BZ-SBSP). The objective of this study was to propose a new application of Multicriteria Evaluation based on Geographic Information Systems (MCE-GIS) to suggest priority areas for compensatory forest restoration in BZ-SBSP by using criteria important at the landscape level and in the field. The modeling of priority areas followed a suitability scale approach, which varied from 0 to 255, using five factors: permanent preservation areas, slope, land use and land cover, distance from conserved forest fragments and ecological corridors. The factors were aggregated under three different risk scenarios: Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), low risk Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) and high-risk OWA. Suitability increased with the risk assumed in the analysis. The area corresponding to the very high priority class increased from 0.31% in the most conservative scenario to 10.72% in the riskiest scenario. The high-risk OWA scenario can be considered the best alternative for presenting a greater number of viable options and high suitability in at least some factors. The maps generated in this study may support multiple stakeholders to identify and direct resources to high priority sites. It is important to highlight that a set of economic, social, and technical factors may still restrict the restoration of an area indicated as high priority. Thus, this study can be considered as general guidelines for restoration planning, suggesting areas that should result in greater benefits derived from forest restoration and in greater success of the projects, when considering the landscape of interest, its integrity and other relevant aspects that should be considered in a restoration project.

T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species that produce resources for fauna are recommended for forest restoration plantings to attract pollinators and seed dispersers; however, information regarding the flowering and fruiting of these species during early growth stages is scarce. We evaluated the reproductive phenology of animal-dispersed tree species widely used in Atlantic Forest restoration. We marked 16 animal-dispersed tree species in 3- to 8-year-old forest restoration plantings in Itu-Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. We noted the age of the first reproductive event, flowering and fruiting seasonality, percentage of trees that reached reproductive stages, and intensity of bud, flower, and fruit production for each species. Flowering and fruiting are seasonal for most species; only two,Cecropia pachystachyaandFicus guaranitica,exhibited continuous flowering and fruiting throughout the year; we also identifiedSchinus terebinthifoliaandDendropanax cuneatusfruiting in the dry season during resource scarcity. Therefore, we recommend all as framework species, that is, species that are animal-dispersed with early flowering and fruiting potential, for forest restoration. Further, we recommend identifying and planting similar animal-dispersed tree species that produce fruits constantly or in the dry season to maximize fauna resource availability throughout the year in tropical forest restoration plantings. in Portuguese is available with online material

TI  - Assessment of the nursery species pool for restoring landscapes in southeastern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has committed to fulfilling international restoration goals and to enforcing environmental legislation that will require private landowners to undertake ecological restoration of 21 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes. To support a broad range of restoration practices, a well-established supply chain capable of representing regional plant diversity is essential. This study investigated the restoration species pool in native plant nurseries in Sao Paulo state, located in southeastern Brazil, and evaluated their geographic distribution, similarity of their plant stocks, and the proportion of species represented from regional floras. Despite a lack of technical assistance and a significant presence of nonnative species (126 species, average 7.5 species/nursery), we found an impressive native species richness in plant nurseries (561 species, average 86.4 species/nursery) from both the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado domains, representing 38-44% of regional floras. There was a huge bias toward tree and shrub species (96.6%) and an absence or underrepresentation of other growth forms, as well as of savanna specialists, animal-dispersed, and threatened species. The dissimilarity of species observed among the different nurseries surveyed highlights their role in representing regional diversity, which reflects their regional seed collection practices. Effective assistance and training are essential to address issues related to misidentification of species, underrepresentation of most functional plant groups, and the presence of nonnative species, as well as to support the supply chain, which is currently undergoing a market downturn.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the dynamics and distribution of native species and their interaction with ecological variables are important aspects for definition of restoration strategies and management of native forests. Thus, this paper aims to study the relation between the distribution of Escallonia bifida in relation to environmental variables in fragment of Deciduous Forest in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul. Were evaluated four sampling classes to check the density and distribution of Escallonia bifida in the study area, including arboreous stratum (Class IV ((CBH >= 15), sampled in 16 plots of 10 x 10 m(2) and 64 subplots of 5 x 5 m(2) for class III (5.1 >= CBH <= 14.9 cm). Were allocated 64 subplots of 5 x 5 m (2) for class II (1 <= CBH >= 5 cm) and 256 subplots of 2 x 2 m(2) for class I (DGH >= 1 cm, H >= 30 cm) to evaluated regeneration stratum. Escalonia bifida presents general behavior in terms of soil conditions and proved to be related to higher luminosity areas. These characteristics provide the species potential for use in ecological restoration.

TI  - Ecofunctional Traits and Biomass Production in Leguminous Tree Species under Fertilization Treatments during Forest Restoration in Amazonia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Choosing the correct species and fertilization treatments is a determining factor in the success of forest restoration. Methods: A field study was conducted in a degraded area near the Balbina hydroelectric dam in Amazonas State (AM), Brazil, to evaluate two hypotheses: (i) leguminous tree species exhibit differences in growth, leaf nutrient content, and photosynthetic nutrient use efficiencies; and (ii) differences in these characteristics depend on the fertilization treatments to which the species have been subjected. Dipteryx odorata, Inga edulis and Schizolobium amazonicum were subjected to the following treatments: (T1) unfertilized control; (T2) post-planting chemical fertilization; (T3) post-planting organic fertilization and (T4) combined chemical and organic post-planting fertilization. Results: In general, I. edulis had the highest absolute growth rate of biomass under all of the fertilization treatments. I. edulis and S. amazonicum showed the highest growth rates under the T4 treatment. D. odorata showed the greatest responses under the T2 and T4 treatments. Native leguminous trees with higher photosynthetic performance and better nutrient use efficiency exhibited greater growth and biomass production. Conclusion: The results suggest that an adequate balance between leguminous species selection and fertilization will aid in the success of forest restoration in Amazonia.

TI  - Plant vegetative propagation plays a considerable role in the regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture in Caatinga dry forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture is a common practice in dry forests worldwide. Understanding the relative importance of different regeneration mechanisms following this disturbance provides insights into forest regeneration dynamics and resilience. We assessed differences in structural components, the relative contribution of vegetative and sexual reproduction, and the taxonomic composition of woody assemblages among different habitats in a Brazilian Caatinga dry forest after slash-and-burn agriculture. We assessed vegetation parameters (i.e., basal area, height, species richness, and the frequency of each regeneration mechanism) in recently abandoned fields, regenerating forest stands and old-growth forest stands. Overall, trees originates from root suckers accounted for at least 40% of the individuals, stems, and basal areas across the habitats. The structure of regenerating stands was similar to old-growth stands except for species composition, total number of roots, and number of primary roots. The aboveground basal area varied in total values, but not averages, among habitats, indicating a rapid recovery of aboveground biomass after slash-and-burn agriculture. Conversely, recently abandoned fields had higher belowground basal area and basal area of primary roots, revealing that the trees in these habitats emit more roots even with fewer individuals. There was a high degree of species turnover among the habitats, probably due to both species selection by farmers and environmental effects. Nevertheless, the dominant species presented both regeneration mechanisms across the habitats. Our findings thus show that the Caatinga dry forest regeneration considerably relies on the ability of woody plant species to emit root suckers in addition to sexual reproduction, which should be considered for better management practices as slash-and-burn agriculture is and will continue to be practiced.

TI  - Different Species Proportions Influence Silvicultural Heterogeneity of Trees in a Restoration of a Ombrophilous Dense Forest in Lowlands
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to generate strategies for the use of native species for ecological restoration, this paper presents the effects resulting from planting with facilitating tree species, in different proportions, after 13 years of forest restoration, in an area previously used for cattle buffaloes. The implantation was carried out in the Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the Lowlands, in the Atlantic Rainforest biome of the coastal plain of the state of Parana and consisted of the plantation of 10 native species, distributed in two treatments: equal (A) and unequal (B) proportions of trees per species. After conducting a forest census, it was identified that the silvicultural expression of the facilitating tree species in the treatments differed significantly, and proportion A contributed to a scenario with greater silvicultural heterogeneity in the areas, which may be beneficial to the evolution of the ecological dynamics of the forest restoration process. In addition, the monitoring of Alchornea glandulosa, Inga edulis, and Myrsine coriacea expressed better development in the area and high resilience to the environmental adversities arising from the cattle ranching activity previously carried out, especially in relation to invasive grasses; therefore, they are recommended for use in the forest restoration of associated ecosystems.

TI  - Practical critique: Bridging the gap between critical and practice-oriented REDD plus research communities
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is an ambitious global programme oriented towards improving forest carbon management. It aims to attract new sources of green' capital to fund emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management. REDD+ is transforming forest conservation, as a diverse array of new stakeholders become involved. Not surprisingly, REDD+ has proved divisive, as critics concern themselves with issues of power, justice, and commodification, while practice-oriented researchers tackle similar issues from different perspectives, focusing on benefit sharing, safeguards, additionality, measuring and verification. In this paper we explore the different roles of critical and practical research, and argue that there is a need for greater sharing of knowledge across current divides. We draw on our own experiences of conducting a research project on REDD+ in Indonesia that involved critical and practice-oriented researchers. We argue that critical research disconnected from practical matters can have perverse outcomes for practitioners who are ultimately working towards similar goals; while uncritical practice-oriented research has the potential to lead to a dilution of core values of environmental justice and conservation. In contrast, forms of practical critique provide ways of researching REDD+ that have practical value while maintaining critical insights.

TI  - Controls over foliar N:P ratios in tropical rain forests
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen : phosphorus ( N: P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N: P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N: P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N: P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N: P values differed by 25% between wet and dry seasons. The N: P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N: P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N: P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N: P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.

M3  - Article
AB  - Biotic interactions between pioneer and late-successional species may affect the spatial arrangement of the individuals in plant communities resulting in positive or negative patterns of association. Studies that analyze the plant colonization patterns in areas of natural forest regeneration are important to ecological restoration projects. The aim of this work is to investigate the population structure and the spatial distribution of Podocarpus lambertii (Podocarpaceae) in a restoration area, verifying the effect of pioneer plant species on P lambertii recruitment. The work was performed in a 1 ha degraded area in the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil. In contiguous plots of 10 x 10 m all individuals of P lambertii and adult individuals of the pioneer species Baccharis uncinella and Vemonia discolor were mapped and measured. The P lambertii population maintained itself stable during the study period, with the number of individuals in each size class reasonably constant. Juveniles of P lambertii were negatively associated with the pioneer B. uncinella indicating a competitive interaction, and were positively associated with V. discolor individuals, indicating facilitation. These results may contribute to the development of management techniques for the restoration of degraded areas in southem Brazil.

TI  - Forest regeneration may reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of a tropical hotspot
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Methods We built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on Species Distribution Models (SDM) which employed 79,462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios. SDM were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we assessed the species' risk of extinction based on the species-area relationship. Results Without considering the effects of climate change, the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 72.5% (SD = 8%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species, which may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4% (SD = 9.3%) in their current potential distribution areas. BAF regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate scenario, 3.4% of species may become extinct, but we show that large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions Despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67% of the studied species, which would increase the risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting large-scale BAF restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss.

TI  - Pinus elliottii Engelm as facilitator of riparian forest regeneration in savanna region, Assis, SP, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in a riparian area of Cerrado (savanna) in order to verify if a native plant community is positively or negatively influenced by reforestation with a fast growing exotic species (Pinus elliottii Engelm), on the basis of the ecological processes involved. Four treatments were compared: Pinus trees planted at 3 x 3 m, 3 x 2 m and 2 x 2 m, and a control (not planted). Every treatment consisted of four replications in randomized blocks and in 16 plots set along the stream. Variables related to growth for both planted and native species were evaluated, as well as the number of native species regenerating, dispersal syndrome, and also the ground cover by grasses. After eleven years from the beginning of the experiment, the higher the density of Pinus, the higher the density, number of species and diversity of native plants regenerating. Therefore the exotic trees facilitated the regeneration processes of native species. Analysis of explanatory variables showed that such facilitation was due to an indirect effect of the shading by Pinus trees, which reduced ground grass cover and prevented the inhibitory effect over plant community regeneration and growth. Further evaluations to detect competition between Pinus trees and the native community would be necessary to check if the facilitation effects persist in the long term.

TI  - Tree diversity, composition, forest structure and aboveground biomass dynamics after single and repeated fire in a Bornean rain forest
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires remain a devastating phenomenon in the tropics that not only affect forest structure and biodiversity, but also contribute significantly to atmospheric CO2. Fire used to be extremely rare in tropical forests, leaving ample time for forests to regenerate to pre-fire conditions. In recent decades, however, tropical forest fires occur more frequently and at larger spatial scales than they used to. We studied forest structure, tree species diversity, tree species composition, and aboveground biomass during the first 7 years since fire in unburned, once burned and twice burned forest of eastern Borneo to determine the rate of recovery of these forests. We paid special attention to changes in the tree species composition during burned forest regeneration because we expect the long-term recovery of aboveground biomass and ecosystem functions in burned forests to largely depend on the successful regeneration of the pre-fire, heavy-wood, species composition. We found that forest structure (canopy openness, leaf area index, herb cover, and stem density) is strongly affected by fire but shows quick recovery. However, species composition shows no or limited recovery and aboveground biomass, which is greatly reduced by fire, continues to be low or decline up to 7 years after fire. Consequently, large amounts of the C released to the atmosphere by fire will not be recaptured by the burned forest ecosystem in the near future. We also observed that repeated fire, with an inter-fire interval of 15 years, does not necessarily lead to a huge deterioration in the regeneration potential of tropical forest. We conclude that burned forests are valuable and should be conserved and that long-term monitoring programs in secondary forests are necessary to determine their recovery rates, especially in relation to aboveground biomass accumulation.

TI  - Locating REDD: A global survey and analysis of REDD readiness and demonstration activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD/REDD+) have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics. In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land. The results also reveal a bias against Africa and toward Latin America. Unless this pattern is countered, REDD and REDD+ may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support.

TI  - Silvicultural interventions and agroforestry systems increase the economic and ecological value of Bertholletia excelsa plantations in the Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bertholletia excelsa is a native tree of the Amazon that has great economic importance e in producing multiple products (wood, nuts, and oil). It has an important role in the carbon cycle in the Amazon basin. Its ecophysiological characteristics indicate that it can be part of various tree-planting systems. We have compiled important information on B. excelsa growing in forest restoration, forest enrichment plantations, pure plantations, and agroforestry systems to assess how the species responds to silvicultural interventions. Plantation studies on B. excelsa are relevant in implementing sustainable forestry systems in the Amazon region. Silvicultural interventions are crucial tools to ensure greater productivity, increase production capacity, and reduce cost and return time. Bertholletia excelsa is usually recommended for planting in agroforestry systems because of its physiological plasticity and wood and non-timber production, providing employment and income with a significant social impact in the field. Bertholletia excelsa can be successfully planted to restore degraded environments with satisfactory survival rates linked to physiological strategies. The species responds to spacing, fertilization, and thinning treatments demonstrating the potential for increasing both biomass production and yields of nuts.

TI  - Performance of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. in subtropical forest restoration
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the initial development of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. in a reforestation experiment in the southwestern region of Parana State, Southern Brazil. In a 70 native tree species plantation (3x2 m spacing) data were collected biannually, up to 48 months, from 72 individuals of Guazuma ulmifolia. The species performance was evaluated regarding its survival (96%), root collar diameter (6.79 cm), total height (12.84 m), crown projection area (14.36 m(2)) and crown volume (49.86 m(3)). The species growth at the age of 48 months, associated to its high survival and sprouting rates, tells of excellent behavior in the region, and it could be highly recommended as a shading species for fast canopy fulfillment in forest restoration projects, especially in regions with frost occurrence.

TI  - Restoration of a riparian forest: analysis of the effective productivity of operations under conditions of uncertainty
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainties related to the operations of models for forest restoration can include edaphic-climatic conditions, seedling species and quality, technology levels of equipment and qualification of workers, precedents of operation times, and, consequently: of effective productivity. Thus, this study aimed at ascertaining whether the adoption of seedlings produced in different containers can affect the effective productivity of forest restoration operations. A study of the times of implementation and maintenance operations of three investment projects involving active forest restoration was performed; and these differed according to the containers used to produce native forest seedlings produced in polyethylene bags, polyethylene tubes and degradable Ellepot (R). The values of the times of work elements measured for the implementation and maintenance operations were named as input estimates of mathematical models, after adjustment of probability distributions to continuous sample data sets. Through the Monte Carlo method simulation, value ranges were estimated for work elements and for the effective productivity of operations. The results showed that seedlings produced in different containers influenced the effective productivity of active restoration operations; and of these the highest effective productivity of planting operation occurred in the project with seedlings produced in Ellepot (R). In post-planting maintenance, the highest effective productivity occurred in the project with seedlings produced in polyethylene bags.

TI  - ATLANTIC FOREST REGENERATION IN ABANDONED PLANTATIONS OF EUCALYPT (Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) KDHill and LASJohnson) IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the floristic and phytosociological structure of the native tree community of the Atlantic Forest in five plantations of eucalypt (Corymbia citriodora) abandoned since 1996 in the Uniao Biological Reserve, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Eleven years after abandonment, plots of 20x10m were established totaling 0.1ha, in five different stands. A total of 219 individuals with DBH >= 5cm were sampled and distributed in 18 families and 36 species. The most important species were Xylopia sericea, Eugenia supraaxillaris, Cupania oblongifolia and Annona dolabripetala. Fabaceae was the richest family in species, followed by Myrtaceae and Bignoniaceae. Annonaceae was the family that had the greatest number of individuals, followed by Myrtaceae and Sapindaceae. The density and basal area per ha, by stands, ranged from 0 to 1010 individuals and 0 to 9.9m(2).ha(-1), respectively. Species richness ranged from 0 (stand 4) to 22 (stand 2). The results indicate a low natural regeneration in the understory of the eucalypt stands 11 years after abandonment. The possible inhibitory role of Corymbia citriodora in the establishment and growth of native tree species is discussed.

TI  - Alluring restoration strategies to attract seed-dispersing animals need more rigorous testing
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a recently published paper, Silva et al. conclude that placing fruit feeders (induced seed dispersal) in restored tropical forests serves to enrich the diversity of animal species and seeds in recovering forests and therefore is a cost-effective tropical forest restoration strategy. We argue that due to poor experimental design and choice of response variables measured, the data presented do not provide rigorous support that induced seed dispersal enhances tropical forest recovery. The authors present data on animal visitation to two fruit feeders in a single 7-year old restoration site in the Brazilian Atlantic forest over a 2-year period. Their study has no replication and lacks no-intervention controls with which to compare the effect of this restoration strategy. These experimental design shortcomings prevent them from demonstrating the efficacy of fruit feeders for attracting animals or enriching vegetation recovery. Like many faunal attraction studies, Silva et al. (2020) do not present any data on seedling recruitment; such data are needed to demonstrate that restoration strategies enhance vegetation recovery. Nor do they provide cost estimates for induced seed dispersal as compared to other empirically supported restoration strategies. Synthesis and applications. Promoting enticing restoration methods to attract animals into a restoration site without rigorous data to support the value added of such strategies for enhancing faunal abundance and forest vegetation recruitment has the potential to misguide the investments of scarce restoration resources. We recommend standards for evaluating novel restoration methods to determine whether they are cost-effective approaches to include in the diverse toolbox needed to meet ambitious global forest restoration targets.

TI  - Spread and impact of introduced conifers in South America: Lessons from other southern hemisphere regions
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of conifers introduced earlier elsewhere in the southern hemisphere suggests that recent invasions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are likely to increase in number and size. In South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, early ornamental introductions and small forestry plantations did not lead to large-scale invasions, while subsequent large plantations were followed with a lag of about 20-30 years by troublesome invasions. Large-scale conifer plantation forestry in South America began about 50-80 years later than in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while reports of invasions in South America lagged behind those in the latter nations by a century. Impacts of invading non-native conifers outside South America are varied and include replacement of grassland and shrubland by conifer forest, alteration of fire and hydrological regimes, modification of soil nutrients, and changes in aboveground and belowground biotic communities. Several of these effects have already been detected in various parts of South America undergoing conifer invasion. The sheer amount of area planted in conifers is already very large in Chile and growing rapidly in Argentina and Brazil. This mass of reproductive trees, in turn, produces an enormous propagule pressure that may accelerate ongoing invasions and spark new ones at an increasing rate. Regulations to control conifer invasions, including measures to mitigate spread, were belatedly implemented in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as in certain Australian states, inspired by observations on invasions in those nations. Regulations in South America are weaker and piecemeal, but the existing research base on conifer invasions elsewhere could be useful in fashioning effective regulations in South America. Pressure from foreign customers in South Africa has led most companies there to seek certification through the Forestry Stewardship Council; a similar programme operates in Australia. Such an approach may be promising in South America.

TI  - Three prescribed fire regimes on the restoration of flooded savannah grasslands under encroachment of Vochysia divergens Pohl, Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of woody plant species over grassland areas has been reported in different regions of the planet. This phenomenon has caused economic, social and environmental effects in the Brazilian Pantanal. Traditional knowledge based on scientific evidences technically supports the forms of management to control the process of colonization of woody plants in native grasslands, thus promoting the original ecological restoration of these ecosystems. Our study aimed to evaluate three management regimes with prescribed fire for controlling the invasion of Vochysia divergens Pohl. on grassland matrix areas in the Brazilian Pantanal. The results obtained showed that prescribed fire is an efficient tool in controlling V. divergens in the early stages of its establishment, and effectively contributes to ecological restoration processes in the savannah grasslands, aimed at controlling woody tree and shrub species invasions in the grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal.

TI  - Intelligent Tinkering in Ecological Restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration practitioners adopt a multiplicity of approaches that range from basic trial and error, and site-specific efforts, to complex experimental designs that test cutting edge theoretical hypotheses. We classify these different strategies to understand how restoration is planned and executed, and to contribute to the discussion on certification and evaluation. We use Aldo Leopold's notion of intelligent tinkering as a basis for a typology of four different approaches to restoration based on four parameters: motivation, general strategy, method of inquiry, and temporal and spatial scales of the expected outcomes. We argue that efforts to restore a damaged ecosystem in a skilled and experimental manner should be called professional intelligent tinkering versus amateur intelligent tinkering, and careless tinkering. We compare these three types of tinkering, and a more formal scientific approach. In professional intelligent tinkering, interventions and adjustments are done in a logical and careful manner, and with a methodical, experimental mindset. In contrast to the scientific approach, intelligent tinkering does not necessarily follow a formal experimental procedure, with replications and controls that allow extrapolation, nor is it driven by the motivation to publish in peer-reviewed journals. Rather, it is primarily driven by a desire to solve site-specific problems even in the absence of sufficient ecological knowledge to apply previously tested knowledge and techniques. We illustrate three approaches with three on-going restoration projects in southeastern Brazil, two of which are small scale, and one of which is very large scale.

TI  - Impact of land tenure on deforestation control and forest restoration in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines how land tenure constrains Brazil's ability to meet its deforestation control and forest restoration goals in its Amazonia biome. Our findings are based on an updated assessment of land tenure and land use in the region. Between 2019 and 2021, 44% of deforestation in Amazonia occurred in private lands, while forest removal in settlements ranged from 31% to 27% of the total. Deforestation in undesignated public lands increased from 11% in 2008 to 18% in 2021. Deforestation is highly concentrated, with 1% of properties accounting for 82.5% of forest cuts in 2021. In Amazonia, there is considerable non-compliance with the legal reserve provisions set by Brazil's Forest Code. Legal reserve deficits in private lands sum up to 18.17 Mha (million hectares), compared with 12.49 Mha of legal reserve surpluses. Even if all forest surpluses are offered in the forest credits market set in the Forest Code, farmers still need to restore 5.67 Mha to comply with the law. Large-scale cattle ranchers have a legal reserve deficit of 10.35 Mha (34% of their area). Most crop farming occurs in medium and large properties (4.63 Mha) with a large proportion of legal reserve deficits (45%). Given the political power and financial resources of large ranchers and crop producers, Brazil faces major challenges in inducing these farmers to meet their legal obligations. Therefore, Brazil needs to combine robust command-and-control strategies with market-based policies to achieve its deforestation and forest restoration goals. The government should tailor forest protection and restoration policies to the needs of different landowners, considering their land use practices, technical capacity, and financial resources.

TI  - Assessing phylogenetic diversity metrics in terrestrial ecological restoration: global trends and gaps
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Phylogenetic diversity (PD) metrics estimate community diversity through evolutionary relationships, yet their potential in restoration ecology remains underutilized. This study reviews the literature on ecological restoration of terrestrial vegetation to evaluate the use of PD metrics, focusing on their application, global trends, and existing research gaps. Most studies were conducted in the United States, China, and Brazil, primarily in temperate broadleaf mixed forests (36.36%) and tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (33.33%). Half of the papers were based on observational studies of restorations, and the other half were experimental studies. Plant PD was the primary focus in 90.09% of papers, with grasses and trees being the most studied life forms. Standardized effect size of the mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxonomic distance metrics were the most commonly used metrics. The majority of studies used PD as a response variable and restoration indicators (e.g. age, initial seed/seedling mixture, and restoration impact) as explanatory variables. Research bias toward grassland and limited studies in Africa and Oceania were noted. Future studies should broaden geographic coverage in restoration to provide a more comprehensive understanding of PD dynamics globally. Also, efforts should be made to expand the taxonomic scope beyond to capture the full spectrum of biodiversity in restoration assessments.

TI  - Integrated assessment of carbon dioxide removal portfolios: land, energy, and economic trade-offs for climate policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C goals. However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics-including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach-BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering-or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 degrees C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices.

TI  - REDD plus and Green Growth: synergies or discord in Vietnam and Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Green Growth (GG) has emerged as a global narrative, replacing to some extent and integrating earlier sustainable development narratives, while Reducing Emissions through avoiding Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has developed as major item in climate change negotiations. GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation.

TI  - THE SOIL SEED BANKAS AN INDICATOR OF ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT IN A MONTANE TROPICAL FOREST
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was conducted in a portion of tropical montane forest in the Caparao National Park, Brazil. The aim of this work was to assess the changes in seed bank composition, density and richness along an altitudinal gradient and across seasons, and to analyse the floristic links between the forest soil seed bank, seed rain, regeneration layer and adult tree layer. The seed bank data were collected in the dry and rainy seasons at seven different elevations, ranging from 1112 - 1550 m above sea level. The floristic relationships were analysed through the species lists derived from previous studies at these same locations. The results showed seed density and species richness varied among different elevations, but did not vary with gradient. Seed bank density and richness varied significantly across seasons, with the highest averages found in the rainy season. In the floristic composition, the higher elevations showed more similar composition than to the lower elevations. Seed bank composition was floristically different from the seed rain, the regeneration layer and the adult tree layer of the forest. Our results showed that the soil seed bank was influenced by both altitude and environmental seasonality. The findings highlighted the importance soil seed bank as a mechanism of post-disturbance forest regeneration.

TI  - Native species seedling growth in the ecological restoration of riparian forest
T2  - Neotropical Biology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the process of ecological restoration by monitoring the height of seedlings of native species in the Cerrado and the factors that affect their growth in riparian forest restoration. The growth pattern of the species were calculated with the average heights, generating linear regression models tested with ANOVA and compared by the likelihood test. The average of the frequencies of leaf herbivory, stem herbivory and absence of sheets (predation, dehydration and malnutrition) was analyzed by cluster analysis (Ward method) as possible factors that influence the growth. The average growth of 13 species was 50.39 cm. year(-1), ranging from 15.5 cm. year(-1) to 100.1 cm. year(-1). Of the thirteen species, eight had growth above 40 cm. year(-1), with potential to recover degraded areas. Five species showed significant differences in the linear equations of growth: Calophyllum brasiliense, Croton urucurana, Inga laurina, Myrsine guianensis and Tibouchina stenocarpa. Possible interactions with growth factors (leaf herbivory, stem herbivory and no leaves) resulted in the formation of two groups of species. Among the factors evaluated, overall, the species of both groups had higher leaf herbivory. The leaf herbivores and the absence of leaves affected the two groups differently, which may indicate susceptibility of different species from herbivores. The evaluation of the factors that interfere with growth after planting seedlings can help in adaptive management of areas in restoration process.

TI  - Multi-Scalar Governance for Restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: A Case Study on Small Landholdings in Protected Areas of Sustainable Development
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of forest restoration projects requires cross-scale and hybrid forms of governance involving the state, the market, civil society, individuals, communities, and other actors. Using a case study from the Atlantic Forest Hotspot, we examine the governance of a large-scale forest restoration project implemented by an international non-governmental organization (NGO) on family farmer landholdings located within protected areas of sustainable development. In addition to forest restoration, the project aims to provide an economic benefit to participating farmers by including native species with market potential (fruits, timber) in restoration models and by contracting farmers in the planting phase. We employed qualitative methods such as structured interviews and participant observation to assess the effect of environmental policy and multi-scalar governance on implementation and acceptability of the project by farmers. We demonstrate that NGO and farmer expectations for the project were initially misaligned, hampering farmer participation. Furthermore, current policy complicated implementation and still poses barriers to project success, and projects must remain adaptable to changing legal landscapes. We recommend increased incorporation of social science methods in earlier stages of projects, as well as throughout the course of implementation, in order to better assess the needs and perspectives of participants, as well as to minimize trade-offs.

TI  - An overview of forest loss and restoration in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest restoration is a strategy to reverse forest loss and degradation. We overviewed deforestation in the period 1975-2018 in the Brazilian Amazon and the projects, techniques, and scientific publications conducted to recover forest in the area by 2019. We used GIS to assess forest loss and a systematic data collection gathered from 12 universities, five major environmental agencies, and an ad-hoc bibliographic survey that rendered information from 405 restoration projects and 152 published studies. The Brazilian Amazon has undergone an accelerated deforestation in the last 43 years, resulting in 20% (788,353 km(2)) of its territory deforested by 2018. Deforestation rate was 27,033 km(2) yr(-1) between 1975 and 1987 and 14,542 km(2) yr(-1) between 1988 and 2018 (1.97% yr(-1) of forest loss between 1975 and 2018). In 2018, 41 Amazonian municipalities were classified as priority areas for monitoring and control deforestation and 21 additional municipalities were deemed as areas with controlled deforestation. Our survey identified 405 projects of forest restoration in 191 municipalities between 1950 and 2017. The majority (229) of these projects used seedling planting as the main forest restoration technique. Forest restoration projects based upon agroforestry systems (144), assisted natural regeneration (27), and natural regeneration (5) were also identified. Despite a considerable number of projects and publications, the region still lacks scientific studies that reinforce the choice of best practices for forest restoration, and the information currently available is not enough to quantify what has already been recovered or the potential area to be restored.

TI  - Structure and floristics of an old secondary rain forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and a comparison with adjacent primary forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of tropical secondary forests, and of the time taken for them to revert to 'primary' forest, is of increasing importance given the current global destruction of tropical rain forests. We describe a 55-year-old secondary rain forest at Barito Ulu, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and compare it with the adjacent, undisturbed, primary forest. Three 0.25 ha plots were set up in each forest type and all stems over 10 cm dbh were measured and identified, soil samples were taken and analysed, and the composition of the seed bank was examined. Although the basal area, tree height and biomass of the old secondary forest approached that of the primary forest (82% for basal area, 88% for tree height and 74% for biomass), there were still major differences in the floristics and species diversity. The old secondary forest was dominated by Cratoxylon arborescens (Hypericaceae) and Pternandra caerulescens (Melastomataceae), whereas the primary forest was dominated by dipterocarps. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was 3.40 for the old secondary forest plots and 4.17 for the primary forest plots; the Jaccard's coefficient of similarity was 24%. Mortality, recruitment, turnover and tree growth rates were greater in the old secondary forest. The seed bank of the old secondary forest contained more than double the number of seeds of the primary forest seed bank and many more seeds were of shrub species; there were the same number of species in the two forests seed banks. There were no major differences between the two forest types in terms of soil chemistry. Despite the close proximity to potential seed sources. succession in the Barito Ulu area has proceeded more slowly than in some other tropical areas. This may be due to the low concentrations of soil nutrients and/or the poor dispersal of dipterocarp seeds. Fifty-five years of succession is concluded to be insufficient time for the return of most primary forest species. However, the forest structure of the old secondary forest shows a closer resemblance to the primary forest than does the floristic composition. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest Restoration in the State of Rio De Janeiro: Adherence to Legislation
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated forest restoration projects filed at the state environmental agency of Rio de Janeiro (Inca), regarding the requirements contained in the Resolution No 36/2011. Legal, technical, environmental and ecological parameters of 65 restoration projects in the design and implementation phases were analyzed. Only 29% of the projects met the requirements of Resolution No 36/2011. The low compliance with the requirements of the resolution evidences the lack of knowledge of the current regulations in the state of Rio de Janeiro by the technical users of the system. This condition implies a longer time of environmental licensing. Recently, Inea has revoked Res. No 36/2011 through Res. No 143/2017, which, in addition to simplifying the presentation of restoration projects, gave rise to the State System for Monitoring and Evaluation of Forest Restoration - SEMAR.

TI  - Effects of howler monkey reintroduction on ecological interactions and processes
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rewilding has been an increasingly popular tool to restore plant-animal interactions and ecological processes impaired by defaunation. However, the reestablishment of such processes has seldom been assessed. We investigated the restoration of ecological interactions following the reintroduction of the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) to a defaunated Atlantic forest site. We expected the reintroduction to restore plant-animal interactions and interactions between howlers and dung beetles, which promote secondary seed dispersal. We estimated the number of interactions expected to be restored by the reintroduction to provide the baseline interaction richness that could be restored. We followed the reintroduced howler monkeys twice a week for 24 months (337 hours total) to assess their diet. We used howler monkey dung in secondary seed dispersal experiments with 2484 seed mimics to estimate the removal rates by dung beetles and collected the beetles to assess community attributes. We compared the potential future contribution of howler monkeys and other frugivores to seed dispersal based on the seed sizes they disperse in other areas where they occur. In 2 years, howler monkeys consumed 60 animal-dispersed plant species out of the 330 estimated. Twenty-one dung beetle species were attracted to experimentally provided dung; most of them were tunnelers, nocturnal, and large-sized (>10 mm). On average 30% (range 0-100%) of the large seed mimics (14 mm) were moved by dung beetles. About 91% of the species consumed by howlers (size range 0.3-34.3 mm) overlapped in seed size with those removed by dung beetles. In our study area, howler monkeys may consume more large-seeded fruit species than most other frugivores, highlighting their potential to affect forest regeneration. Our results show reintroductions may effectively restore ecological links and enhance ecological processes.

TI  - A comprehensive experimental assessment of glyphosate ecological impacts in riparian forest restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Competition with invasive grasses is one of the most important drivers of tree planting failures, especially in tropical forests. A widely disseminated weeding approach has been glyphosate spraying, the most used herbicide globally in forestry and ecosystem restoration. However, glyphosate use in restoration is highly controversial and requires further studies to elucidate its effects on restoration processes and the environment. We evaluated the use of glyphosate in riparian forest restoration and its impacts on tree planting costs, weed control efficiency, planted seedling performance, herbaceous and woody species regeneration, soil bacteria, and environmental contamination, using mowing treatments as a reference and based on a controlled experiment established in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Glyphosate spraying reduced by one-half and one-third the accumulated aboveground biomass of, respectively, weeds in general and of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens compared to mowing treatments, and it reduced the cost by half. The performance of planted tree seedlings was markedly favored by glyphosate spraying compared to mowing treatments, as expressed by improved seedling height (similar to twice higher), crown area (similar to 5x higher), and basal area (similar to 5x higher); the regeneration of both native woody and ruderal herbaceous plants were also enhanced. Neither glyphosate nor its metabolite Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) residues were detected in either water runoff or soil samples, but they were found at relatively high concentrations in the runoff sediments (from 1.32 to 24.75 mg/kg for glyphosate and from 1.75 to 76.13 mg/kg for AMPA). Soil bacteria communities differed before and after glyphosate spraying in comparison to mowing plots (without glyphosate). Glyphosate spraying was far more cost effective than mowing for controlling U. decumbens and greatly improved the performance of planted tree seedlings and natural regeneration, while not leaving residues in soil and water. However, the changes in the structure of bacterial communities and high concentration of glyphosate and AMPA residues in runoff sediments highlight the need for caution when using this herbicide in riparian buffers. We present alternatives for reducing glyphosate use and minimizing its risks in tree planting initiatives.

TI  - Forest restoration in old pasture areas dominated by Urochloa brizantha
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study it was evaluated the density of recruits in an area previously occupied by Urochloa brizantha pasture undergoing forest restoration and in a Semideciduous Forest. Was evaluated the effect of the available light on the biomass of the exotic grass, and investigated associations of recruit density with soil variables and understory light availability. The seed rain in both areas was also evaluated. The biomass of U. brizantha was positively associated with available light and, a negative association was found between recruit density and available light when considering the two areas together. A negative associatio between recruit density and soil pH was found. The results suggest that the low soil fertility did not limited recruitment in the semideciduos forest. The results showed that high resource availability favors the competitivity of U. brizantha, impairing the forest restoration in area previously used as pastures. So, pratices that result in decreasing in light availability would favors the forest restoration in areas previously used as pasture.

TI  - The diversity of termites along the altitudinal gradient in a Karst Area of Southern Gombong, Central Java, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - A karst area of Southern Gombong at altitudes of 0500 m has a porous substrate whose soil content decreases as the altitude gets higher toward the top of the hill. This area is characterized by poor soil nutrient, but it has high CaCO3 and pH, which is not a favorable habitat for many species of termites which depend on soil substrate, as source of nutrient for community development, especially soil-feeding termites, as habitat for fungi as secondary daily diet, and as a stabilizer of the nest humidity. The aims of this research were to determine the diversity of termites along the altitudinal gradient in this karst area, and to determine the correlation between altitude and the termite diversity. The area was divided into 5 segments based on the altitudes, i.e., 0-100 m, 100-200 m, 200-300 m, 300-400 in, and 400-500 m. In each segment, a transect belt, 100 m long and 2 m wide, was made. Each transect was divided into 20 sections. Termites were sampled from living trees, branches, bark, litter and soil for 30 minutes per person in each section. The data were analyzed to determine the Shannon-Wienner diversity index (H'), Shannon-Evenness index (E), and Simpson's Dominance index, and to find the correlation between the species diversity and altitude. The results showed that the termite diversity in the study site was low. Only four termite species were found with the indexes of diversity (H'), evenness (E), and dominance (D) of 1.01, 0.73 and 0.44 respectively. There was no linear correlation between termite diversity and altitude; the highest diversity was found in the middle altitudes, following the mid-domain effect model.

TI  - Nest density of Atta sexdens (Linnaeus, 1758) in Atlantic Forest restoration sites depends on the surrounding landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbivory is an important ecological filter, affecting plant establishment in restoration sites. One group of herbivores whose abundance has been increasing with environmental changes are the leaf-cutting ants (LCA). Here we evaluated the influence of the surrounding landscape on Atta sexdens nest density in restoration sites, by testing the hypothesis that sites farthest from forest fragments or with less surrounding habitat cover have higher nest density. The study was conducted in eleven reforestations with native species, amidst an agricultural matrix in southern Brazil. For each site, we estimated LCA nest density (active, inactive and total) and landscape metrics (distance to nearest forest fragment, surrounding habitat area and an index combining both distance and surrounding habitat area, the Proximity Index). There were negative relationships between active and total nest density and surrounding habitat area. These results suggest that increased isolation from forest fragments is a factor contributing to the relaxation of top-down control. Therefore, the increase in A. sexdens population density in restoration sites is a result, at least in part, of low pressure from natural enemies, since LCA are not limited by resource availability.

TI  - Nutritional deficiency in young plants of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recovery and forest restoration of degraded ecosystems may not occur as desired if there is a nutritional deficiency or an inadequate supply of nutrients in the initial phase of development of native forest species. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency effects on young plants of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, a Brazilian native species. For that, purpose the nutritional deficiency was induced. The nutrient contents were determined in the leaves and stems, to evaluated the effect of the nutritional deficiency on height, production of dry natter and in the carbon stock of the stem of young plants of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi. The experiment was carried on in the greenhouse using a randomized block design with three replications and thirteen treatments, using the technique of diagnosis by subtraction (-N, -P, -K, -Ca, -Mg, -S, -B, -Cu, -Fe, -Mn, -Mo, -Zn). In the complete treatment the species was grown in a nutrient solution with all macro and micronutrients. Deficiency symptoms were observed and the effect of nutritional deficiency on dry matter weight of young plants of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi were evaluated. These results clearly indicated that forest establishment or recovery and restoration of damaged ecosystems by planting Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi. in soils that require nutritional supplementation may have its success compromised if there is no nutritional supplementation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of native forest species using different forest restoration methods and under different maintenance techniques, in a Tableland Forest. The experiment was installed in August 2007 in 'Reserva Natural Vale (RNV), Linhares, ES, in a randomized blocks that consisted of 4 treatments and 3 replications: T1 (control) ants control; T2 selective chemical weeding, ants control and control of herbicide tolerant species; T3 same as T2 + planting of 14 pioneer species of the Atlantic Rainforest (spacing: 5 x 5 m) and intercalated seeding of Sesbania grandiflora in pits; and T4 same as T2 + planting of 54 species of the Atlantic Rainforest (3 x 3 m). Plants with DBH >= 5 cm were measured and identified at the time of the installation of the experiment and the three subsequent years. In the third year the IAF was also collected. The richest families in species in the third year of study were Fabaceae, Anacardiaceae and Lecythidaceae, and only in T4 species were observed in the four ecological groups. The higher leaf area index was observed in T3, indicating greater shading area. The ingrowth of plants and basal area was higher in T3 and T4, suggesting greater vegetation growth, where seedlings were planted. In general, the elimination of weed competition worked positively in the tree growth.

TI  - Titled Amazon Indigenous Communities Cut Forest Carbon Emissions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous communities (ICs) have emerged as important players in global efforts to reduce forest carbon emissions, in part because they are viewed as conscientious stewards of the forest lands to which they have legal title. Yet ICs tend to be located in remote areas where deforestation would be limited regardless of who manages them. Therefore, to determine whether IC management actually cuts forest carbon emissions, it is important to control for such confounding factors. To that end, we use propensity score matching and regression to analyze the effects on 2001-2013 deforestation and forest carbon emissions of IC management in the Amazon regions of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia. We find that IC management reduces both deforestation and forest carbon emissions in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. We are not able to discern a statistically significant effect in Ecuador. These findings suggest that IC management can, in fact, help combat climate change.

T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations, especially eucalyptus, increase wood supply, avoid deforestation of native plants, and preserve local biodiversity. Defoliating caterpillars often reduce the productivity of these plantations. Rearing and releasing pentatomid predators is a strategy to manage these pests biologically. In this study, the predators Brontocoris tabidus (Signoret) and Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) (both Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) were evaluated in a clonal eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla Blake x Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden) (both Myrtaceae) plantation. Brontocoris tabidus dispersed further than P. nigrispinus over the 7-d trial. Males of both species dispersed more than females, and most P. nigrispinus were found within 10 m from the release point, whereas the majority of B. tabidus were observed between 15 and 30 m from their initial position of release.

TI  - The stress gradient hypothesis explains plant-plant interaction networks in edapho climatic gradients
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts a shift from facilitation to competition as the environment turns from severe to favorable. Different authors have reported conflicting results when testing the SGH, mainly concerning the role of facilitation in stressful environments. We aimed to infer the mechanisms best explaining the variation of interspecific interactions across gradients through the joint analysis of network metrics and abiotic variables. We analyzed six plant-plant interaction networks (size, number of links, connectance, average degree, nestedness, and modularity) in edapho-climatic gradients in northeastern Brazil. Nestedness occurs when many species connect both with each other and with a set of other species with few connections, indicating facilitation. Modularity occurs when the network is split into groups of species linking to each other only within the groups, indicating competition. We used correlation, multiple linear regressions, and a generalized linear model to understand how the abiotic variables could drive network alterations and if the abundance of a possible benefactor species (Fabaceae trees) could increase facilitation. All the climate, soil, and network variables varied widely across the sites. All the sites had aluminium-toxic, nutrient-poor and nitrogen-limited soils, and Hol-dridge's life zones varied from very dry to moist tropical forests. Climate, soil, and network variables were correlated to each other, but the soil was the main driver of variation in the network metrics. Nestedness and modularity were negatively correlated, and both were correlated with the number of Fabaceae trees in each community. Deciduous species in very dry and dry forests require more nitrogen than evergreen species in dry/ moist and moist forests, so the soil was more limiting to the deciduous species, which associated with Fabaceae trees and increased network nestedness. Our data corroborated the SGH, which, in this case, was mediated by the soil nutrient status and had Fabaceae as the benefactor species.

TI  - Balancing carrots and sticks in REDD plus : implications for social safeguards
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop nationallevel safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests.

TI  - Habitat structure and food resources for wildlife across successional stages in a tropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - Mesoscale gradients of herb richness and abundance in central Amazonia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - There are few hypotheses to explain local understory diversity patterns. There is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales, but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally. Here, I examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale (64 km(2)) in a wet tropical forest, and possible factors causing them. Herb richness, diversity, density, and cover were measured in fifty-nine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over Reserva Ducke, Manaus. Herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients. Whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope, Marantaceae density and cover decreased. Density of sedges increased with altitude, but did not vary with slope. Density and cover of Marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content. Pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas Marantaceae richness decreased, richness of both groups increased with cation content. Diversity increased with altitude for Marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes. Some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs, such as the greater abundance of Marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots, where water availability is higher and probably also light, and the greater richness of Marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots. The unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes, instead of in bottomlands, suggest that biotic or litter-mediated controls may be important to set these patterns.

TI  - Individual Biomass and Carbon Equations for Mimosa scabrella Benth. (Bracatinga) in Southern Brazil
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mimosa scabrella Benth. is an important native species of southern Brazil widely used for energy and promising for reforestation carbon offsets. Quantification of biomass and carbon stock is valuable for both purposes. From a forest inventory conducted in southern Brazil, data of M. scabrella were analyzed. Thirty sample trees were felled, excavated and weighed in the field and brought to laboratory for biomass and carbon determination. The total aboveground biomass represented 85% of the tree biomass, while roots corresponded to 15%. Correlation matrix of diameter at 1.3 m height (D), tree height (H) versus total and compartment biomass (P) indicated strong association between tree dimensions and biomasses. Five regression models were tested and equations were fitted to data of five biomass compartments and total tree biomass. The best fitting model for total biomass was P = -0.49361 + 0.034865 x (DH)-H-2 whereas for the partial biomass of the compartments was InP = beta(0) + beta(1) x In(D) + beta(2) InH. Carbon concentration was statistically significantly different in foliage than in other compartments. Three approaches of calculating carbon stocks were evaluated and compared to actual data:) Estimated total biomass x weighted mean carbon concentration; 2) Estimated partial (compartment) biomass x compartment average carbon concentration; and 3) Carbon regression equations. No statistical difference was detected among them. It was concluded that biomass equations fitted in this study were accurate and useful for fuelwood and carbon estimations.

TI  - Survival, seedlings growth and natural regeneration in areas under ecological restoration in a sandy coastal plain (restinga) of southeastern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restinga is an ecosystem associated mainly with the Atlantic Forest that can be defined as vegetation of the coastal plain established on sandy soil. This study was carried out in degraded areas of restinga in a Conservation Unit in Sao Joao da Barra, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 2012, a restoration project was initiated in the area, with implementation of plantings in hexagonal rings and artificial perches. Seedlings were planted in two contrasting situations: sandbanks (dry areas) and depression zones (areas prone to seasonal flooding). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of seedlings planted in both areas and accompany natural regeneration. We hypothesised that species planted and recruited in depressions should have better survival rates and increments in height (H) and diameter at the ground level (DGL) than the ones planted in sandbanks. Monitoring of planted seedlings was carried out in November 2016. Both communities had similar mortality (c. 50%). Greater increments in H were found for Inga laurina and Schinus terebinthifolia in depressions. Higher increments in DGL were observed especially for I. laurina, Inga vera and S. terebinthifolia with good performance in both areas. In general, seedlings planted in depressions showed greater performances, which can be related to higher water and nutrient availability. The most abundant natural regenerant species were Scoparia dulcis in sandbanks and S. terebinthifolia in depressions. A high number of regenerants was found associated with artificial perches, especially Cynophalla flexuosa, which demonstrates that the technique facilitated regeneration in the area.

TI  - Economic Impacts of Payments for Environmental Services on Livelihoods of Agro-extractivist Communities in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural communities in the Brazilian Amazon rely on manioc, produced in a swidden-fallow system that uses land cleared from forest areas. Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants.

TI  - Mating System and Effective Population Size of the Overexploited Neotropical Tree (Myroxylon peruiferum L.f.) and Their Impact on Seedling Production
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reproductive system of a tree species has substantial impact on genetic diversity and structure within and among natural populations. Such information, should be considered when planning tree planting for forest restoration. Here, we describe the mating system and genetic diversity of an overexploited Neotropical tree, Myroxylon peruiferum L.f. (Fabaceae) sampled from a forest remnant (10 seed trees and 200 seeds) and assess whether the effective population size of nursery-grown seedlings (148 seedlings) is sufficient to prevent inbreeding depression in reintroduced populations. Genetic analyses were performed based on 8 microsatellite loci. M. peruiferum presented a mixed mating system with evidence of biparental inbreeding (100) population conservation. Therefore, to obtain a reasonable genetic representation of native tree species and prevent problems associated with inbreeding depression, seedling production for restoration purposes may require a much larger sampling effort than is currently used, a problem that is further complicated by species with a mixed mating system. This study emphasizes the need to integrate species reproductive biology into seedling production programs and connect conservation genetics with ecological restoration.

TI  - Morphometric indices in the Curu?-Una River sub-basin as potential indicators for forest restoration in hydrographic mesoregions in the Central Amazon
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds are planning units because they are delimited by topographic divisions formed by a main river and its tributaries, in which water drainage is channeled into a course of greater water volume, such as the Amazon basin, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The objective of this work was to analyze the morphometry of the hydrographic sub-basin of the Curua-Una River (SBHRM), that integrates the Curua-Una hydrographic micro-region in western Para, Brazil, and its surroundings. Data from abiotic variables integrated in a geographic information system were used to identify the areas that most need restauration using production systems such as agroforestry as part of a forest restoration process, necessary to land degradation in the sub-basin and its surroundings. It was found that the sub-basin of the Curua-Una River has a more elongated shape, confirmed by the circularity index, compactness coefficient, and shape factor. It is a fifth order sub-basin with a densely branched drainage network with a low probability of flooding due to the predominance of undulating relief. The morphometric characteristics present conditions that can be used in anthropic areas integrated into production systems such as agroforestry. The existence of tree species such as andiroba, copaiba, and the Brazil nut tree in the Tapajos basin, as inventoried by the Project RADAMBRAZIL, must be included in agroforestry arrangements in the recovery of degraded areas in western Para.

TI  - Restoration potential of eight tree species from a seasonally dry tropical forest in southeast Piaui, Brazil
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The conservation and restoration of forest landscapes is an important aspect of sustainable development. In semi-arid regions these practices are difficulted by the harsh climate of these environments, with low precipitation values and prolonged dry seasons. The objective of this study is to identify tree species from the south of the Brazilian state of Piaui that have potential to be used in forest restoration programs.Results: Data from forest inventory and tree characteristics were used to select eight tree species using target species definition, focusing on species with desirable wood properties, abundance in the study region, favorable dendrometric variables, seed availability, ease of seed germination and seedling growth in nursery and field conditions, among others. These species were then evaluated as candidates for restoration using a framework species approach focusing on the following attributes: (i) 70% or higher seedling survival in the field; (ii) seedling height of 45 cm or taller after the first growing season in the field and (iii) 70% or greater nursery seedling survival.Conclusion: The species Combretum glaucocarpum, Cenostigma macrophyllum, and Pityrocarpa moniliformis are suitable to be employed in forest restoration programs in the southern region of Piaui, Brazil. Further studies must be carried out to assess the behavior of these and other potential tree species in long term field conditions and under varying silvicultural regimes, a key aspect for forest restoration.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional diversity of applied nucleation for ecological restoration
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nucleation has been introduced as a promising method for ecological restoration and represents an efficient, as well as economical, alternative to existing methods of restoration to accelerate secondary succession in degraded sites. In this study, we evaluated ecological indicators of taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of planted trees and subsequent natural regeneration individuals to verify the success of restoration in three sites (Cacapava do Sul, Minas do Leao, and Pantano Grande) with applied nucleation carried out seven years ago in Rio Grande do Sul State, in south of Brazil. All shrub and tree regenerating or planted individuals with a height greater than 30 cm were counted, identified, and measured in 5 m x 5 m plots, totaling 575 m(2) evaluated in each site. The results show that richness of regenerating species was similar in each site, but the richness of planted species was lower in Minas do Leao, intermediate in Cacapava do Sul, and higher in Pantano Grande. We verify a difference in the floristic composition of planted and regenerating species. The functional diversity indices were similar between planted and regenerating, with the exception of functional dispersion, although Minas do Leao presents low functional richness (0.13). This indicates that even with lower species richness and lower functional richness in planting does not imply lower species richness and lower functional richness of regenerants. Applied nucleation can be an efficient method for ecological restoration and favors the micro-habitat alteration and the return of propagules, even with lower initial richness of planted species.

TI  - Priority areas for forest restoration aiming at the maintenance of water resources in a basin in the Cerrado/Amazon ecotone, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mato Grosso is one of the states with the greatest agricultural importance in Brazil and represents one of the main agricultural frontiers in the world. The expansion of these frontiers, along with deforestation, livestock farming and urbanization, leads to a new dynamics with significant environmental impacts on the availability of water resources. In this context, the objective of the study was to evaluate methods of multi-criteria analysis and map priority areas for forest restoration in the Upper Teles Pires basin - Mato Grosso, Brazil, in order to support decision makers and the maintenance of water resources, according to the quantity and quality of water. Multi-criteria Analysis (MCA), with integration of the criteria of proximity to forest, slope, erodibility and proximity to surface water, was used. The criteria maps were aggregated using the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), with varying risk and tradeoff, and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) methods. From the MCA it was possible to successfully identify potential areas for forest restoration for the basin under study. The WLC, OWA2 and OWA6 methods showed a good solution for decision-making as they respectively set 16.38%, 22.73% and 12.79% of the total area of the basin as of very high priority.

TI  - Maximizing biodiversity conservation and carbon stocking in restored tropical forests
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings is critical to support the global forest landscape restoration movement. We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8-10.6% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.

T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. The first step towards understanding the conservation situation and informing conservation decision-making is to identify the habitat loss drivers. However, for nearly all tropical biota, there is a glaring lack of information on the spatiotemporal patterns of anthropogenic drivers.2. Our objective was to analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of the main anthropogenic drivers of habitat loss for Bradypus torquatus and Bradypus crinitus, two endangered and endemic species to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.3. We used land-use information associated with seven major IUCN-based threats to sloths, covering a three-generation time window (1988-2020), to quantify the current area occupied, temporal changes, heterogeneity, and intensity of drivers across species distributions.4. We found that cattle farming and ranching dominate the range of both species (from 49% to 56%) and cover an area larger than the remaining native forest. Other drivers also represent important spatial and temporal features of land conversion across species distributions.5. Driven mainly by livestock expansion, both sloth species have experienced a significant loss of forest cover (Bradypus torquatus - 659098.70 ha; Bradypus crinitus - 139013.20 ha) in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Overall, Bradypus torquatus showed a higher rate of deforestation than forest regeneration, whereas forest gains outweighed habitat loss for Bradypus crinitus.6. Our results show that a substantial area of native forest - essential for strictly arboreal species - is being continuously replaced by cattle ranching and agricultural activities, which may lead to population isolation and decline, threatening the long-term population viability.

TI  - Optimized allocation of forest restoration zones to minimize soil losses in watersheds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increase of water erosion is one of the main problems in watersheds all over the world and directly affects soil and water resources, causing economic and environmental losses. We proposed a combination of Genetic Algorithm and Erosion/Deposition modelling to allocate vegetation zones in order to reduce soil losses within watersheds. In this study, we have used Unit Stream Power Based Erosion Deposition (USPED) model to predict the spatial distribution of erosion and sediment deposition. Based on USPED estimates, Genetic Algorithm optimize site as well size of forest restoration zones in order to reduce soil losses. Proposed approach considered watershed entirely, in a cell-level optimization, to find the best possible arrangement of forest zones. For initial scenario, soil loss estimate was 2.045,55 ton. ha(-1). year(-1) and after optimization we achieved 52% reduction. Optimized forest zones formed connected and compacted patches, which enable field implementation. Methodology is also applicable to other watersheds around world.

TI  - Seed Bank in Restored Bauxite Mine in Southeast Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to characterize the soil seed bank in a restored bauxite mine ten years after the restoration project. The study was conducted in a bauxite-exploited mine, which was restored with trees. We collected 40 samples of surface soil (0.25 x 0.30 x 0.05 m) to evaluate soil seed bank by germination method in shade house for six months. Results showed that 2,489 seedlings emerged, belonging to 69 species and 23 botanical families, with a density of 830 seedlings m(-2). Poaceae and Cannabaceae were the families with higher density. A larger number of species and individuals were pioneer and zoochoric species. The soil seed bank of the restored area showed no difference in plant density and floristic composition between the border and the core study area. There was no floristic similarity between planted species and the seed bank. Results showed that the seed bank was able to supply species and individuals upon germination.

TI  - Large-scale forest restoration generates comprehensive biodiversity gains in an Amazonian mining site
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To reconcile environmental issues with socioeconomic development, the mitigation hierarchy emerges as a pivotal strategy that sequentially addresses environmental impacts through a structured approach of avoidance, minimization, remediation, and offsetting. No net loss (NNL) is achieved when biodiversity gains from all four mitigation stages are larger than the project's environmental impacts. Here, we assessed biodiversity changes linked to the implementation of the S11D Eliezer Batista iron mining Complex in the Caraj ' as National Forest, Par ' a state, Brazil, expecting losses due to mining activities and gains through forest restoration offsets. We evaluated biodiversity stocks based on Biotic Value as the product of habitat importance and actual conditions. Habitat importance, a unique value for each class of land cover recognized within the study site, is based on the evaluation of habitat naturalness, rarity and endangerment, and substitutability. Actual conditions are computed from field-surveyed key ecological attributes of vegetation structure, community composition and diversity, and ecological processes, and forest restoration activities are able to restitute, within 4-6 years only, approximately 73 % of old-growth forest conditions. The Biotic Value ranges from 0 for mine lands to 1 for patchy savanna formations stocking above ironstone outcrops (locally known as cangas) and amounts to 0.43 units/ha for secondary forests. Between 2008 and 2021, we detected comprehensive land-use changes in the study area: Cangas, farmlands and old-growth forests decreased, while secondary forests and minelands increased considerably. Despite environmental degradation, the emergence of secondary forests contributed to a positive biodiversity balance within the areas managed by the mining company (+379 units), while biodiversity losses dominated outside the company's boundaries (-171 units). Although like-for-like compensation of canga impacts remains challenging, we thus conclude that forest restoration efforts initiated by the mining company effectively reversed the trajectory of environmental degradation prevailing in the landscape and provided considerable biodiversity gains for the region.

TI  - Response of vegetation to sheep dung addition in a degraded Cerrado area
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and is classified as a biodiversity hotspot. The establishment of hydroelectric power stations in Brazil originated degraded areas due to the removal of soil for construction of dams, in which native vegetation sometimes fails to reestablish due to the bad soil conditions. Sheep excrete most of the nutrients they ingest, such as phosphorus, calcium, potassium and nitrogen. This study aimed at investigating whether sheep dung contributes to the improvement of soil quality and stimulates the process of ecological succession in areas affected by the construction of the hydroelectric power station of Ilha Solteira. Four areas were selected, located at the Experimental Farm of Unesp Ilha Solteira/SP, and ten plots of 1 m(2) each were established. From October 2014 to December 2015, five replicates received 150 g fresh sheep dung every 15 days. In December 2015 soil sample from top 0.10 m was collected for the determination of soil attributes. Aboveground biomass was also collected, separated into four functional groups, oven-dried and weighed. Data were analysed to check the effect of dung addition upon soil and vegetation variables. Dung addition stimulated the development of several functional groups and changed soil nutrient concentrations in all four studied areas.

TI  - Forest restoration monitoring through digital processing of high resolution images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources.

TI  - Using leaf δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and photosynthetic parameters to understand acclimation to irradiance and leaf age effects during tropical forest regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerating forests are important for the maintenance of tropical biodiversity. Forest management in fragments of Atlantic forest in Brazil includes removal of exotic eucalyptus trees that were once part of plantations, in order to reestablish native flora. However, it is unclear how native tree saplings regenerating under former plantations respond to abrupt changes in environmental conditions associated, with exotic tree removal. We used leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) and photosynthetic parameters to evaluate physiological responses of native tree saplings to canopy opening. We analyzed young and mature leaves of the three most representative species of regenerating trees (Byrsonima sericea, Siparuna guianensis, Xylopia sericea) in one secondary forest fragment and three managed areas that form an irradiance gradient (9, 85, 230 and 550 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in Brazilian Atlantic forest. Eucalyptus removal increased photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance in mature leaves of all species, but there was no change in intercellular CO2 concentration. In young leaves, two species showed increasing A and one species showed increasing gs in response to canopy opening. Leaf delta C-13 did not vary significantly among species, but site and age affected delta C-13, as leaves from shaded sites showed lower delta C-13 values (around -33 parts per thousand) than leaves from lighter sites (around -30 parts per thousand), and young leaves showed higher delta C-13 values (around -30 parts per thousand) than mature leaves (around -32 parts per thousand). Mature leaves showed greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than young leaves. The sensitivity of young leaf delta C-13 to irradiance increases suggests that delta C-13 in these organs is controlled not only through carbon imported to new leaves during growth, but also through direct responses of stomatal control and carboxylation as these young leaves develop their photosynthetic competency. Young and mature leaves showed decreased total chlorophyll/carotenoids with increasing irradiance, indicating acclimation capacity from early developmental phases. Young leaves in high irradiance sites showed susceptibility to irradiance stress (F-v/F-m, around 0.7), but values for mature leaves did not show high irradiance stress (F-v/F-m around 0.8). In conclusion, forest management affected leaf delta C-13 of the main regenerating understary species, with site effects being more important than species-specific features for photosynthetic performance. The data also indicate that these species are resilient to forest management that includes exotic eucalyptus canopy tree removal. In this context, carbon stable isotopes can be considered as recorders of ecological change and can be used to study the effects of management on forest regeneration and photosynthetic competency.

TI  - Foxes and goats: the outcome of free-ranging livestock farming in Brazilian dry forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans are promoting drastic changes in biological communities that result in 'winner-loser' species replacements across multiple spatial scales. In tropical regions, such replacements can be particularly driven by deforestation, especially in landscapes devoted to free-ranging livestock production in which mixing native and exotic species can create species-poor and homogenized communities. We tested this hypothesis assessing medium- and large-bodied non-volant mammals in four 16-km(2) landscapes with varying deforestation levels (5%, 30%, 70%, and 95% forest cover), where exotic mammals (e.g., cows and goats) have free access to the remaining Caatinga dry forest. Using camera traps, we obtained 2808 independent records of 17 species, most of them (2054 records, 73%) corresponding to seven exotic species. Native Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox) and exotic Capra hircus (goat) accounted for almost half of the records and 60-80% of the records in the two most deforested landscapes. Alpha diversity did not differ significantly among landscapes, but the two more forested landscapes tended to have more native species than exotic ones. Beta diversity patterns among and within landscapes were relatively low regardless of species abundance, indicating biotic homogenization at multiple spatial scales. We conclude that a novel mammal community full of exotic mammals and a few generalist natives has been established in the study region. To promote environmental-friendly livestock farming in the largest tropical dry forest of South America, we should avoid deforestation, especially in sites that concentrate native species, segregate lands for livestock and conservation, and boost inspection against illegal hunting.

TI  - Facilitation and competition influence succession in a subtropical old field
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought.

TI  - Differences in mammal communities between forest fragments and restoration areas in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistence of larger mammals in fragmented forest landscapes depends not only on the protection of remaining habitats but also on ecological restoration sites. It is known that the landscape context is an important predictor of species persistence, abundance and distribution. Here we evaluate how landscape characteristics influence the recovery of larger mammals in ecological restoration sites. We assess the richness and composition of mammals in forest fragments and restoration sites using landscape metrics such as forest cover and connectivity. Forest fragments and restoration sites present the same richness (n = 26), but differ in species composition. Some seed-dispersing mammals were absent in restoration areas, such as Alouatta guariba (brown howler monkey) and Coendou spinosus (paraguayan hairy dwarf porcupine). The percentage of forest cover in the landscape was responsible for 29.09% of the variation in species composition between the evaluated forest formations, exerting a positive or negative influence depending on the species requirements. The results demonstrate the importance of considering not only landscape metrics in an ecological restoration plan, but also the historical landscape context, such as the fauna composition before the disturbance and how these species respond to environmental changes, thus improving the success of future ecological restoration measurements and policies.

TI  - Review of Ecological Restoration in the Brazilian Pampa.
T2  - Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is crucial to counter global ecosystem degradation. The Brazilian Pampa, home to significant biodiversity, has been overlooked in research and conservation policies. This study involved a comprehensive literature review of 26 articles on restoration in the Brazilian Pampa, including 17 on grasslands and nine on forests, to understand the currentstate of knowledge on the subject. In grassland areas, the primary challenges were the invasion of exotic species and the lack of native seed or plant material. For forest restoration, the main issue was the conversion of forested areas to pastures, with challenges including the limited availability of nurseries for native species seedlings. Despite recent increases in research and some promising results, effectively guiding restoration efforts requires more research across the ecosystems of the Pampa, stronger networks for seedling and seed production, and concrete actions to achieve national restoration policy goals. The Pampa's potential for sustainable grassland use offers a unique opportunity to promote biodiversity conservation alongside economic development, making restoration efforts especially attractive.

TI  - Evaluation and characterization of passive restoration of an Atlantic forest tree community with focus on the understory
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the potential of the passive restoration approach in recovering the original forest in a region particularly important for the conservation of the Atlantic forest biodiversity. This biome has been fragmented and reduced to only 11.7% of its original range and currently its conservation relies considerably on the spontaneous regeneration of native forests in abandoned agricultural lands, a widespread phenomenon referred to in this study as passive restoration. We compare the regeneration strata of a 25-year-old secondary forest (restoration site) and of a primary forest (reference site) based on tree and shrub data in order to evaluate and characterize passive restoration in the surroundings of the Iguacu National Park, in western Parana State, Brazil. We recorded 589 individuals from 43 species in the restoration site and 831 individuals from 48 species in the reference site. We found smaller values of density, diversity, proportions of individuals from zoochoric and non-pioneer species; and a distinct floristic composition at the restoration site. However, plant diameter, species richness and proportions of zoochoric and non-pioneer species did not differ between sites, suggesting an appropriate successional trajectory, and the potential for the application of the passive restoration approach in the region. We found a greater number of indicator species at the reference site and some primary forest specialists were not even found at the restoration site, showing the importance of the maintenance of primary forests in the fragmented landscape in order to allow passive restoration to recover original forest attributes.

TI  - Natural regeneration of woody and herbaceous species in ecological restoration areas in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration of forests is one of the most important tools for inferring about the behavior of forest restoration processes. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration in an area of Dense Rainforest of the Lowlands after 8 years of implementation of the restoration project. The area consisted of six treatments (factorial 3 x 2), with three levels of species richness, two spacings and three repetitions, in randomized blocks. In each treatment and in the mature forest three plots of 5 x 10 m were demarcated, identifying all woody and herbaceous individuals. Floristic diversity (H') and equability (J') were calculated, in addition to the Distended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The floristic diversity and equability were lower in areas undergoing restoration (H' = 1.82 nats indiv(-1) and J' = 0.51). The DCA resulted in the formation of distinct groups, which differ from the mature forest of the area under restoration. In all treatments, a large number of herbaceous individuals were registered (3,963), which may have negatively influenced the establishment of woody individuals (351). The statistics revealed that the shared treatments of many woody and herbaceous species, reinforcing that planting with greater richness of species is no guarantee of success in establishing natural regeneration with high diversity.

TI  - Epiedaphic macrofauna in areas submitted to forest restoration technologies in southern Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to characterize the composition of the epiedaphic macrofauna in areas undergoing initial forest restoration using different restoration technologies and to compare these parameters with a reference forest. The study was conducted in the experimental area of Ecological Restoration of the UTFPR, Dois Vizinhos/Parana state, in randomized blocks, composed of three treatments (RP-passive restoration, PAD-high diversity planting, and NC-nucleation) with four repetitions. Adjacent to this, the fragment of secondary native forest (FL), is used as a reference. The collections were made in November 2010 and April 2011, and three pitfall traps were installed in each plot. Richness and abundance were submitted to normality tests, homogeneity of variance and analysis of variance, and the Shannon and Pielou indices were calculated. The abundance data of the taxonomic groups were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA). To verify the differences in the macrofauna composition between the forest and restoration technologies, similarity analysis (ANOSIM) and percentage of similarity (SIMPER) were performed. We sampled 12,681 individuals, 3,018 in November/2010 and 9,663 in April/2011, distributed in 23 orders. The abundance and richness of the forest differed significantly from the restorative technologies in both assessments. The high abundance observed in the restorative techniques reflected the dominance of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Polyxenida. FL showed higher diversity and equitability, regardless the sampling season. The PCA separated the forest technologies by differences in the composition of the edaphic fauna, and the same did not occur between the restoration techniques. In ANOSIM and SIMPER the main orders contributing to the forest differentiation of the technologies in November/10 were Diptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Blattodea, and in April/11 Polyxenida, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera. The edaphic macrofauna was influenced by the degree of anthropic interference, being a good indicator of environmental changes and ecological succession observed in areas undergoing initial forest restoration.

TI  - Phenology, nectar dynamics and reproductive success of Inga vera (Leguminosae) in monospecific plantations and forest remnants in Atlantic forest: Dataset exploration
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Distinct approaches have been adopted for tropical forest restoration in the last decades. The long-term viability of these restored forests and their capacity to provide the required services demand continuous evaluation to guide future initiatives. In addition, the resilience and maintenance of plant and animals communities in restored forests in tropical regions are closely related to the recovery of animal-mediated interactions. We provide, in this article, raw data related to the reproductive ecology of Inga vera, one of the most common tree species used in forest restoration initiatives in the Brazilian northeastern Atlantic forest. Specifically, we explore data on phenology, nectar dynamics and reproductive success of I. vera in natural and planted (mono specific) populations. This data article is related to the research article "Pollination partial recovery across monospecific plantations of a native tree (Inga vera, Leguminosae) in the Atlantic forest: lessons for restoration" (Cruz-Neto et al., 2018) [1].

TI  - Linking amazonian secondary succession forest growth to soil properties
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin has suffered extensive deforestation in the past 30 years. Deforestation typically leads to changes in climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycle, and soil degradation. Vegetation succession plays an important role in soil restoration through accumulation of vegetation biomass and improved soil/plant interaction. However, relationships between succession and soil properties are not well known. For example, how does vegetation succession affect nutrient accumulation? Which soil factors are important in influencing vegetation growth? What is the best way to evaluate soil fertility in the Amazon basin? This paper focuses on the interrelationships between secondary succession and soil properties. Field soil sample data and vegetation inventory data were collected in two regions of Brazilian Amazonia (Altamira and Bragantina). Soil nutrients and texture were analyzed at successional forest sites. Multiple regression models were used to identify the important soil properties affecting vegetation growth, and a soil evaluation factor (SEF) was developed for evaluating soil fertility in Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols, which differ in the ways they affect vegetation growth. For example, the upper 40 cm of soil is most important for vegetation growth in Alfisols, but in Ultisols and Oxisols deeper horizons significantly influence vegetation growth rates. Accumulation of vegetation biomass increased soil fertility and improved soil physical structure in Alfisols but did not completely compensate for the nutrient losses in Ultisols and Oxisols; however, it significantly reduced the rate of nutrient loss.

TI  - Tree species richness, does it play a key role on a forest restoration plantation?
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic forest is considered one of the world's biodiversity conservation hotspot. Today there is less than ten percent remaining. Therefore it is necessary to restore these ecosystems. There are many ways of achieving restoration's main goals, but there is a lack of ecological studies that analyzes tree species richness as a variable. Thus, this study's goal is to investigate if there is a difference between a forest restoration in a gradient of tree species richness that varies from 20, 60 to 120 species, by using the litterfall as an indicator. Every month, for one year the forest litter was collected from litter traps that were previously installed. Results revealed that stands produced litterfall by the increasing gradient of species was of 5,370, 5,909 and 6,432 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The statistical analyses revealed no significant difference among them. Therefore this six-year-old forest restoration plantation shows no difference on the litter production by the tree species richness.

TI  - Challenges and directions toward a general theory of ecological recovery dynamics: A metacommunity perspective
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Global change degrades ecosystems worldwide. Scientific research has advanced our knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Comparatively, however, it remains unclear how ecosystems recover after disturbances. In this perspective, I contend that ecological restoration should advance toward a general, dynamic theory that describes the recovery rates and trajectories of ecosystems along restoration. This approach should address three fundamental challenges corresponding to three components of ecological systems: complexity (how do we quantify ecological restoration?), space (what are the spatial scales of restoration?), and global change (how does global change determine restoration's reference states?). A generic model and experiment based on metacommunities is used to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Given the extent of ecosystem degradation and the international consensus to restore ecosystems, revealing the patterns and mechanisms underlying recovery is a fundamental and timely issue toward a general theory of ecological restoration.

TI  - Performance of Five Native Atlantic Forest Species Planted in Containers of Different Size for Restoring Degraded Areas in Minas Gerais
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration in Brazil has gained relevance in the country's environmental agenda, due to the need for forest recovery of large liabilities of existing forests and participation in several international vegetation restoration agreements. However, forest restoration management faces challenges, it being necessary to create a database of species-level performances to increase the success of these projects. The objective was to evaluate the survival and growth of five Atlantic Forest native species (Anadenanthera macrocarpa;Ceiba speciosa;Cytharexyllum myrianthum;Hymenaea courbaril; andPeltophorum dubium) in plastic bags (1177 cm(3)) and tubes (180 cm(3)). Ninety seedlings (18 of each species) were planted per container. Plant performance in the field consisted of evaluating the increase in the diameter and height of seedlings of the native forest species. Diameter at soil level (DSL) and plant height (H) were measured at 42 months after transplanting, and the monthly periodic increments (MPI) of the DSL and H were calculated. Plant survival (SV) of seedlings was affected by the type of container, registering the highest SV rates in those planted in plastic bags.Cytharexyllum myrianthumandH. courbarilpresented high SV rates in tubes. The growth rate of the species at 42 months differed according to the containers tested.Cytharexyllum myrianthumpresented the lowest SV rates (16.7-27.8%), regardless of the container used in this experiment.Ceiba speciosawas sensitive to the reduction in size of the container, showing low SV in tubes (27%) compared with plastic bags (61%); i.e., this species did not tolerate conditions with root growth restriction.Anadenathera macrocarpaandH. courbarilshowed no differences in SV, regardless of the container used. The results assist the production of native species of the Atlantic Forest, reinforcing the need to understand performances in the field at the species level.

TI  - Enhancing climate change resilience of ecological restoration-A framework for action
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is a tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and yet its outcomes are susceptible themselves to climate change impacts. Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions - Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN - revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a "future-proofing" approach to restoration success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 through more climate resilient restoration.

TI  - Identifying target species and seed sources for the restoration of threatened trees in southern Brazil
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration of trees is often constrained by limited knowledge of the biology, propagation and management requirements of individual species. Consequently, restoration initiatives rarely incorporate less well-known species or those that are difficult to source and grow. We describe challenges associated with the restoration of threatened trees in the Araucaria Forest of southern Brazil, and analyse the effectiveness of methods used to define target species, identify seed sources and generate information on the phenology of rare or threatened tree species. A review of secondary data identified 71 rare or threatened taxa as targets for seed collection. We then surveyed 68.7 km of trails in 26 forest remnants, identifying and mapping 1,027 seed-producing trees of 38 species. Surveys confirmed the scarcity of several tree species (including seven species with an abundance of <0.04 individuals per km), and nine species showed no signs of fruiting during 3 years of phenological monitoring. These findings, together with limited knowledge and application of optimal seed collection methods, are significant factors impeding the recovery of these species within their natural habitat. Wider application of the results of this case study could support restoration of the Araucaria Forest with seedlings from a wider diversity of species.

TI  - HERBICIDE USE IN DEGRADED FOREST AREAS IN RESTORATION: EFECTS ON SOIL INVERTEBRATE BIOTA
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical control of weeds is an effective method used in planted forests and in forest restoration, which plays an important role in development of forest seedlings and reduces costs of intervention. However, when this strategy is not properly applied, it may have negative impacts on soil organisms and on the ecological processes in which they take part. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of herbicide use on soil biota through sampling of the soil fauna community and through ecotoxicological tests on the survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida and Enchytraeus crypticus in a target area of a recently-established forest restoration. A randomized block experimental design was adopted, with four treatments and five replications. Treatments consisted of applications of three post-emergence herbicides at different rates (mesotrione, 0.4 L ha(-1); fluazifop-P-butyl, 1.0 L ha(1); and nicosulfuron, 1.5 L ha(-1)). They were applied in the total area of the plots beyond an untreated check (without application). Two herbicide applications were carried out on the field under study at intervals of six months, and the plots corresponded to the treatments in both applications. A total of four soil samples were collected from each plot: sample 1, six days before the second herbicide application in the area; sample 2, one day after the application; sample 3, eight days after the application; and sample 4, 22 days after the application. The soil fauna community was evaluated through a modified Berlese funnel method using one soil sample per plot. Organisms were counted and identified in large groups in the laboratory. Ecotoxicological tests focusing on survival and reproduction of F. candida and E. crypticus were performed on one composite soil sample per treatment. One day after mesotrione application (sample 2), a strong decline was observed in average richness of organisms, Shannon's diversity index, and the Pielou uniformity index, as well as reproduction of E. crypticus. The double application of the herbicides fluazifop-P-butyl and nicosulfuron does not cause negative impacts on soil invertebrates, whereas the application of mesotrione has negative effects, even if temporarily. Great care must be taken in applying it in forest restoration.

TI  - Effects of forest fragmentation on pteridophyte diversity in a tropical rain forest in Brazil
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The impacts of forest fragmentation on the pteridophyte communities of the Una region of Bahia, Brazil, were investigated by comparing species richness and ensemble diversity among areas of large forest fragments (> 900 ha), small forest fragments (< 100 ha), and landscape matrix. We inventoried the pteridophytes below 1 m in height in interiors of small fragments, interiors of large fragments (control areas), edges of fragments, edges of continuous forest, capoeiras (initial stages of forest regeneration) and cabrucas (cocoa plantations). All ferns were collected following the plot method (plots of 120x10 m, each). Sampling units were established in the six main ecotypes of the Una region. These units were allocated within three sampling blocks of 5 per 5 km, which were chosen in order to include the largest forest patches that still remain. Results suggest that fragmentation has a negative impact on species richness at the matrix and the edges of forest remnants. A similar negative matrix end edge effect is reported for diversity of those sites measured by the alpha Log-series Index. However, small forest fragments have pteridophyte species richness and diversity rates similar to large ones so they should be considered of utmost importance to the conservation of forest-related species in the region.

TI  - Linking scorpion (Arachnida: Scorpiones) assemblage with fragment restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss due to forest degradation can induce changes in species richness due to variation in species susceptibility to environmental stress. This is particularly important for species with highly specific microhabitats, such as scorpions that inhabit forest habitats. In this study, the richness and abundance of these arachnids were compared between an old-growth (mature) and secondary (65 years under natural restoration) forests. Seasonal influence was also evaluated by comparing diversity between dry and wet seasons. The animals were collected through nocturnal active search using UV lamps and pitfall traps in both areas (old-growth and secondary). Both environments showed similar breast heights of trees, litter depth, litter dry mass, and understory density, indicating a high level of restoration. Scorpion diversity (characterized by Tityus pusillus, T. neglectus, T. brazilae, Bothriurus asper, and Ananteris mauryi) and abundance were not influenced by the different historical usage of both areas. In contrast, the abundance of these arachnids was highly affected by rain regimes, and increased during the dry season. These results suggest that 65 years was a sufficient time period for restoration, making it possible to maintain similar scorpion assemblages in both environments.

TI  - Priority areas and implementation of ecological corridor through forest restoration to safeguard biodiversity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological Corridors (ECs) are proposed as cost-effective solutions to improve ecological connectivity in fragmented landscapes. Planning the implementation of ECs must take into account landscape features as they affect the viability of the endeavor and the ECs associated costs. A novel set of geoprocessing tools were used to assess (i) economic viability; (ii) socioeconomic cost-effectiveness; and (iii) to determine priority targets for ECs establishment in a highly fragmented region of Atlantic Forest. Landscape features (e.g. size, edge density, number of patches), land use and cover, and Enhanced Vegetation Index data were obtained from remote sensing. Composition and configuration landscape metrics were estimated by geostatistical methods. Study area was represented by 35,344 forest fragments, of which 94% were composed of fragments smaller than 10 hectares in size, leading to a landscape characterized by low connectivity. We identified 13 priority fragments for protection and propose five ecological corridors. These five ECs connect six priority fragments, with a total of 283.93 ha of area to restore, on an estimated cost of nearly US$550.000,00. Conserving the biodiversity of one of the most threatened and fragmented tropical rainforest regions could be promoted at modest costs, through the protection of key fragments and their reconnection in the landscape.

TI  - Influences of tree species composition on understory microclimate of young restoration plantations
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies evaluating the pioneer tree species capacity to provide favorable conditions to natural regeneration in forest restoration plantings are still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether pioneer tree species affect differentially the microclimate conditions of the understory in forest restoration plantations. Two forest restoration sites, with three and five years old, were selected in a semi-deciduous forest in Itu city, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In each site, five individuals of five pioneer species were studied. In the three years old site, Luehea grandiflora, Schinus terebinthifolius, Solanum erianthum, Croton urucurana and Cecropia pachystachya were studied, and in the five years old site, plants of the species L. grandiflora, S. terebinthifolius, Apeiba tibourbou, C. urucurana and S. erianthum were selected. Each species was considered as a sampling unit. Tree species height and canopy cover, air relative humidity and soil and air temperature were analyzed. In the three years old restoration site no effect of species in microclimatic conditions was found. However, in the five years old restoration site, microclimatic conditions were significantly different among species. Therefore, the importance of a careful choice of pioneer tree species as ecosystem engineers which modify environmental conditions and facilitate natural regeneration in forest restoration projects was emphasized.

TI  - Beyond opportunity costs: who bears the implementation costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits.

TI  - Allelopathy of a native shrub can help control invasive grasses at sites under ecological restoration in a Neotropical savanna
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: African C4 grasses threatens newly restored areas in Neotropical savannas. Allelopathy exhibited by some native species may contribute to ecological restoration.Aims: To establish the potential use of Lepidaploa aurea (Asteraceae) in ecological restoration of invaded savannas, we evaluated its allelopathic effects on two invasive grasses, a native grass, and two native trees (one savanna and one riparian forest species).Methods: We tested the allelopathic effects of the leaves and roots of L. aurea in a growth chamber, a greenhouse, and in field experiments.Results: Leaf extracts reduced the growth of all other species in the growth chamber experiment. Root extracts reduced growth in one invasive grass and promoted root growth in the savanna tree. The invasive grass and riparian forest tree were negatively affected when planted in soil where L. aurea had grown, whereas the savanna tree showed increased growth. Lepidaploa aurea litter reduced growth in one invasive grass species and increased root biomass accumulation in the native grass species.Conclusions: Lepidaploa aurea negatively affected the growth of invasive grasses, through plant extracts, litter and through soil. These patterns could explain its ability to colonise abandoned pasturelands and its high success of establishing in restoration areas.

TI  - Evaluation of the success of forest restoration of riparian forests in the Amazon-Cerrado transition in Mato Grosso
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the success of forest restoration in three areas of riparian forest, in the transition between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Mato Grosso. Eleven 12 x 30 m plots were installed in areas 1 (A1) and 3 (A3) and twelve plots in area 2 (A2). The evaluation was made and the natural sociological coverage through the evaluation, diversity and similarity indices and coverage of grassy areas. A total of 1107 planted individuals, 30 species and 18 families were evaluated, with emphasis on Fabaceae, Bignoniaceae and Anacardiaceae. The density varied between 752 and 981 ind./ha and the basal area between 7.58 and 12.64 m(2)/ha. Senegalia tenuifolia (L.) Britton & Rose, Hymenaea courbaril L. and Inga vera Willd. they stood out as the most representative species in planting according to the IVI, with emphasis on S. tenuifolia in A2, with a regenerating overpopulation (8,425.93 ind./ha). The average canopy cover was 27.8% and the incidence of grasses was significant in two of the three areas. After seven years, the areas cannot be considered fully restored and adaptive management practices would facilitate the direction to the desirable ecological trajectory, however, new assessments of the dynamics and successional trajectory of these ecosystems are needed.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity and diversity of Meliponini bees in the Atlantic rainforest (RPPN of Michelin, Bahia).
T2  - Sitientibus Serie Ciencias Biologicas
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequently, the stingless bees or Meliponini (Apidae, Hymenoptera) are the most numerous group of floral visitors in the tropical forests, as the Atlantic Rain Forest (ARF). In the ARF, the Meliponini present variation in their diversity at local spatial scale likely associated with differences in vegetation structure and habitat quality. In this study, using honey baits datum, local spatial variation was measured and related to two stages of forest regeneration: intermediate and advanced (or mature forest). Stingless bee diversity (H' ) was similar in both forest stages. However, there is spatial variation in species richness with more abundant species (or dominant species) at the intermediate regenerated stage. Response to spatial heterogeneity was also expressed as differential foraging by forest strata, with most bee individuals attracted to honey baits at the higher strata. In contrast, a few stingless bee species likely showed foraging preferences for the low or high forest stratum.

TI  - Fire-sensitive and threatened plants in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, Brazil: Identifying priority areas for Integrated Fire Management and ecological restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme wildfires present an ever-increasing problem in different landscapes around the world. Here, we explore recent wildfires to prioritize recovery efforts and mitigate effects of future wildfires in the Pantanal, the largest continuous wetland in the world. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM), we categorize affected areas based on potential levels of degradation by fire and the predicted suitability for threatened and fire-sensitive plants. Based on this information, we identify key areas for fire prevention. Under land cover change scenarios predicted for 2050, approximately 25 % of the land cover under future threat will have potentially high biomass accumulation. We identified 1272 km(2) in priority areas with forest formation, with restoration cost of at least US$ 576,189. This case study provides an analysis workflow that can be used to assess other wildfire-threatened parts of the world. These results can inform public policy to establish new fire brigades, conservation efforts using Integrated Fire Management, and restoration areas to mitigate biodiversity loss.

TI  - Do the impact of organic residues on soil quality extend beyond the deposition area under oil palm?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of soil properties, tree layer and grass cover on forest regeneration in a mixed native species reforestation
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forest recruitment is important for maintaining reforestation over time. Different variables simultaneously influence the development of the regenerating layer and are fundamental to the success of reforestation. The main objective of this study was to assess the interference and facilitation imposed by soil, canopy and invasive African grasses on species richness, species diversity, numbers of individuals, and the average height of the natural forest recruitment at Mogi-Guacu, Brazil. The covariates assessed were: soil chemical and physical properties, tree layer, and invasive African grasses. The most significant covariates for tree regeneration indicators were the cation exchange capacity, water availability in soil, clay content, canopy openness, aboveground biomass of the tree layer, and grass cover. We conclude that soil properties did not impose a limitation to natural forest recruitment. In contrast, invasive grass cover interfered negatively on the diversity and structure of the tree regeneration.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF PIONEER-SPECIES COMBINATIONS ON RESTORATION OF DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of species composition and its effects on sustainability restoration processes in the Atlantic Forest with poor environmental attributes is important to improve rehabilitation techniques for disturbed ecosystems. Reforestation projects were used as Biological Measures (BM) of rehabilitation, where treatments differ in the composition of exotic species, utilized as anthropic pioneers: BM1 - 82% (73% Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, 9% Eucalyptus citriodora Hook.); BM2 - 91% (9%, 82%); and BM3 - 25% (15%, 10%). The monitoring of spontaneous regeneration was evaluated in three 12-year-old reforestation sites between thr rainy season of 2004 and 2005, and compared with an approximately 100-year-old native forest fragment and a grassland: ecosystems with inertial tendency toward recuperation and degradation, respectively. It was detected that exotic species used as anthropic pioneers strongly influenced regeneration: BM1 (75%), BM2 (85%), BM3 (55%), Forest (0%) and Grassland (50%). The highest similarity of species with forest regeneration (5%) was found for treatment BM3.

TI  - Assessing forest restoration effectiveness in the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion using epigaeic ant assemblages.
T2  - Journal of Tropical Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant initiated a large reforestation programme after the expropriation of the areas destined for the formation of the reservoir. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration of the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion, Brazil, using epigaeic ant assemblages as bioindicators, by comparing ant species richness and composition in the Reservoir Protection Strip with adjacent areas, such as the primary forest of the Iguacu National Park and the Permanent Preservation Area located on a rural property and agricultural areas. In total, 171 ant species were identified. Ant species richness was higher in forest than in agricultural areas and did not differ among forest areas. However, ant species composition in forest areas, regardless of the restoration technique used, was not similar to the primary forest, possibly due to variation in forest recovery time. This study highlights the great value of the Iguacu National Park as a conservation unit. Also, it reveals that the efforts for the creation and maintenance of the Reservoir Protection Strip, which remains without anthropic interventions for years, might indeed lead to a complete recovery of the ant species composition over time, reinforcing their great importance for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Landscape structure and local variables affect plant community diversity and structure in a Brazilian agricultural landscape
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity in agricultural landscapes depends on land-use types, natural elements, and farming intensity. The Brazilian Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot, however, the native vegetation loss rates have increased in the last years, leading several plant species to extinction risk. Here, we analyze the effects of local (soil fertility and litter amount) and landscape variables (patch shape, habitat amount, compositional heterogeneity, matrix dominance and connectivity) on alpha species richness and diversity, and basal area of different Cerrado vegetation types (savanna, forested savanna, and forest) using linear models and Akaike information criterion. We calculated landscape metrics at different spatial scales for 49 sampling sites in intensive farming landscapes. Woody plant diversity and richness were positively related to soil fertility and landscape compositional heterogeneity at 1500 m spatial scale. Plant richness was negatively related to the patch shape of remnants at 1000 m spatial scale. The effects of litter amount to explain the basal area varied between vegetation types. We found a positive effect in savanna and forested savanna and a negative effect in forest areas. Our findings suggest that the increase of monocultures lead to a decline on plant diversity in the studied landscapes. Also, local variables and the diversity of vegetation types need to be considered to design restoration actions in Cerrado. Sustainable intensification and biodiversity-friendly production systems may be alternatives to increase compositional heterogeneity, thus favoring plant diversity in Cerrado farming landscapes. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Identifying terrestrial carbon sinks: Classification of successional stages in regenerating tropical forest from Landsat TM data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has generally been usual to study the role of tropical forests as a source of atmospheric carbon, primarily through land-use change, such as deforestation, and biomass burning. Regeneration of forest on previously cleared areas, however is a significant carbon sink. The strength of this carbon sink is dependent on the age and composition of the regenerating forest. The ability to identify regenerating forest classes that may differ in terms of carbon sink strength was investigated with Landsat TBI data of a test site near Manaus, Brazil. A number of forest age classes were defined from a time series of Landsat sensor data, and their separability in Landsat TM data was assessed by maximum likelihood classifications. A high level of class separability was observed with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.8569 obtained for a classification of six forest regeneration classes. Of the classification errors observed most were found to be associated with the youngest forest age class. At the test site, however, two main successional pathways were followed and the differences between areas of forest of the same age but on different pathways was most apparent with the youngest forests. Splitting the regenerating forests by the successional pathway was found to increase classifications accuracy, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.9315 observed for an 11 class classification. A range of tropical forest classes that vary in strength as a carbon sink could therefore be identified accurately from Landsat TM data. Although the broader generality of the results requires further investigation this indicates the potential to use image classifications to scale-up point measurements of the carbon flux between regenerating forest classes and the atmosphere over large areas.

TI  - The impact of a run-of-the-river hydroelectric dam on a non-volant small-mammal assemblage in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are few scientific studies evaluating the impact of the loss of wetlands on the banks of tropical rivers on assemblages of small non-flying mammals. To understand the possible deleterious effects of hydroelectric construction in tropical forests on this group of mammals, we used data from 2 years of monitoring carried out during the period before the filling of a hydroelectric plant reservoir in the Brazilian Amazon, and related them to vegetation, soil and topography. We captured 659 individuals of 20 small-mammal species. The species assemblage composition in the flooded areas was a subset of species that occurred in both floodable and non-floodable areas, and only one species was captured exclusively in the flooded area. Species composition was influenced by the proportion of sand, by soil nutrient concentration and distance from water bodies. We conclude that there is no evidence that the flooding of low-lying areas along the Madeira River would negatively affect the assemblage of non-flying small mammals in the short term because the remaining areas have similar assemblages of small mammals as those destined for flooding. Whether the area lost will be important for population dynamics will depend on the conservation of the remaining areas.

TI  - Direct conservation payments in the Brazilian Amazon: Scope and equity implications
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article looks into the scope and equity implications of applying payments for environmental services (PES) as a REDD implementation mechanism in the Brazilian Amazon. We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers.

TI  - Impacts of livestock and pasture management on forest regeneration in Araucaria Forest remnants
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In some regions of Southern Brazil, historic silvopastoral systems, known as caivas in Santa Catarina State and faxinais in Parana State, are used in remnants of Araucaria Forest. In these systems, the herbaceous stratum of the forest is composed of natural pasture on which animals graze. In order to better understand the impact of caivas on the conservation of the Araucaria Forest, the effects of different intensities of pasture management, mowing practices, and cattle grazing on natural regeneration were assessed. The experiment was carried out in eight caivas from 2015 to 2016, during which the forest regeneration was monitored every six months. Throughout the study period, 48 tree species that are characteristic of the Araucaria Forest were identified. In all evaluated scenarios, the regeneration of tree species was present, dynamic, and continuous in the caivas. The intensity of pasture use did not affect the indicators of diversity, species richness, and regeneration density. However, there was limited similarity among caivas with the same type of pasture management. Mowing had the greatest impact on regeneration, with a marked reduction in the density of regenerants, although it did not affect species richness. Given the abundance of species in the regeneration, including many species typical of advanced forest succession, it is possible to confirm that these systems present high levels of resilience with respect to the conservation of biodiversity, despite the occurrence of livestock grazing for generations. The results also indicate that it is possible to successfully implement strategies for pasture intensification in caivas. However, this practice must be associated with preservation strategies in forest areas that are more fragile and diverse, in order to ensure the system is sustainable across all dimensions.

TI  - Smallholders' perspectives, motivations, and incentives for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration, recognized as a critical strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation, faces significant challenges in achieving widespread implementation. A particular facet of this challenge lies in the active involvement of rural landowners. Our study aimed to understand rural landowners' perspectives, motivations, and characteristics that influence their participation in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Qualitative content analysis was conducted on 68 semi-structured interviews with two groups of landowners: 36 who received support and 32 who did not receive project support from a local non-governmental organization to restore native forests on their landholdings. Approximately three-quarters of the sample are classified as smallholders (<80 ha). The main difference between the two groups is the dependence on agricultural production as the main source of income, with 22% of farmers in the supported group and 72% in the unsupported group. This socio-economic characteristic appeared to influence the decision to restore native forest. Farmers' focus tends to be linked to rural production, and the main obstacle to restoration was the loss of productive land. They usually allow natural forest regeneration to establish on slopes. The other type of landowner (lifestylers) mainly restored land through planting of seedlings, with the main barrier being the cost of restoration. Both groups had water conservation as their main motivation for restoration. Our study shows that understanding the perspectives and motivations of the diversity of rural landowners is crucial to effectively engage them and address the socio-economic feasibility of different restoration approaches.

TI  - Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration activities
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions.Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfil ling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The butterfly fauna of lowland monsoon forest on Buru, Indonesia was compared in unlogged forest and forest that had been selectively logged 5 years previously.2. Seven variables relating to vegetation structure were measured in each habitat. Tree density and percentage cover of vegetation in the canopy and understorey were significantly higher, and vegetation cover 2 m above the ground was significantly lower, in unlogged forest. There were no differences between sites in the mean heights or girths of trees, but the ranges of both heights and girths were lower in logged forest, Percentage cover of vegetation at ground level was similar at the two sites.3. Species richness, abundance and evenness of butterflies and an index of taxonomic distinctiveness were ail significantly higher in unlogged forest. Two endemic species and a further four species with distributions restricted to Maluku Province were recorded only in unlogged forest.4. Species abundance data for butterflies at both sites fitted a log-series distribution. Data for unlogged forest also fitted a log-normal distribution, whereas those far logged forest did not. This indicated the presence of a more complex butterfly community in unlogged forest.5. These results indicate that the distributional pattern of species abundance of tropical butterflies may be used as an indicator of forest disturbance, and that selective logging of tropical forests in SE Asia may be associated with a significant decrease in biodiversity of butterflies, at least during the first 5 years of forest regeneration.

TI  - Seed-dispersal interactions in fragmented landscapes - a metanetwork approach
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mutualistic interactions repeatedly preserved across fragmented landscapes can scale-up to form a spatial metanetwork describing the distribution of interactions across patches. We explored the structure of a bird seed-dispersal (BSD) metanetwork in 16 Neotropical forest fragments to test whether a distinct subset of BSD-interactions may mediate landscape functional connectivity. The metanetwork is interaction-rich, modular and poorly connected, showing high beta-diversity and turnover of species and interactions. Interactions involving large-sized species were lost in fragments < 10000 ha, indicating a strong filtering by habitat fragmentation on the functional diversity of BSD-interactions. Persistent interactions were performed by small-seeded, fast growing plant species and by generalist, small-bodied bird species able to cross the fragmented landscape. This reduced subset of interactions forms the metanetwork components persisting to defaunation and fragmentation, and may generate long-term deficits of carbon storage while delaying forest regeneration at the landscape level.

TI  - Can our current knowledge and practice allow ecological restoration in the Cerrado?
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological knowledge plays a significant role in ensuring efficient ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review to assess if sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused primarily on two vegetation types: cerrado sensu stricto (typical savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to advance Cerrado ecological restoration.

TI  - Protocol for Monitoring Tropical Forest Restoration: Perspectives From the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact in Brazil.
T2  - Tropical Conservation Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring protocols are needed to evaluate the millions of hectares of land that are being proposed for forest restoration in the coming decades. Standardized proposals are critical to evaluate efficacy of restoration strategies, identify triggers for corrective actions, compare results across projects, and generally learn from past projects to inform future restoration efforts. We describe an iterative process, including over 200 stakeholders, to develop a protocol for monitoring Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration. We give an overview of the ecological, socioeconomic, and management criteria, indicators, and metrics included in the protocol. Strengths of the protocol include the following: (a) testing and use across sites with a range of ages, forest types, past land uses, restoration techniques, and implementing institutions; (b) participation by a broad range of government, nongovernment, private, and academic institutions in the protocol development process; and (c) inclusion of socioeconomic and management criteria. Next steps for facilitating the broad adoption of the protocol in the Atlantic Forest region include providing in person and online training courses, establishing an online repository for storing and comparing monitoring data, and developing smartphone applications to facilitate data collection. Although the protocol was developed for the Atlantic Forest context and further refinements are needed, we think that the Atlantic Forest Pact monitoring protocol may serve as a model to inform the development of similar protocols in other regions, which ultimately could be integrated to produce a pantropical protocol for common use by several restoration forest programs worldwide.

TI  - Defining ecological restoration of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia declared an ambitious plan to restore its degraded and fire-prone peatlands, which have been a source of significant greenhouse gas and haze. However, the progress has been slow and the plan cannot succeed without sustained social supports and political will. Although many previous studies argued for the need to see ecological restoration in socio-economic contexts, empirical assessments have been lacking for how restoration is operationalized on the ground. We interviewed 47 key informants involved in four different projects in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and assessed their definitions, goals, and practices of peatland restoration. Most of the actors we interviewed defined peatland restoration primarily in an ecological context following the global concept of ecological restoration. However, all four restoration projects were designed without determining reference and trajectory conditions. Their intermediate goals and practices were more focused on engaging local communities and developing sustainable livelihood options than improving the ecological conditions of peatlands. To be internally consistent, peatland restoration needs to recognize a social dimension in its process, as well as in its goal. Setting clear trajectory conditions is also important to clarify achievable goals and measurable intermediate outcomes. We propose the following definition of peatland restoration: a process of assisting the recovery of degraded peatland ecosystems to achieve the appropriate trajectories defined through multi-stakeholder collaboration within social-ecological contexts. We hope to generate healthy debates to further refine the definition that encompasses both social and ecological dimensions to generate broader support for sustaining and expanding peatland restoration projects in Indonesia.

TI  - Insecta and Collembola as bioindicators of ecological restoration in the Ombrophilous Dense Forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity as bioindicators of litter arthropodofauna in pasture restoration in the Atlantic Forest Biome. Areas of native forest under natural regeneration, and pastures treated with different ecological restoration techniques were evaluated, with pitfall traps. The sampling period was from April/2017 to October/2018, bimonthly. Families Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae, and Leiodidae, species Pheidole cf. sarcina (Formicidae) and Mastigoceras sp. 1 and Szeptyckitheca sp. 1 (Collembola) were indicators of well-conserved areas, whereas families Cicadellidae and Delphacidae, Formicidae species Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863) and Camponotus melanoticus Emery, 1894 were indicators of degraded areas. From the springtail community, species richness is a metric that can be used as a bioindicator. It was observed that all taxonomic identification levels allowed for the differentiation of the environmental conditions of the sampling areas, with less specific identification levels, such as family, possibly indicating changes in areas under the restoration process.

TI  - Diversity among Stylosanthes species: Habitat, edaphic and agro-climatic affinities leading to cultivar development
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the introduction of Stylosanthes, a range legume, in India in early seventies extensive efforts have been made for its evaluation and adaptation. However, limited germplasm and narrow genetic base were major impediments in its wider adaptations. Of late, introduction of several new improved germplasm including newly identified species, cultivars and bred materials from Australia, Colombia, Brazil and Ethiopia and their evaluation at selected centers under different agro-climatic conditions improved the existing scenario as many lines including S. scabra RRR as well as newly introduced species S. seabrana has shown great promise for diverse agro-climatic zones. Because of concerted efforts which was largely generated from the recently concluded Austrialian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) stylo project and background study during the period of early eighties Stylosanthes has been considered as the most important tropical legume which not only improve the soil fertility but also provide nutritive forage. Two species namely S. hamata and S. scabra largely contribute to the supply of forages for cattle, buffalo, goats and sheep. As a nitrogen fixing legume, the plant helps replenish soil nutrients when used in ley farming, mixed and inter-cropping systems. The scenario has largely changed due to the better performance of newly introduced S. seabrana species which possessed high seedling vigour high nutritional parameters and better adaptation under rain-fed situations in heavy clay and cracking soil types. It provides good foliage and being erect and low sticky in nature showed compatibility for mixed cropping. Results also demonstrated reasonable yield in first year by all four major species which ultimately geared up in second year of growth. This was stable in S. hamata and S. viscosa for another two years whereas other two species namely S. scabra and S. seabrana indicated enhanced yield in consecutive years.

TI  - Dynamics of local governance: The case of peatland restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2016, peatland restoration policy is implemented in Central Kalimantan province through facilitation and coordination by Peat Restoration Agency (Badan Restorasi Gambut [BRG]), with the goals of reducing the peat subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to fire of peat areas. After years of implementation, local peat fires persist, however, and knowledge is still lacking about the challenges and opportunities for supporting the restoration process. This study examines policy implementation from the perspective of regional stakeholders by unraveling the dynamics of stakeholder interactions associated with the policy process. It reveals that the current state of governance somewhat restricts the ability of restoration actors to adaptively address emerging policy challenges and proposes measures for addressing these challenges.

TI  - POTENTIAL OF THE SEEDLING COMMUNITY OF A FOREST FRAGMENT FOR TROPICAL FOREST RESTORATION
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration projects are usually planted with a reduced number of species as compared to standing forests, largely due to the low availability of native species in seedling nurseries. In the present study, the potential of the native seedling community as a source of seedlings for forest restoration is analyzed. To do so, the seedling community from a forest fragment located in the southeast of Brazil was evaluated. Individuals (tree and shrub species) up to 30 cm height were measured and identified in 20 4 x 4 m plots. Altogether, 6,136 individuals (17 individuals m(-2)) belonging to 119 species were sampled. The seedling community showed a spatial heterogeneity with respect to the density of individuals and composition of species, and also a spatial aggregation for the 10 most abundant species. Several species that occurred in high densities in the seedling community are not presently available in regional forest nurseries and are therefore not used in restoration projects. This result and the high number of individuals and species found in the fragment suggest a great potential of this type of forest remnants as a source of highly diverse seedling banks for use in restoration projects.

TI  - Targeted habitat restoration can reduce extinction rates in fragmented forests
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and the Atlantic Forest of Brazil are two of the most fragmented biodiversity hotspots. Species area relationships predict that their habitat fragments will experience a substantial loss of species. Most of these extinctions will occur over an extended time, and therefore, reconnecting fragments could prevent species losses and allow locally extinct species to recolonize former habitats. An empirical relaxation half-life vs. area relationship for tropical bird communities estimates the time that it takes to lose one-half of all species that will be eventually lost. We use it to estimate the increase in species persistence by regenerating a forest connection 1 km in width among the largest and closest fragments at 11 locations. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, regenerating 8,134 ha of forest would create >316,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest. More importantly, it would increase the persistence time for species by a factor of 6.8 per location or 2,272 years, on average, relative to individual fragments. In the Atlantic Forest, regenerating 6,452 ha of forest would create >251,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest and enhance species persistence by a factor of 13.0 per location or similar to 5,102 years, on average, relative to individual fragments. Rapidly regenerating forest among fragments is important, because mean time to the first determined extinction across all fragments is 7 years. We estimate the cost of forest regeneration at $21-$49 million dollars. It could provide one of the highest returns on investment for biodiversity conservation worldwide.

TI  - Agroforestry systems, nutrients in litter and microbial activity in soils cultivated with coffee at high altitude
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are an alternative option for sustainable production management. These systems contain trees that absorb nutrients from deeper layers of the soil and leaf litter that help improve the soil quality of the rough terrain in high altitude areas, which are areas extremely susceptible to environmental degradation. The aim of this study was to characterize the stock and nutrients in litter, soil activity and the population of microorganisms in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plantations under high altitude agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Samples were collected from the surface litter together with soil samples taken at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from areas each subject to one of the following four treatments: agroforestry system (AS), native forest (NF), biodynamic system (BS) and coffee control (CT). The coffee plantation had been abandoned for nearly 15 years and, although there had been no management or harvesting, still contained productive coffee plants. The accumulation of litter and mean nutrient content of the litter, the soil nutrient content, microbial biomass carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, basal respiration, microbial quotient, metabolic quotient and microbial populations (total bacteria, fluorescent bacteria group, total fungi and Trichoderma spp.) were all analyzed. The systems that were exposed to human intervention (AS and BS) differed in their chemical attributes and contained higher levels of nutrients when compared to NF and CT. BS for coffee production at high altitude can be used as a sustainable alternative in the high altitude zones of the semi-arid region in Brazil, which is an area that is highly susceptible to environmental degradation.

TI  - Simple indicators are good proxies for ecological complexity when assessing Atlantic Forest restoration success
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Legal regulation related to restoration monitoring should be supported and validated by studies that evaluate the performance of indicators. In Brazil, a specific state regulation uses three indicators to attest recovery: ground cover with native vegetation (i.e. canopy cover, for tropical forest restoration projects) and density and richness of native plants spontaneously regenerating. Thus, we adopted other three ecological parameters: richness of zoochorous regenerant species (a functioning indicator linked to seed dispersal), the density of non-pioneer regenerants (a composition indicator), and dominance (a structure indicator), to test whether the indicators of the legal state monitoring protocol were associated to these more qualified indicators and we discussed the state protocol effectiveness. We evaluated 10 sites under restoration in the Atlantic Forest ranging from 9 to 45 years old and a reference area. Our results showed that the three indicators of the state monitoring protocol were associated to more qualified indicators in different restored sites and they can be considered proxies of ecological parameters to monitor and attest restoration success of tropical rainforest. In addition, dominance was strongly associated with richness of regenerants, but it was not associated to density, implying that richness and density of regenerants are not redundant and both should be monitored in the field. This kind of analysis could be usefully applied to define powerful and integrative indicators elsewhere, simplifying them without losing effectiveness as a means to stimulate wide adoption of monitoring protocols in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

TI  - The Effect of Forest Management on the Avifauna of a Brazilian Dry Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of tropical habitats has dramatic implications on biodiversity and represents one of the greatest conservation challenges of our time. Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), which are disjointly distributed throughout the Neotropics, are especially susceptible to human activities. The Caatinga Dry Forest, located in the semi-arid interior of northeastern Brazil, represents not only the largest and most biologically diverse nucleus of SDTF, but also the world's most densely populated semi-arid region, with ever-growing pressure on its natural resources. To prevent illegal logging, conservation agencies looked at forest management, where an area is divided in smaller stands which are gradually logged and allowed to regrow for a period of time, when a new cutting cycle should reinitiate. The impacts of these management schemes on biodiversity, however, remain largely untested. We conducted standardized avian surveys to evaluate the effects of forest management on the avian community at a 1,670 ha privately owned property located on the Chapada do Araripe, northeastern Brazil. This area was divided in 22 forest stands, half of which had already been logged at the time of our sampling, creating a gradient of logged and natural forests and an 11-yr chrono-sequence of forest regeneration. Our results show that logged areas present fewer individuals, fewer species, and different avian assemblages than unlogged forests. Such differences are mostly driven by forest-dependent species, which were overwhelmingly affected by forest management. Our results show that although logged forests tend to recover its height after a decade, they do not recover the originally forest cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Likewise, decade-long recovering stands continue to show lower species richness, lower bird abundance, and different avian composition than unlogged forests. We identified a set of bird species that are more affected by forest management (ecological losers) and a group of birds that apparently benefit from the referred changes in land use (ecological winners). We conclude that completely managing an entire area may cause the extirpation of several forest-dependent species. We therefore suggest keeping logged and unlogged plots intermingled, to avoid local extinctions and the complete modification of the original avifauna.

TI  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration by applied nucleation: A case study in the Pampa, southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the Pampa biome is still inadequate, with a gap in the knowledge of the successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration. Thus, monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration, as well as to ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for adaptive management actions. In this study, the progression of the techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was investigated using ecological indicators. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, in an area of riparian forest. The region belongs to the Pampa biome, southern Brazil. The evaluations took place in two different monitoring periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2021, in two areas, one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other under passive restoration. Ecological indicators of composition, structure, and function were measured, sampled in 10 plots through monitoring per area. The results showed significant differences between the monitoring periods in each area by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). The areas presented differences in floristic composition between monitoring periods by non-metric scaling analysis (nMDS), and differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER). The dendrometric variables (height, diameter, breast height, nuclei area, and crown area) presented a significant difference by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) in the evaluation of the development of the nuclei. The ecological indicators of structure (canopy cover, soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area under restoration by applied nucleation. In the area under passive restoration, the indicators of structure (litter thickness and soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period. In both areas, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. was the species that most contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring moments. In the development of the nuclei, the dendrometric variables were statistically superior in the second monitoring period, pointing to progression in the development of the nuclei. It is concluded that the restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied area, as the nuclei progress over time. The area under passive restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession. The study result provide support for the improvement in future restoration projects for riparian areas in the Pampa biome.

TI  - Protected-area planning in the Brazilian Amazon should prioritize additionality and permanence, not leakage mitigation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of protected areas (PAs) where human land uses are restricted, especially in Amazonian forests, is an important bulwark against global biodiversity collapse and climate change. Here we assess if restriction of land clearing within Amazonian PAs displaces deforestation pressure to adjacent forests, a spillover effect called leakage, or if it further inhibits deforestation around PAs, a spillover effect called blockage. Leakage can undermine the net impact achieved by PA establishment. We calculated the non-target and target impacts of 91 state-governed (non-indigenous) PAs established between 2005 and 2016 on satellite monitored deforestation rates. We then assessed how well the features of PM, like size and restriction level, explain the spillovers. On average, 2% or less of the assessed spillover zone was deforested more extensively (leakage) or less extensively (blockage) than the area expected to have been deforested without nearby PA establishment. Blockages outnumbered leakages regardless of the method adopted to calculate the deforestation baseline rate. Our results suggest the establishment of PM has inhibited deforestation both within their boundaries and in their adjacent surroundings. The 17 PAs that did not inhibit deforestation within their boundaries and the 19 PAs where leakage occurred were geographically concentrated in southern and western protected regions of Amazonia Legal. High-magnitude leakage of deforestation pressure from PM to their adjacent surroundings seems therefore to be rare in the Brazilian Amazon. For the most effective conservation of Amazonian forests, priority should be given to achieving additionality with any new PA and ensuring the permanence and enforcement of those already established.

TI  - Atlantic forest tree species responses to silvicultural practices in a degraded pasture restoration plantation: From leaf physiology to survival and initial growth
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation has led to ecosystem degradation in many tropical regions. Re-establishment of native tree species on degraded land presents challenges due to environmental stressors such as water and nutrient limitations, particularly from weed competition. Ecophysiological studies can help assess responses of native tree species to silvicultural practices and improve our understanding of processes that influence their establishment and growth. Silvicultural treatments borrowed from commercial tree plantations such as greater nutrient applications and complete weed control can improve best silvicultural practices in forest restoration. Two contrasting silvicultural treatments, "traditional" based on common management practices for reforestation of native trees and "intensive" based on commercial plantation silviculture, were evaluated based on tree mortality, biomass, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, soluble proteins, and nutritional status of 20 native Brazilian species, 2.5 years after planting. Intensive silviculture increased tree survival by 20%, showed higher aboveground biomass from 13% to 7-fold and increased photosynthesis of similar to 20% from 15.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 18.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), compared to traditional silviculture. Total soluble proteins were 14% higher with 6.7 mu g cm(-2) in intensive silviculture compared to 5.9 mu g cm(-2) under traditional silviculture. Eighty percent of trees showed greater N content, with a 13% higher average than under traditional silviculture (2.60 g m(-2) versus 2.92 g m(-2)). Average values of chlorophyll A, B, and total were similar to 8% higher under intensive silviculture, but not significantly different between treatments. Overall, intensive silviculture provided a positive impact on the restoration plantation. During the initial years of plantation establishment, intensive silviculture methods were effective in leading to significant increases in growth and survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Genetic diversity of reintroduced tree populations of Casearia sylvestris in Atlantic forest restoration sites
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest have shown more concern about genetic variability in floristic diversity in the last years. To create effective conservation policies, we need extensive knowledge on structures and patterns of genetic variation between natural populations and within them. We characterized the genetic population of Casearia sylvestris Swartz in an area under forest restoration processes (Iracemapolis, Sao Paulo) established between 1988 and 1990, and compared it to a natural remnant of semi-deciduous seasonal forest (Caetetus, Sao Paulo). The distance between locations is similar to 210 km. One hundred twenty-eight adult plants were collected, 64 individuals in the native forest remnant and 64 in the restored fragment. The genetic data were generated by the screening of six AFLP primers combinations with a total of 296 loci for each population. The forest restoration site presented overall higher levels of genetic diversity compared to the natural remnant area. The most likely number of genetic clusters found was three (K = 3). The genetic variation was higher within populations, either in the natural or restored site, than between populations. Farther, 25 candidate outlier loci were selected and separated into two groups giving support to future research with species adaptation in these different environments. Our results show that evaluation of restored tree populations of C. sylvestris is crucial to monitoring long-term restoration programs and understand if they persist over time. We hope that our results aim at species management and the establishment of others restoration projects.

CP  - International Workshop on the International Regime - Avoided Deforestation and the Evolution of Public and Private Policies Towards Forests in Developing Countries
CL  - Paris, FRANCE
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) is considered a significant mitigation opportunity. Forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon has traditionally been highest in the world and, thus, represents a likely target for future REDD initiatives. The paper presents an ex-ante assessment of the potential REDD costs in two of the three largest states in the Brazilian Amazon using official land use and cover change statistics. The two states, Mato Grosso and Amazonas, historically feature largely different land use dynamics. The findings focus on the Opportunity costs of REDD and suggest that at least I million ha of projected deforestation in Mato Grosso and Amazonas could be compensated for at Current carbon prices until 2017. Total costs may differ between US$ 330 million and over US$ I billion depending on how payment mechanisms are designed. Implications of payment scheme design for the political economy of REDD are discussed.

TI  - The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowgmund), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha(-1)), AR (66.414 Mg C h(-1)) AsR (65.73 Mg C ha(-1)) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha(-1)). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.

TI  - The Role of Protected Areas in the Avoidance of Anthropogenic Conversion in a High Pressure Region: A Matching Method Analysis in the Core Region of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global efforts to avoid anthropogenic conversion of natural habitat rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these areas with a focus on preserving the natural habitat define effectiveness as a measure of the influence of protected areas on total avoided conversion. Changes in the estimated effectiveness are related to local and regional differences, evaluation methods, restriction categories that include the protected areas, and other characteristics. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas to prevent the advance of the conversion of natural areas in the core region of the Brazil's Cerrado Biome, taking into account the influence of the restriction degree, governmental sphere, time since the establishment of the protected area units, and the size of the area on the performance of protected areas. The evaluation was conducted using matching methods and took into account the following two fundamental issues: control of statistical biases caused by the influence of covariates on the likelihood of anthropogenic conversion and the non-randomness of the allocation of protected areas throughout the territory (spatial correlation effect) and the control of statistical bias caused by the influence of auto-correlation and leakage effect. Using a sample design that is not based on ways to control these biases may result in outcomes that underestimate or overestimate the effectiveness of those units. The matching method accounted for a bias reduction in 94-99% of the estimation of the average effect of protected areas on anthropogenic conversion and allowed us to obtain results with a reduced influence of the auto-correlation and leakage effects. Most protected areas had a positive influence on the maintenance of natural habitats, although wide variation in this effectiveness was dependent on the type, restriction, governmental sphere, size and age group of the unit.

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of ecological ICMS (Imposto sobre Circulacao de Mercadorias e Servicos), by public managers in conservation, can help and foster environmental improvement in rural properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the destination of ecological compensation for restoration and appropriateness to the environmental legislation of rural properties in the municipality of Araponga, Minas Gerais (MG). Information on Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserves (LR) were obtained from the Rural Environmental Registry's database. Plans on environmental appropriateness were evaluated and they are: dense planting, enrichment planting, plant spacing, fencing, artificial bird perches and transposition of soil seed bank. A total of 197.39 ha in APP is without forest (26.19 % of APP area) in the rural properties of the municipality of Araponga. In relation to LR, 566.92 ha (20.95 % of LR area) face conflict. The total costs, per year, for all forest restoration techniques were lower than the average value of ecological ICMS received by the municipality of Araponga (US$ 186,873.21 year(-1)). Therefore, the ecological ICMS allocation to foment the practices of environmental appropriateness enables the compliance of forest legislation in small rural properties in Brazil.

TI  - Seed functional traits as predictors of seedling establishment success in Brazilian tropical forest restoration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several ecological filters in deforested and degraded areas reduce seedling emergence and establishment and hinder ecological restoration by direct seeding. Understanding whether functional traits are related to a species' capacity to overcome these filters and predict their field performance might improve the success of direct seeding techniques for ecological restoration. We assessed eight seed functional traits of tropical tree species, seeking those that best explained their establishment success in direct seeding restoration projects. We analyzed a dataset from 52 studies that tested direct seeding techniques with tree species in Brazil. From each study, we collected the mean establishment percentage for all tree species. Seed mass, cotyledon function, and germination speed were the only functional traits that significantly affected the species establishment percentage in direct seeding restoration projects. Species with larger seeds, storage cotyledons, and faster germination had higher establishment percentages. Choosing species with these functional traits for seed mixes will provide higher establishment percentages and, consequently, improve restoration success by direct seeding techniques.We assessed eight seed functional traits of tropical tree species, seeking those that best explained their establishment success in direct seeding restoration projects.

TI  - DIRECT SOWING WITH TRANSPOSITION OF LITTER AS METHODOLOGY OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the transposition of litter on direct sowing as a method of ecological restoration of degraded areas. The study was conducted in the Nursery Research at Federal University of Vicosa (UFV) in the open construction site, with a completely randomized design. We compared three different treatments with five replicates each, leaving also five plots as control. For the control plots only the topsoil from the construction site was removed. The other treatments consisted of direct sowing of four native species, two pioneers (Senna macranthera and Colubrina glandulosa) and two non-pioneer (Tabebuia serratifolia and Cedrela fissilis). Treatment I consisted of only direct sowing, treatment 2 of direct sowing with subsequent transposition of litter and treatment 3 of transposition of litter with subsequent direct sowing. The litter has been transposed from a fragment of secondaty semi deciduous forest located on the campus of UFV After two years, treatment 2 had a higher percentage of emergency of seedlings. In treatment 1 36 individual trees were found, only from sowing. In treatment 2, there were 312 individual trees and in treatment 3, 140 individuals, both with individuals from sowing and litter transposed. The transposition of litter influenced seed emergency and plant establishment. S. macranthera and C. glandulosa were the species with the highest percentage of emergency and, therefore, have potential for use in ecological restoration projects through direct sowing.

TI  - Seizing resilience windows to foster passive recovery in the forest-water interface in Amazonian lands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regeneration has increased in many tropical abandoned lands and current restoration commitments in this region aim to restore over 1,400,000 km(2) of degraded land by 2030. Although regenerating forests recover biomass, biodiversity, and processes with time, the recovery trajectories may be uncertain due to past disturbances. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge to sustain the effectiveness of passive regeneration for the recovery of riparian forests and the adjacent waterbodies in the tropics, which may compromise the outcomes of ongoing and future tropical riparian restoration programs. We evaluated the drivers of riparian forest structural recovery and how this relates to stream conditions in 12 abandoned pasturelands in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. These pasturelands range across regeneration age (pasture (PA) - 0 to 4 years; young regeneration (YR) - 8 to 12 years; old regeneration (OR) -18 to 22 years) and years of past land-use (PA - 23.25 average years of past land-use, YR - 18.25, OR - 7). We compared the conditions of these sites to 4 reference sites with conserved forests (REF, >100 years), where there was no recorded pasture use in the past. Short-term responses of forests and streams to passive regeneration indicated high ecosystem resilience after low to intermediate past land-use intensity, reflected in the improvement of stream ecosystems. Such high resilience is possibly attributable to low- to intermediate-intensity pasture-related disturbances, remaining forest matrix, and residual structures (e.g. roots, sprouts, and in-stream wood) observed in the area. Our results suggest a recovery by 12 to 20 years for riparian forests of this region. However, areas degraded by intensive land-use apparently showed delayed recovery. We conclude that seizing resilience windows (defined here as the period when ecosystems retain high potential resilience is essential to foster passive recovery of riparian forests and streams more cost-effectively in the tropics.

TI  - Connectivity value of Atlantic forest fragments: pathways towards enhancing biodiversity conservation
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate combination of remote sensing-based techniques with predictive modeling is critical to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on forest fragments' connectivity. Our study aimed to classify the landscape and evaluate its ecology in a highly fragmented region within the Atlantic Forest. We combined satellite image-based data, and spatial data of a region in Southern Brazil with Random Forest (RF) supervised algorithms. Using this combination, we defined the land use and native forest classes and estimated landscape metrics. Overall, native forest fragments varied widely, especially regarding their areas (ha), shape, and the number of core areas. Among all fragments, the one in the Rio Doce State Forest Park (PERD) holds the largest area, most regular shape, and the highest number of core habitats in the study region. However, most (64.4%) of the fragments, especially the small ones (< 0.4 hectares), are close to each other (i.e., average distances up 100 m). Our findings demonstrate that the closely connected fragments may be potential candidates to enhance forest connectivity, and support ecological restoration plans in the study region. Further, we indicated that fragments like the PERD Park are a conservation priority due to their importance in connecting smaller fragments.

TI  - Palynological approaches to forest restoration in Southeast Asia: Challenges and opportunities for Thailand-A systematic review
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Review
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) has experienced significant deforestation and increasing encroachment on its forests over time. This ongoing environmental issue arises from the persistent exploitation of protected forest areas by local communities, leading to further deforestation and the degradation of remnant forests. Although several organizations have implemented restoration measures, these efforts have primarily focused on reforestation. However, replacing once-diverse forests with only a single type of vegetation or non-native species undermines the fundamental objectives of restoration and exacerbates the vulnerability of these ecosystems, particularly affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functions, making them more susceptible to collapse. This paper reviews the application of paleoecology to conservation and restoration efforts in forests worldwide, with a specific focus on SEA, through a systematic review. Out of 833 documents related to palynology and forest restoration worldwide, 19 studies were selected for review based on their clear topical focus on SEA. Of these, 18 studies concentrate on Holocene sediments, while one examines the Pleistocene to Holocene transition. Most studies were conducted in Indonesia, primarily focusing on wetland restoration, particularly in peat swamps. The use of palynological methods in these conditions proves valuable for restoration strategies. Additionally, the review examined challenges and opportunities associated with the palynological approach to forest restoration in Thailand. The findings indicate that there is currently no up-to-date, in-depth palynological analysis in Thailand that incorporates forest restoration efforts. Nevertheless, the palynological approach offers valuable opportunities for forest restoration in Thailand and similar regions.

TI  - Assembly rules in a resource gradient: Competition and abiotic filtering determine the structuring of plant communities in stressful environments
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms varies depending on the environment. According to the stress-dominance hypothesis (SDH), assembly mechanisms range from strong abiotic filtering to competition as the environment becomes more favourable. Most evidence for the SDH comes from studies in gradients of conditions (i.e. abiotic environmental factors that influence the functioning of organisms but are not consumed by them). However, we hypothesized that in resource gradients, competition increases as abiotic filtering becomes stronger. To test our hypothesis, we set up eight plots at different sites along an abiotic severity gradient in the Brazilian semi-arid region (BSAR). In each plot, we identified and measured each woody plant species found, and we recorded 11 functional traits of the main species, dividing the traits into alpha (competition effects) and beta (abiotic filtering effects). We investigated the presence of phylogenetic signal in the traits, the community phylogenetic and phenotypic patterns, and associated the variation in these patterns with the availability of water and soil nutrients. We found phylogenetic signal for most (91%) of the traits analysed. The phylogenetic patterns varied from clustered in stressful sites to random or overdispersed in favourable sites, and we concluded that these phylogenetic patterns were the result of historical processes influencing community assembly in different environments in the BSAR. In general, the phenotypic patterns varied from clustered at the most stressful end to random at less stressful sites. Our results show that in resource gradients, any restriction of the resource (hydric or edaphic) intensifies abiotic filtering and, at the same time, increases the competitive hierarchy among species. On the other hand, stochastic processes seem to have a stronger influence under more favourable abiotic conditions, where abiotic filtering and competition are weaker. Thus, we conclude that the SDH is not supported in resource gradients.

TI  - Accounting for twenty-first-century annual forest loss in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using high-resolution global maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been mapped since 1986 by SOS Mata Atlantica in partnership with the National Institute for Space Research under the project named Atlas dos Remanescentes Florestais da Mata Atlantica (SOSMA). The mapping results depict a worrying scenario of over-fragmentation and reduction of forest cover. The limited information provided, however, may underestimate deforestation in this Brazilian biome. We analysed the use of new high-resolution global deforestation datasets to quantify 10 years of deforestation in a heterogeneous landscape, where forest fragments are immersed in an agricultural and urban matrix. We set up a framework based on high-resolution satellite images available on Google Earth to visually inspect whether the areas of Global Forest Change (GFC) and SOSMA considered to be forest loss corresponded to actual deforestation. Results showed that no more than 21% of the forest loss area of the GFC were considered deforestation of Atlantic Forest remnants. More than 55% of the mapped patches (counts) were considered misclassifications. Misclassifications varied throughout the years, revealing the absence of a clear pattern, and they were considered dependent on the year. Forest plantation, forest regeneration, and grassland were the main sources of misclassifications. Despite errors, GFC accounted for significantly more deforestation than the official Brazilian mapping of the Atlantic Forest (SOSMA), showing that many small forest fragments that are important for maintaining biodiversity are being lost with little or no concern about it. We suggest that instead of sustaining an entire national programme that relies on acquiring and processing imagery, it would be better to work alongside a global programme such as the GFC by providing visual inspection, cross-validation, local knowledge, and further improvements.

TI  - MACRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCY IN CARINIANA ESTRELLENSIS (Raddi) KUNTZE: FROM CHANGES IN CELL ULTRASTRUCTURE TO VISUAL SYMPTOMS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The nutritional requirements of native forest species can influence productivity. Thus, the understanding of these requirements enables us to optimize the use of inputs and reduce the environmental impacts inforest restoration projects. The present study aimed to evaluate changes in cellular ultrastructure and the anatomy of leaf laminae as well as observe visual signs of nutrient deficiency in young Cariniana estrellensis (Raddi) Kuntze plants, a forest species widely used in ecological restoration projects. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in random blocks with three replications of seven treatments using nutrient subtraction (I.e., control [plants grown with all nutrients], -N, -P, -K, -Ca, -Mg, and -S). The plants were harvested 135 days after the beginning of the treatments when the deficiency of the macronutrients resulted in visible abnormalities. Changes in the cell ultrastructure and structure of the chloroplasts, cytoplasm, and stromal lamellae were observed, as well as starch and lipid concentrations in the cytoplasm, intercellular spaces, and parenchymal cells. Changes in the cell ultrastructures, leaf laminae, and visual signs of nutrient deficiency hindered the development of young C. estrellensis plants; therefore, forest restoration projects that use this species in soils that require nutritional supplementation may have limited success in the absence of nutritional support.

TI  - Forest Restoration Monitoring Protocol with a Low-Cost Remotely Piloted Aircraft: Lessons Learned from a Case Study in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional forest restoration (FR) monitoring methods employ spreadsheets and photos taken at the ground level. Since remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) generate a panoramic high resolution and georeferenced view of the entire area of interest, this technology has high potential to improve the traditional FR monitoring methods. This study evaluates how low-cost RPA data may contribute to FR monitoring of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by the automatic remote measurement of Tree Density, Tree Height, Vegetation Cover (area covered by trees), and Grass Infestation. The point cloud data was processed to map the Tree Density, Tree Height, and Vegetation Cover parameters. The orthomosaic was used for a Random Forest classification that considered trees and grasses as a single land cover class. The Grass Infestation parameter was mapped by the difference between this land cover class (which considered trees and grasses) and the Vegetation Cover results (obtained by the point cloud data processing). Tree Density, Vegetation Cover, and Grass Infestation parameters presented F_scores of 0.92, 0.85, and 0.64, respectively. Tree Height accuracy was indicated by the Error Percentage considering the traditional fieldwork and the RPA results. The Error Percentage was equal to 0.13 and was considered accurate because it estimated a 13% shorter height for trees that averaged 1.93 m tall. Thus, this study showed that the FR structural parameters were accurately measured by the low-cost RPA, a technology that contributes to FR monitoring. Despite accurately measuring the structural parameters, this study reinforced the challenge of measuring the Biodiversity parameter via remote sensing because the classification of tree species was not possible. After all, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot, and thus different species have similar spectral responses in the visible spectrum and similar geometric forms. Therefore, until improved automatic classification methods become available for tree species, traditional fieldwork remains necessary for a complete FR monitoring diagnostic.

TI  - Policy sequencing to reduce tropical deforestation
T2  - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-technical summary Tropical deforestation continues apace despite a proliferation of commitments made by companies and governments to control it. Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix. Social media summary How do we stop deforestation? The policy options are well-known, but the order in which they are introduced matters.

TI  - Coordination and cross-sectoral integration in REDD plus : experiences from seven countries
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ever since a global mitigation mechanism that aims to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) was introduced in climate change negotiations, governance challenges in implementing this concept in tropical forest countries have received considerable attention. In particular, multilevel governance has been identified as a key challenge, as REDD+ aims to tackle local deforestation activities through a global results-based financial scheme. This paper will present an analysis from seven REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and Vietnam) where 293 qualitative interviews were conducted with national-level REDD+ actors. We examined what kind of multilevel coordination problems emerge, particularly in relation to horizontal, cross-sectoral coordination, and analysed these problems through the concepts of functional alignment, institutional complexity and accountability. We argue that there are problems with coordination that have emerged due to failures in recognizing the key multilevel issues. REDD+ is not adequately integrated into existing policies, and there is a gap between REDD+ and sectoral and national development policies. This leads to overlapping regulations and unequal resource allocation among sectors. Our analysis suggests that effective coordination mechanisms for REDD+ should be built on existing mechanisms and experience, include all the stakeholders, ensure the flow of information across the levels and harness the potential of REDD+ itself to overcome multi-sectoral problems. At the national level, there is great awareness of the issues that hinder coordination and effective REDD+ implementation, but this awareness does not seem to be matched by the actions taken to date.

AB  - Frugivory and seed dispersal studies are fundamental to comprehend the reproductive biology of plants. The aim of this work was to identify the species of birds that interact with M. coriacea, identifying its potentials dispersal vectors and assessing the use ofthis plant onecological restoration programs. The observationswere conducted on forest edgesat Serra doItajai National Park, in two different moments with complementary methodologies. In the first period between June 2001 and 2002 it was adopted the hour-plant (tree-focal) as observation unit, with 15 plants selected for quantitative records, distributed throughout the day and totalizing 21 hours of observation. In the second period, from January 2013 to August 2015, it was adopted the feeding-bouts method on existing tracks. Considering both methods, 31 bird species were registered. Among them stand out in the focal method the species Turdus rufiventris (Vieillot, 1818), T. amaurochalinus (Cabanis, 1850) e T. abicollis (Vieillot, 1818), which in short visits ingested entire fruits, just as Tangara desmaresti (Vieillot, 1819) and Chiroxiphia Caudata (Shaw&Nodder, 1793), forest species that promote the flow of seeds from more advanced stages of succession to areas under restoration. These ecological aspects authorize the use of M. coriacea in ecological restoration projects.

T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogeographical history and current ecological interactions have usually been addressed separately to explain the spatial distribution of patterns of biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated the integrated effects of biogeographical and environmental factors in structuring the diurnal amphibian anuran assemblages of the upper Madeira River, southwestern Amazonia. We used a sampling design involving 98 standardized units, distributed across seven locations covering both banks of the river's course in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. We conducted searches for frogs in three campaigns between February 2010 and February 2011, aiming to: (1) evaluate the effect of the Madeira River as a biogeographic barrier at the species-assemblage level, and (2) test the influence of seven environmental variables (vegetation structure, vegetation cover, soil nutrients, soil structure, slope, elevation, and distance from the river bank) on the spatial structure of the frog assemblages, separately on each riverbank. Thirteen species of diurnal frogs were recorded, six of which were restricted to one of the river margins. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the river as a barrier. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the environmental variables structuring frog assemblages differ on either side of the river. We found that both historical elements (on a regional scale) and environmental factors (at a local scale) shaped the occurrence and distribution of frog species in the study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate plant cover and dry mass produced by green manures and their influence on the chemical attributes of soil for the ecological restoration of an area around bauxite mine environment in Southeast Brazil. Soil preparation, chemical fertilization and sowing of three species of green manures were carried out: Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria juncea and Stylosanthes guianensis. In general, C. cajan and C. juncea showed the best performance in plant cover. C. cajan and S. guianensis produced more phytomass. Green manures were efficient to promote rapid plant cover and increase in soil organic matter and total-N contents in all treatments. Therefore, green manure is a viable alternative that contributes to the success of ecological restoration projects in areas in the bauxite mining environment.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The floristic composition and structure of vegetation in natural regeneration were studied in a degraded area in Matupa County, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, originally occupied by Tropical Rain Forest. Three plots were used in the shape of a 20 m x 160 m transect, divided into 10 m x 20 m sub-plots, placed parallel to a remnant fragment. Transect 1 was 0-20 m from the fragment; Transect 2, 20-40 m, and Transect 3, 40-60 m from the forest fragment. The total height and diameter at soil height of all the shrubs and tree individuals (height greater than or equal to 0.50 m) were measured to the 5, 13 and 18 months after the area had been systematized and abandoned. Floristic and structural alterations occurred in space and time. The number of individuals, species, families and diversity increased during the time interval studied and decreased with distance from the remnant fragment. These floristic and structural alterations in the community as a whole and in the populations of the most important species, Trema micrantha (L.) Blume and Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke, showed the tendency of a succession model by facilitation, where these pioneers would be improving the ecological conditions and thus easing the regeneration of late species. The conservation of the forest fragment in the surroundings was essential for the natural regeneration process of the forest in the degraded area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past 20 years the combined effects of El Nino-induced droughts and land-use change have dramatically increased the frequency of fire in humid tropical forests. Despite the potential for rapid ecosystem alteration and the current prevalence of wildfire disturbance, the consequences of such fires for tropical forest biodiversity remain poorly understood. We provide a pan-tropical review of the current state of knowledge of these fires, and include data from a study in a seasonally dry terra firme forest of central Brazilian Amazonia. Overall, this study supports predictions that rates of tree mortality and changes in forest structure are strongly linked to burn severity. The potential consequences for biomass loss and carbon emissions are explored. Despite the paucity of data on faunal responses to tropical forest fires, some trends are becoming apparent; for example, large canopy frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds appear to be highly sensitive to changes in forest structure and composition during the first 3 years after fires. Finally, we appraise the management implications of fires and evaluate the viability of techniques and legislation that can be used to reduce forest flammability, prevent anthropogenic ignition sources from coming into contact with flammable forests and aid the post-fire recovery process.

TI  - Arrested development? Investigating the role of bamboo in Araucaria Forest succession in Southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsAssessing the role of a dominant native bamboo species on tree species diversity and structure in the medium term.MethodsOver a 7-year period, we studied the natural regeneration of two dominant forest types in Southern Brazil (Araucaria Forest or AF; Bamboo Forest or BF) after a bamboo (Merostachys skvortzovii Send.) die-off between 2004 and 2006. The study was carried out in the Embrapa Research Station in Cacador, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.Important FindingsThe die-off provided ideal conditions for the establishment of several species and it kickstarted forest succession dynamics, which in turn affected regeneration diversity. Tree species richness was relatively stable with a transitory increase between 2007 and 2014 in both AF and BF. However, species richness rose in BF because of a relative increase in abundance of some species (especially late and secondary species) while a plunge in some pioneer species drove an increase in diversity. Overall, we found that BF has a lower diversity of recruits and that density declined over time, while AF is more diverse, with a more stable density. In BF, the bamboo die-off created optimal conditions for initial regeneration development (mainly fast-growing pioneer trees), which quickly transited to higher size classes. Yet, after this initial stage of pioneer recruitment, the number of recruits dropped followed by a virtual absence of growth regardless of the species group as a result of a quick bamboo reestablishment. As bamboo recreated a dense understory it reduced species diversity to original levels, suggesting a self-maintaining cycle that halts forest succession. On the other hand, the bamboo die-off had little impact on AF where a slow recruitment process typical of old-growth forests was observed. The results indicate that the die-off event had a temporary effect on species diversity i.e. restricted to forests where bamboos are dominant in a similar process described in other southern South American forests. As the first study to observe the medium-term forest dynamics related to bamboo die-off, we can conclude that when being dominant, native bamboos can hinder forest regeneration, maintaining lower levels of diversity and arresting forest succession that lasts well beyond the short-term, post-die-off effects. Many forest fragments in the region are dominated by bamboos, thus their potential for conservation is at risk and requires appropriate management.

TI  - Tree seedling responses to leaf-cutting ants herbivory in Atlantic Forest restoration sites
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf-cutting ants (LCA) are generalist herbivores capable of causing severe plant damage. Negative impacts of ant herbivory vary according to the density of nests and availability of palatable plants; however, it is not yet clear how these herbivores affect tropical forest restoration sites. To investigate how LCA preference affects plant species performance, we evaluated the herbivory of Atta sexdens rubropilosa on native tree species seedlings in Atlantic Forest restoration sites. We expected pioneer species to suffer higher herbivory by LCA when compared with non-pioneer species and that species with higher damage will have poorer growth and higher mortality. The experiment was conducted in three restoration sites in northern Parana state, southern Brazil, with 1,500 seedlings of 5 pioneer and 5 non-pioneer species. Sites share similar age, stand size, tree species composition, and LCA nest density. The number of attacks, degree of leaf damage, number of leaves, plant height, and survival were recorded. Specific leaf area, leaf polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and nitrogen content were analyzed for each species. Plant damage was similar between pioneer and non-pioneer plant species. This could be explained by trait variability among species in each group and by LCA generalist foraging. Preferred species suffered decreases in growth and survival. Less preferred species suffered fewer ant attacks and no change in performance. Results suggest that ant herbivory can influence plant species establishment and thus species composition in restoration sites by reducing performance and increasing mortality of some, but not all species, making LCA an important ecological filter.in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Detecting and interpreting secondary forest on an old Amazonian frontier
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land uses that replace tropical forests are important determinants of terrestrial carbon storage and biodiversity. This includes secondary forest growth after deforestation, which has been integrated into the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) concept as a means to enhance current forest carbon stocks. Incorporating secondary forest into climate change mitigation efforts requires both accurate measurements and a means to target interventions to achieve additionality. We demonstrate how remote sensing and household survey data can be combined to meet these requirements in 'old frontiers' of the Brazilian Amazon and introduce the idea that annual land-cover transitions - measured at the pixel level and over time - can serve as leading indicators of secondary forest regrowth. The patterns we observe are consistent with the suggested tension between equity and additionality in REDD+: the poorest households on the poorest quality lots already allow forest regeneration. Policy interventions to encourage regeneration are likely to have the greatest additional impact on higher quality lots owned by better capitalized households.

TI  - Assessing the quality of constructed technosols enabled holistic monitoring of ecological restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil quality index (SQI) serves as a general ecological restoration indicator, however, statistics approaches that accurately assess the minimum data set (MDS) for SQI remain susceptible. The present study aims to evaluate the short-term reclamation results at the Ferro-Carva similar to o stream and propose a system for ecological restoration monitoring, by selecting influential attributes and indexing soil quality. We hypothesized that the reclamation activities at the Ferro-Carva similar to o stream, referred to as the "Marco zero" (MZ) area, can bring its soil quality to levels comparable to those of the native area. We collected soil samples at 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths from transects of MZ and reference sites (R1 and R2). Principal component analysis showed the MDS for each soil depth. Permutational analysis of variance, in conjunction with Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, exposed relationships between transects of areas. An additive non-linear factorial algorithm allowed SQI assessment. The results indicated a similar soil quality between transects of areas at 0-20 cm depth, whereas a dissimilarity at 20-40 cm. To sum up, reclamation activities allowed MZ-constructed Technosol to present a soil quality similar to native areas. The soil quality assessment at both depths offered insights into reclamation activities' immediate and long-term impacts on the Ferro-Carva similar to o stream. This robust framework effectively monitors ecological restoration progress and guides future efforts in post-mining and post-dam collapse sites.

TI  - Taxonomic and trophic groups diversity of soil invertebrates positively respond to restoration of riparian forests
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - A successful restoration of riparian forests can recover the diversity of several groups of soil invertebrates. However, few studies have considered the recovery of the entire community of soil macrofauna and the relative effect in taxonomical and functional diversity. We evaluated how taxonomical diversity, in terms of abundance and richness, relates to trophic diversity in four patches of riparian forests that had been artificially recovered, and compared them to the reference site in Volta Grande Reservoir, Brazil. No relationship was found between taxonomic diversity and trophic diversity, suggesting functional redundancy among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we observed that the taxonomic group with more species presented higher trophic diversity than the rest, indicating low functional redundancy within this group. The abundance and the taxonomic and functional richness of the four restored sites was similar to the reference site. The forest recovery was efficient in recovering invertebrate soil community since the taxonomic and trophic composition recorded in our study were similar to the composition of natural areas. We emphasize the importance of studying edaphic fauna as a community in order to comprehend how it reacts to forest restoration.

TI  - Climate change is expected to restructure forest frugivorous bird communities in a biodiversity hot-point within the Atlantic Forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF.

TI  - Monitoring the structure of forest restoration plantations with a drone-lidar system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We are in an unprecedented moment for promoting forest restoration globally, with international and regional pledges to restore at least 350 million hectares by 2030. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is necessary to go beyond traditional plot-scale assessments and develop cost-effective technologies that can monitor the structure and function of restored forests at much broader scales. Lidar remote sensing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be an agile and autonomous method for monitoring forest restoration projects, especially under conditions when information updates are frequently needed in relatively small areas or, when using an airplane borne lidar system may be not financially viable. Here, we explored the potential of an UAV-borne lidar system to assess the outcomes of a mixed-species restoration plantation experiment, designed to maximize aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation. The experiment was established in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, with 20 native tree species, by combining two levels of planting density and two management levels, totaling four treatment combinations and one control (plots left over for natural regeneration). We analyzed three structural variables from lidar data (canopy height, gap fraction and leaf area index) and one from field inventory data (AGB). Structural differences between the treatments and the control plots were reliably distinguished by the UAV-borne lidar system. AGB was strongly correlated with canopy height, allowing us to elaborate a predictive equation to use the UAV-borne lidar system for monitoring structural features in other restoration plantations in the region. UAV-borne lidar systems showed enormous potential for monitoring relatively broad-scale (thousands of hectares) forest restoration projects, providing an important tool to aid decision making and accountability in forest landscape restoration.

TI  - Structure and floristic composition of a Cerrado sensu stricto and its relevance to ecological restauration
T2  - Hoehnea
M3  - Article
AB  - Edges are transition areas between two adjacent ecosystems that can be originated by natural or anthropogenic events. The edge influence includes both direct effects, related to changes on microenvironmental factors, as well as indirect effects, related to changes in species interactions. Additionally, some studies suggest that microenvironmental factors are altered by the cardinal orientation of the edge. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of edge on microenvironmental factors, local soil conditions, woody vegetation structure, and species richness in a Cerrado sensu strict at Itirapina, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Specifically, we investigated whether microenvironmental factors (relative humidity (%), photosynthetic active radiation (PAIR), temperature and percentage of canopy cover), soil conditions and vegetation composition differ among plots (36 plots of 25 x 2 m spaced 50 m apart) distributed on the edge and in the interior, facing east and south sides of the Cerrado. We sampled all woody trees and treelets with circumference 23 cm at 30 cm from its ground base within each plot. The microenvironmental variables relative humidity, PAR (photosynthetic active radiation), temperature and percent of canopy openness, and the soil samples (0-20 cm deep) for nutrients and texture analyses, were all collected at three points within each plot. We recorded a total of 120 woody species distributed among 40 plant families. Among the structural parameters of vegetation, only the absolute density was significantly higher in the interior south of the Cerrado. The microenvironmental factors were significantly different between the east and south sides, but did not differ between edge and interior. Therefore, based on the environmental and structural parameters we evaluated, there was no evidence of edge influence in the Cerrado studied. However, the east and south faces and associated microenvironmental factors, and the presence of some nutrients in the soil, such as Mn, affected the Cerrado vegetation structure and species composition. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the cardinal orientation in addition to the soil nutrient and microenvironment parameters to better understand the factors influencing the vegetation at a local scale.

TI  - Do alien species dominate plant communities undergoing restoration? A case study in the Brazilian savanna
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the principles established by the Society for Ecological Restoration International - SER is that the use of exotic species for restoration purposes should be avoided, and this is outlined on the two first attributes expected of a restored ecosystem by the SER Primer. This recommendation is possibly based on the hypothesis that exotics will dominate the restored communities and jeopardize the local biodiversity. We assessed the current plant community in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado undergoing restoration, where 42 species - 6 natives and 36 non-natives were planted, and compared it with the contiguous native community. We aimed at verifying if the surrounding native community has been invaded by alien species, and if the community being restored has been dominated by the latter, not resembling the native flora. Eight years after planting, the alien species were not recorded in the surrounding native ecosystem. In the community undergoing restoration, despite 94% of the planted trees being exotics (86% of the species) they corresponded to only 3% of plants regenerating (14% of the species), indicating that floristic similarity with the native vegetation is increasing over time. We consider that the non-native species planted do not offer threat to the native ecosystems in the vicinity, and tend to be defeated by the natives in the long term. Even though, public policies should prioritize and make feasible the use of native species, better adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Cerrado.

AB  - Tropsoil translocation has been effective for the restoration of plant communities, but until recently this method had not been used for tropical dry forest restoration. We tested different methods of topsoil deposition for restoring a dry forest on an abandoned limestone quarry. We also tested the effects of irrigation during the first dry season after topsoil deposition. The study was conducted in the Federal District of Brazil. A 2.1-ha area was cleared of vegetation, and the topsoil from that site was deposited on an exotic pasture field 1.4 km away. First, a secondary forest was clear-cut, and the first 30 cm of topsoil were removed and translocated. The soil was transported in dump trucks to the deposition site, which had been scarified in advance, and deposited by either forming 1.25-m-tall mounds or by leveling the soil into a 40-cm or 20-cm deep layer using a hydraulic excavator. The seed bank and the availability of root and stem fragments in the soil were both surveyed. The origin of the regenerants was categorized as either from seed or resprouting. We estimated vegetation cover for each life form, and measured all trees and lianas. After six months, 74% of the tree individuals and 60% of the liana individuals came from resprouting. Ruderal herbs and shrubs germinated from seeds. After 28 months, there were 51 species of trees, 8 species of lianas, 12 species of shrubs, and 34 species of herbs in the deposition treatments. The three deposition treatments were thickly covered with herbaceous/shrubby species, and had nine times the number of species (44 vs. 5) and five times the tree density (1.17 ind./m(2) vs. 0.25 ind./m(2)) as the non deposition control. Tree survival was relatively high in both the non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The total cost of topsoil translocation was 9604 USD, and the output was 0.43 ha deposited/ha excavated when forming mounds of soil, 5951 USD and output of 0.75 when leveling to a 40-cm layer, and 3551 USD and 1.5 for a 20-cm layer of deposited material. However, deposition and transportation costs are fixed costs of establishing a new quarry that can be deducted from the total cost of restoration. Topsoil translocation was effective in kick-starting the succession process of a tropical dry forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating the success of direct seeding for tropical forest restoration over ten years
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding is considered a feasible alternative for large-scale forest restoration, but little is known about the successional trajectory of tropical forests restored through direct seeding. To validate this method, we must understand how it changes forest structure and species richness and shapes the community trajectory as compared to the standard methods of natural regeneration and seedling planting. We evaluated restoration sites up to 10 years old in the Xingu river basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our objectives were to: (i) describe changes in vegetation structure and richness in restored forests within the first decade; (ii) compare the outcome of restoration by direct seeding (broadcast seeding, sowing in rows, or placing seeds in holes) to seedling planting and natural regeneration; (iii) evaluate the influence of environmental variables (annual precipitation, soil phosphorus content, sand percentage, and soil base saturation) and the direct seeding technique on forest structure. We assessed species richness, density of individuals per size class, basal area, canopy height, aboveground biomass, and canopy cover. We sampled 72 direct-seeded sites between 1 and 10 years old, three seedling planting sites and six natural regeneration sites aged 7 to 9 years old. Community structure attributes changed over time, with the exception of the density of regenerating individuals. After four years, direct-seeded sites had formed a multi-layered canopy and were starting to be colonized by non-planted species. In general, direct-seeded sites had high aboveground biomass, but there was high variability among sites, especially after age six years. Sites with higher phosphorus content had more tree density, basal area, and biomass compared to the others. Broadcast seeding sites had higher seedling and sapling densities than sites that received other restoration methods. In conclusion, direct seeding was a successful method for the initial phase of forest restoration, promoting a structure that was more similar to resilient natural regeneration sites than to non-resilient natural regeneration sites and seedling planting sites.

TI  - The impact of sustainability criteria on the costs and potentials of bioenergy production - Applied for case studies in Brazil and Ukraine
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this paper is to analyse the impact of the implementation of a certification system on the management system (costs) of and the availability of land (quantity) for bioenergy production. Twelve socio-economic areas of concern (food supply, child labour, (minimum) wages, employment, health care and education) and environmental areas of concern (soil erosion, depletion of fresh water resources, nutrient losses and soil nutrient depletion, pollution from chemicals and biodiversity) are included. Since there is no generally accepted definition of sustainability, a loose and strict set of criteria are defined. Short rotation coppice (SRC) production systems in Ukraine and South East Brazil in 2015 are taken as case studies. The results indicate that it seems feasible to produce biomass for energy purposes at reasonable cost levels and meeting strict sustainability criteria at the same time. The loose set of criteria has no impact on the costs of energy crop production, which are calculated to be 1.7 (sic) GJ(-1) in Brazil and 2.1 (sic) GJ(-1) in Ukraine. The strict set of criteria results in an increase of the costs of energy crop production by 42 % in Brazil and 14 % in Ukraine. In general, compliance with strict socio-economic criteria has a limited impact on the costs, because SRC is relatively labour extensive. Strict environmental criteria likely have a larger impact.

TI  - Community Managed Protected Areas Conserve Aboveground Carbon Stocks: Implications for REDD
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) represent a broad spectrum of outcomes and governance systems. Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs' effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs' effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Peten (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs' temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Peten (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre's Community Managed PAs' have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

TI  - Recovery of dung beetle assemblages in regenerating Caatinga dry forests following slash-and-burn agriculture
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding patterns of tropical forest resilience is a central challenge in conservation ecology particularly in seasonally-dry tropical forests, where anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are pervasive threats. Here, we investigate the recovery rate and community organization of dung beetles along a Caatinga dry forest regeneration cline in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture in northeast Brazil. Assemblages were described considering a wide set of attributes, including abundance, taxonomic (Hill orders D-0, D-1 and D-2) and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and redundancy) and taxonomic/functional composition, across a chronosequence consisting of regenerating and old-growth forest stands exposed to different levels of aridity and chronic disturbance. In addition, we use body mass, diet, food relocation behaviour and habitat specificity of dung beetles as ecological attributes. Our results show that Caatinga dry forests supports dense but relatively impoverished dung beetle assemblages at both local and landscape scales, with the same small set of species dominating local assemblages. Dung beetles do not experience successional replacements along the regeneration gradient, with evidence of high resilience. Moreover, disturbance-associated dung beetle species (predominantly small-bodied generalists) resulted in assemblage convergence across the regeneration cline. Finally, chronic anthropogenic disturbance was a decisive driver of changes in abundance and taxonomic diversity, while aridity positively affected species composition and functional richness. These patterns resulted in the occurrence of spatially structured assemblages in response to a combination of both natural and anthropogenic variables, while under little or no influence of forest regeneration status across human-modified Caatinga landscapes. We conclude that the absence of directional changes in dung beetle assemblages through the forest succession pathway of regenerating second-growth forest is associated with the effect of aridity and human disturbances on community organization, including selection for certain species and functional groups, which in turn, can alter important ecological functions and consequently the resilience of dry forests.

TI  - Reconciling Conflict of Interest in the Management of Forest Restoration Ecosystem: A Strategy to Incorporate Different Interests of Stakeholders in the Utilization of the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Harapan Rainforest is the only remaining lowland rainforest in Sumatera Island, Indonesia, that the Ministry of Forestry has designated for restoring lowland rainforest ecosystems. In the Harapan Rainforest, several stakeholders are interested in using the forest for several things. For example, the local community uses the forestland for their oil palm plantation, while PT Restorasi Ekosistem Indonesia (PT REKI) as forest manager, uses the forest for ecosystem restoration goals, causing a conflict of interest. This study aims to identify the stakeholders involved and provide a policy recommendation for the contestation in the Harapan Rainforest. We conducted key-person interviews to identify the stakeholders involved and analyze the interest and influence of all important stakeholders related to the utilization of the the Harapan Rainforest. The stakeholder analysis method analyzes and categorizes stakeholders' interests and influences in the Harapan Rainforest utilization. According to the study, three of the eight stakeholders have a direct role in the Harapan Rainforest's utilization. The last section of this paper ends by giving an alternative strategy for considering policy options and a win-win solution that prioritizes all stakeholders' interests. This study concludes that the utilization of the Harapan Rainforest should be conducted with multiple-use forest management for production and rehabilitation.

TI  - Natural forest regeneration in abandoned sugarcane fields in northeastern Brazil: floristic changes
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveys were undertaken to examine the floristic changes during secondary succession in three areas of 12 and three of 20-year-old secondary forests in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Two hundred and six species were identified, with 136 being found in the 12-year-old secondary forest and 161 species in the 20-year-old forest. Fabaceae and Myrtaceae were the most important families, increasing in species numbers with regeneration age. Of the 216 species, 115 were trees, 48 shrubs, 16 herbaceous plants, and 24 woody lianas, without significant differences between the two regeneration site ages. NMDS analysis revealed a formation of two floristic groups, distinguishing secondary and mature forests, with a further division within secondary forests in accordance with the time since abandonment. Similarity analysis ANOSIM confirmed the significance of the groups, which had floristic composition significant distinct (R=0.96) and 63% of dissimilarity (SIMPER). However, the sharing of 68 arboreal species between the secondary and mature forests suggests a floristic convergence. DCA analysis of the arboreal component as well as the other plant habits suggested that the separation of the subgroups is correlated with physical and chemical variables of the soils. All of these results indicate that, within the chronosequence analyzed, the velocity and direction of the floristic composition during secondary succession was influenced not only by the time of their abandonment, but also by a wide range of environmental variables.

TI  - Reintroduction by transplanting seedlings from natural regeneration: an alternative for ecological restoration?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Collecting and transplanting wild seedlings and mature plants have been used in restoration projects to reduce costs and increase conservation of local genetic material. We review the published literature on restoration projects that used transplanted seedlings and mature plants for ecological restoration. Searching the Web of Science platform using five keywords for articles published in 1945-2023 resulted in 621 articles, with only 51 (9%) of them relevant to the topic. We categorized these 51 publications by ecosystem type, the number and growth forms of species, plant survival rate, as well as the time and cost of transplantation. Forests and wetlands were the most researched ecosystems, and most articles studied tropical forests and the southeastern region of Brazil. Nearly half of the studies (44%) used trees for transplantation, and 73% focused on only one species. In wetlands, mainly aquatic herbs were transplanted (38%). Survival was highest in wetlands (lakes) and lowest in temperate and tropical forests, regardless of the number of species or growth forms. Only three articles (7%) included costs or the time frame of the process of transplantation or monitoring. Despite having few published studies, this practice has high potential for the ecological restoration of tropical and temperate forests. Seedlings and adult plants from natural regeneration can be transplanted to complement or even replace conventional methods of planting nursery seedlings and direct sowing.

TI  - The effects of nucleation and species functional traits on tree seedling performance in the early stage of ecological restoration
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The initiation of a new plant community in a restoration area hinges on the performance of seedlings post-planting. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of species functional traits-specific leaf area (SLA), wood density (WD), seed dry mass (SDM), and potential height (H)-on the seedling performance 25 months after planting, comparing two planting designs (rows and clusters) and the influence of fertilization addition in clusters. The restoration area is a riparian tropical forest located on the coastal plain at Caraguatatuba municipality, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We monitored 3017 tree seedlings and estimated their survivorship and relative growth rate (RGR) using the diameter, height, and canopy area of the surviving seedlings and the stem biomass for the cluster RGR estimation. Using linear mixed models, we analyzed how the planting designs and the functional traits affect species survival and their RGR. We underscored the significance of slow-growth traits (low SLA, and high SDM and WD) in enhancing species survival, whereas, maximizing species growth entails prioritizing seedlings with greater potential height. Cluster survival and growth improved with a greater abundance of species with low values of SDM (i.e., fast-growth species) and communities with low functional divergence (high similarity). Fertilized clusters improved the RGR of large-seeded species. Accounting for functional traits in restoration is advantageous for enhancing seedling performance at the species level, which is an important consideration for restoration practitioners. To optimize applied nucleation, clusters should target functional diversity at this community level and include competitive species to improve productivity.

TI  - Employment of Litterfall in the Assessment of Forest Restoration Systems in Alegre, ES
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the litterfall accumulated in two forest restoration systems deployed in the Area of Ecological Interest "Laerth Paiva Gama" in the municipality of Alegre, State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, by comparing them to the native forest (NF). The following restoration systems were evaluated: an intercropping system using eucalyptus and acacia (REA) and a system with diverse species (RDS). Litter was collected with the aid of a 0.25 m(2) collector, performing 16 repetitions per site. After collection, the litter was put in oven for drying and determination of dry weight. The forest restoration systems showed values of accumulated litter similar to the native forest area, producing an overall average of 5.61 Mg ha(-1). Both systems significantly reached their goals of litterfall deployment, with neither of them proving to be superior to the other.

TI  - Discovered on the brink of extinction: a new species of pygmy-owl (Strigidae: Glaucidium) from Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil.
T2  - Ararajuba
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaucidium mooreorum sp. nov. (Pernambuco Pygmy-Owl) is described based on two study skins (Ornithological Collection of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco No. 1030 (holotype) and No. 1017) from the Reserva Biologica de Saltinho (8[degree]44[minute]S, 35[degree]11[minute]W, elevation 140 m), Rio Formoso, Pernambuco, Brazil. This new species is only known from tall second-growth forests at two lowland (< 150 m) localities in the state of Pernambuco, being possibly related to the Least Pygmy-Owl (G. minutissimum) species complex. Glaucidium mooreorum sp. nov. differs from the two geographically closest species (G hardyi, from Amazonia, and G. minutissimum from southeastern Brazil) of this complex by plumage coloration, morphometric data, and vocalization. The region in which G. mooreorum sp. nov. was found is a quite distinctive area of endemism (Pernambuco Center) for birds and other groups of organisms in South America. From a historical viewpoint, the avifauna of this area is composed of two distinct elements, as its endemic taxa have their closest relatives either in Amazonia or in the Atlantic Forest south of the Sao Francisco River. The new species is apparently on the brink of extinction and we present evidence to rank it as "critically endangered". A bioregional planning involving forest restoration in critical areas as well as the establishment of ecological corridors to connect the few remaining large forest fragments is suggested as the best strategy to rescue the unique biota of the Pernambuco Center from extinction.

TI  - Floristic Composition of Restored Atlantic Riparian Forests on The Coast of S?o Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on floristic composition are important to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration and to support conservation of tropical forests. Presence of planted exotic species and low species richness in several riparian forests in Brazil led us to analyze the floristic composition of restored riparian areas in a region with one of the highest levels of vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest and immersed in one of the largest centers of endemism in this hotspot. Restored areas were identified through consultation of licensing processes at the environmental agencies and field visits were carried out in these areas to identify planted species. Most restorations involved the planting of exotic species, low species richness and an inadequate proportion of native species, which can be harmful to the conservation and restoration of the Atlantic Forest. Dissemination of these results may alert the environmental agencies in order to avoid the approval of ineffective restorations.

TI  - CHANGES IN THE SOIL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIC MATTER DYNAMICS UNDER DIFFERENT PLANT COVERS
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil properties reported in areas with different management provide useful information about the systems' operation, state of conservation and resilience. In this way, this study evaluated physical properties and organic matter dynamics of soil under different plant covers in seven areas consisting of: five areas under ecological restoration (REC1 to REC5), an areas with native vegetation (MATA) and a sugarcane crop area (SC), all located in State of Mato Grosso do Sul, a transition area between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. Samples were taken at the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers and were analyzed for soil density (Ds), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), total porosity (PT), weighted mean diameter (DMP), aggregate stability index (IEA), and the particle sizes of organic matter. There were no differences in DMP between the areas, however, sugarcane crop area and areas under ecological restoration (REC 1, 3 and 4) had high values of density and microporosity and low contents of the fractions of organic matter, which can promote a greater restriction to the root development of plants. Among the areas under restoration, REC1 and REC5 presented physical conditions with higher similarity to the native vegetation area. Changes in the physical soil properties and parameters such as Total organic carbon (COT), confirmed that the restoration practices applied improved the soil quality.

TI  - Contributions of Leguminosae to young and old stands of neotropical forests under different environmental conditions
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message Potentially nodulating Leguminosae species had high density and biomass in young stands of forests in Northeast Brazil, except in a dry forest on a low-fertility soil. Context Leguminosae species, especially potentially nodulating ones, appear to be important components of tropical secondary forests, although information is still scarce concerning their contributions to richness and biomass under different environmental conditions. Aims To evaluate the contribution of Leguminosae to the aboveground biomass and density of young and old forest stands in six sites, with different climate and soil conditions, in northeastern Brazil. Methods The biomass of plants was estimated using allometric equations in ten plots in one young and one old forest stand in each site. Leguminosae were separated into nodulating and non-nodulating species based on literature. Results Leguminosae, mainly nodulating species, displayed the largest number of species among all families and the largest biomass and density in young stands. There was more similarity in Leguminosae species composition between young and old stands in dry than in humid forests. Conclusion Nodulating species make considerable contributions to the biomass of the initial successional stages of forests in Northeast Brazil - confirming the importance of the family for natural forest regeneration, especially in dry environments.

TI  - Fine-scale effects of bamboo dominance on seed rain in a rainforest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo dominance in tropical forests drives changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure. However, the role of bamboo dominance over ecosystem functions - including those related to forest regeneration - has received less attention. This study evaluated the fine-scale effects of the dominance of native bamboo Guadua weberbaueri Pflg. (Poaceae) on seed rain in a terra-firme forest in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon to understand how bamboos remain a dominant element where they occur. We tested the hypothesis that bamboo dominance (i) reduces seed diversity and biomass and (ii) changes floristic composition and frequencies of seed dispersal mechanisms. For one year, we sampled seeds from seed rain in adjacent bamboo-dominated (BD) and bamboo-free (BF) environments in a forest without major anthropogenic disturbances. We found lower seed species richness in the BD environment and similar seed biomass between BD and BF. In addition, the seed species composition differed between BD and BF, with higher frequency of abiotic mechanisms to seeds dispersal in BD. We conclude that the dominance of bamboos acts as a filter for species that arrive via seed rain, modifying the floristic composition and dispersal mechanisms and, consequently, the dynamics of natural regeneration processes of terra-firme forests in the Amazon. This process can promote the permanence and expansion of the distribution area of bamboos in tropical forests.

TI  - Edge Effects and Seedling Bank Depletion: The Role Played by the Early Successional Palm Attalea oleifera (Arecaceae) in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall occurred over the whole year (3.6 +/- 2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7 +/- 9.2 cm). Finally, adult palm density (21.6 +/- 11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A. oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering by fallen leaves.

TI  - Edge-Related Loss of Tree Phylogenetic Diversity in the Severely Fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest fragmentation are known major causes of nonrandom extinction, but there is no information about their impact on the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining species assemblages. Using a large vegetation dataset from an old hyper-fragmented landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest we assess whether the local extirpation of tree species and functional impoverishment of tree assemblages reduce the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining tree assemblages. We detected a significant loss of tree phylogenetic diversity in forest edges, but not in core areas of small (<80 ha) forest fragments. This was attributed to a reduction of 11% in the average phylogenetic distance between any two randomly chosen individuals from forest edges; an increase of 17% in the average phylogenetic distance to closest non-conspecific relative for each individual in forest edges; and to the potential manifestation of late edge effects in the core areas of small forest remnants. We found no evidence supporting fragmentation-induced phylogenetic clustering or evenness. This could be explained by the low phylogenetic conservatism of key life-history traits corresponding to vulnerable species. Edge effects must be reduced to effectively protect tree phylogenetic diversity in the severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - Ecophysiology and morphology of seed germination and seedling emergence of Combretum lanceolatum Pohl ex Eichler
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combretum lanceolatum Pohl ex Eichler is a widely dominant species of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil. We investigated the ecophysiological and morphological features of seed germination and seedling emergence to explain the establishment success of C. lanceolatum in the field. Hence, seed morphoanatomy and seedling morphology were described. Germination tests were conducted in different substrate types (filter paper and rolled paper towel), temperatures, and light regimes. Normal seedling emergence was also observed in different temperatures by sowing whole fruit in rolled paper towel and seed upon filter paper. Seedling emergence and early growth were evaluated using four substrates under greenhouse conditions: commercial substrate, red soil + sand, sand + vermiculite, and coconut fiber. Overall, C. lanceolatum seed is exalbuminous, showing a narrow ellipsoid tetragonal shape. The embryo is axile type, foliate folded and anatomically bitegmic cotyledons, whose cells display prismatic crystals, phenolic compounds, and store starch. Germination type is cryptocotylar hypogeal. Germination capacity is high (mostly > 80%) irrespective of substrate type, temperature, and light regime, which affected germination speed/time. Despite the broad germination range, normal seedling emergence occurred in fewer temperatures. Whole fruit imposed no impediment for germination producing up to 67% of normal seedlings. Commercial substrate provided the best conditions for seedling emergence/growth under greenhouse conditions. C. lanceolatum seed shows no dormancy, promptly emergenced in a wide range of experimental factors, while its hypogeal seedling protects the cotyledons and contributes to its establishment and wide dominance in the Pantanal wetland. Our results provide ecologically relevant information on regeneration from seed and practical applications for plant propagation to aid restoration initiatives in tropical wetlands.

TI  - The role of government in operationalising markets for REDD plus in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global climate initiative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) initially included carbon markets as one potential policy mechanism to finance a range of forestry projects in developing countries. Indonesia was an early leader on REDD +, and set up the regulatory frameworks and monitoring systems to support demonstration projects that could trade credits in voluntary carbon markets. This article applies a neoliberal govemmentality framework to evaluate the development of REDD + market institutions in Indonesia during the Readiness period between 2008 and 2013. It critiques the role of the state in this process, and how the authority of public agencies shapes the actions of private subjects. The case of Indonesia indicates a pivotal role for government agencies at multiple levels in integrating the operation of FtEDD + market activities within a supportive regime of forest and land management. Critical to this process was legislation to trade in forest carbon and obtain project licenses, devolved land-use planning and forest management that could support conunercial activities, and robust MRV surveillance systems to oversee on-ground activities. Despite these efforts, projects were often subject to an uncertain and highly contested forest management regime, undermining attempts to demonstrate the viability of operationalising market mechanisms at the local scale.

TI  - Species, silvicultural practices and monitoring: forest restoration strategies in protected areas of the Atlantic Forest
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the conduct of new paradigms aimed at ecological restoration, the objective of this work was to review the literature on the application of ecological restoration in protected areas of the Atlantic Forest biome, in order to contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With the use of indexers, focused keywords, and criteria focused on the theme, 58 scientific articles were selected, analyzed through a systematic review and compared with each other in the use of their strategies. The results showed a preference for active restoration with variations in species diversity, and passive restoration. Fertilization, control of competing plants, fighting ants and soil preparation are the most mentioned silvicultural practices. In the analysis of the proposed monitoring, diversity, information intrinsic to the species and the landscape, phytosociology and crown metrics, expressed the most recommended indicators for evaluating the restorative process, and suggest 74 species for use in the projects. In addition, it is necessary to encourage scientific productions on the subject to also include the Midwest and Northeast regions, fauna surveys, as well as a detailed description of the implementation of the ecological restoration project.

TI  - Artificial perches increase bird-mediated seed rain in agricultural fallow area in southern Brazil
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from 12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore, artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of birds in this process.

TI  - Tree-ring formation, radial increment and climate-growth relationship: assessing two potential tree species used in Brazilian Atlantic forest restoration projects
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Key messageThis paper provides an overview of radial growth and tree-ring formation of two tropical tree species used in ecological restoration. It shows that trees growing in natural forests and in plantations have the same diametric growth patterns and climate responses.AbstractUnderstanding the outcomes of ecological restoration projects represents an important step in the conservation of endangered biomes such as the Atlantic forest in Brazil. Tree-ring analysis provides long-term information about the growth dynamics of tree species that can be used to evaluate the potential of different species for restoration projects. To evaluate the potential of using Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Cav.) A. Robyns and Citharexylum myrianthum Cham. in restoration projects in the endangered Atlantic Rain Forest (Reserva Biologica de Poco das AntasRBPA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we verified the seasonality of tree-ring formation to analyze radial growth dynamics and climate-growth relationships of these species. Cambium wounding experiments and direct anatomical analysis of the cambial zone were conducted to assess tree-ring formation periodicity. Tree-ring widths were measured to build tree-ring chronologies and to estimate radial growth rates in natural and planted areas. Both species produced annual tree rings that are produced during the wet season. Tree-ring chronologies of both species have a positive association with rainfall, but each species also responded to rainfall of a specific season. Tree-ring widths of P. grandiflorum were correlated with rainfall at the end of the previous growth season while tree-ring widths of C. myrianthum were correlated with precipitation in the beginning of the growth season. Both species have fast radial growth, but different long-term growth trends. The growth trend for Pseudobombax grandiflorum produces a positive correlation between diameter and age for the trees, while trees of Citharexylum myrianthum have an age-related growth trend and grow faster in the early years. In the present study, we confirm the success of the ecological restoration performed in RBPA as the plantation does not affect the potential growth of the studied species.

TI  - Exotic eucalypts: From demonized trees to allies of tropical forest restoration?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44%-75% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies.

TI  - Flower functional trait responses to restoration time
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions(1) Do species richness, flower functional diversity and redundancy of tree and non-tree species increase with restoration age; (2) are the flower traits of the reference forest similar to those found in restored sites; and (3) does species originality, in terms of unique combinations of different set of flower traits, differ among sites?LocationForests restored by planting a high diversity assemblage of tree species, within the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil.MethodsWe sampled all reproductive individuals (353 species) and classified them in terms of floral type, colour, size, generalization level and openness. As most trees were planted and non-tree species (sub-shrub, shrub, herbs, epiphytes, climbers and hemi-parasitic plants) were mostly naturally established, we analysed them in separate analyses. We compared species richness, functional diversity, redundancy and originality among sites. Moreover, we identified optimal subsets of flower traits to describe vegetation succession trends.Results(1) Flower functional diversity of tree species could be achieved after two decades of restoration, but remained far from reference values for non-tree species. The same gap regarding reference values occurred with species richness, which increased over restoration periods, although were far from the reference values. Redundancy and functional diversity are not related to restoration age. (2) Red/burgundy colour, gullet and bell-funnel shape and large size were identified as indicators of the reference forest flowers. Different indicator traits were found for each restoration sites. (3) Sites were similar regarding originality for tree and for non-tree species.ConclusionA highly diverse species pool seems to promise to increase richness and functional diversity of tree species, but not of non-tree species. Trait analyses have important implications for restoration projects and can be used instead of species taxonomic identity, especially for highly diverse tropical forests. Such functional diversity may be advanced through a priori definition of which species from the regional pool can be used in plantings for forest restoration, with special attention to functional traits of non-tree species. Otherwise, restoration sites in highly fragmented landscapes will not reach functional diversity of reference sites, even after a five-decade period.

TI  - Enabling Factors of NTFP Business Development for Ecosystem Restoration: The Case of Tamanu Oil in Indonesian Degraded Peatland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's tropical peatlands are one of the world's largest carbon sinks, and they are facing the threat of extensive degradation and conversion. The Indonesian government is committed to peat restoration. However, restoration is still a costly, top-down approach lacking community participation, and is focused on the 3R scheme (rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization). Peatland restoration businesses are part of the innovative effort to finance this endeavor. Unfortunately, there is not much information available about the pre-conditions required to create a restoration business. This study seeks to understand the enabling conditions for the development of peatland restoration, with a focus on the tamanu oil business, and to assess whether the same situation might apply in the context of the restoration of degraded peatland. PEST analysis is used to describe the macro-environmental factors of the tamanu oil business and its development opportunities in degraded peatlands. Tamanu oil-based peat ecosystem restoration businesses offer good prospects because of the growing it has grown the bioenergy and biomedical markets, and they can cover a larger area of degraded peatland landscape. For tamanu oil businesses to succeed in peat ecosystem restoration, we recommend that policy documents at various levels include tamanu as a priority commodity for peatland restoration and alternative community businesses, followed by planting programs by all stakeholders. The government and social organizations must take positions as initiators and catalysts, establish a significant number and extent of pilot tamanu plantations, and create a mutually supportive business climate between entrepreneurs and peatland managers.

AB  - Deforestation is one of the largest issues in Indonesian forests. Between 2001 and 2017, South Tapanuli -one of regency in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia-experienced the largest forest loss in 2011. One of the best way to improve the quality of deforested landscape is ecological restoration. In order to get the comprehensive understanding for landscape restoration planning, identifying the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) should be considered. This study aimed to provide a foundation to support new decision-making tools for policymakers to plan the ecological restoration for South Tapanuli. Multi criteria approach combined with participatory planning of local stakeholders were applied for developing criteria. The criteria were selected based on biophysical characters derived from regulations and were converted into boolean map. Then, ESA model was obtained from overlaid of those boolean map which is identified the level of sensitivity area including level 1 (highest), 2, 3, and 4 (lowest). Sensitivity level 1 were dominated in Muara Batang Toru, Batang Toru, Angkola Selatan, and Angkola Sangkunur consisted of 5,340.78 ha (25,14%); 3,129.07 ha (14,73%); 2,911.29 ha (13,7%); and 2,708.51 ha (12,75%), respectively. More than 23% of oil palm in South Tapanuli were identified as being located in the forest zone. We proposed Muara Batang Toru, Angkola Selatan, Angkola Sangkunur, and Batang Toru as the top priority sub-districts for ecological restoration in South Tapanuli Regency. This study reccommends 50,848.85 ha should be managed immediately and full restoration will be proposed at 17,098.06 ha (33.87%).

TI  - The influence of chinese fan palm in the regeneration of the Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest in Serra da Cantareira, SP
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest belongs to Atlantic Forest's domain, an important biodiversity hotspot. In Brazil, most of the invasion reports are related to terrestrial plants, being this forest the most affected. In this context is the Cantareira State Park (PEC), Sao Paulo. The PEC is home to a remnant that has a focus of invasion by several plant species, including Livistona chinensis (N.J. Jacquin) R. Brown ex Mart., known as Chinese Fan Palm. Given the potential for invasion of this species, a floristic-phytosociological study was conducted in order to analyse a possible inhibition effect in the natural regeneration process of the arboreous component caused by juveniles individuals of Livistona chinensis, with heights varying between 3 and 6 m. For each palm were installed 8 plots of 1 x 1 m, placed in quadrants, with the palm's stipe in the center, in a way that half of the plots were placed under the canopy and half around the palm. In the analysis were considered arboreal and palms specimens >= 20 cm in height and with a Perimeter at Breast Height (PAP) <= 15 cm. The results pointed to a drastic reduced number of seedlings and saplings (28.95% and 29.85%) and of the species richness (16.13% and 8.33% of species) occurring under the canopies of these exotic palm trees in comparison with the surroundings (71.05% and 70.15% of the sampled individuals; and 61.29% and 58.33% of species, respectively). The study has shown the inhibiting effect of young individuals of this species on the forest regeneration in the PEC, by substantially reducing the richness of species and the abundance of arboreal individuals under the projection of their canopies, possibly because they serve as a shield and cause excessive shading of the place.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of Brazilian livestock production through optimized pasture restoration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program ("Programa ABC"). The model estimates El using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$.ha(-1).yr(-1)) to around 300R$.ha(-1).yr(-1), respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated El of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO(2)e/kg ONE) relative to 3.59 kg CO(2)e/kg CWE for optimized management Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EL The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAL (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Floodplain forests drive fruit- eating fish diversity at the Amazon Basin-scale.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike most rivers globally, nearly all lowland Amazonian rivers have unregulated flow, supporting seasonally flooded floodplain forests. Floodplain forests harbor a unique tree species assemblage adapted to flooding and specialized fauna, including fruit-eating fish that migrate seasonally into floodplains, favoring expansive floodplain areas. Frugivorous fish are forest-dependent fauna critical to forest regeneration via seed dispersal and support commercial and artisanal fisheries. We implemented linear mixed effects models to investigate drivers of species richness among specialized frugivorous fishes across the [approximately]6,000,000 km2 Amazon Basin, analyzing 29 species from 9 families (10,058 occurrences). Floodplain predictors per subbasin included floodplain forest extent, tree species richness (309,540 occurrences for 2,506 species), water biogeochemistry, flood duration, and elevation, with river order controlling for longitudinal positioning along the river network. We observed heterogeneous patterns of frugivorous fish species richness, which were positively correlated with floodplain forest extent, tree species richness, and flood duration. The natural hydrological regime facilitates fish access to flooded forests and controls fruit production. Thus, the ability of Amazonian floodplain ecosystems to support frugivorous fish assemblages hinges on extensive and diverse seasonally flooded forests. Given the low functional redundancy in fish seed dispersal networks, diverse frugivorous fish assemblages disperse and maintain diverse forests; vice versa, diverse forests maintain more fish species, underscoring the critically important taxonomic interdependencies that embody Amazonian ecosystems. Effective management strategies must acknowledge that access to diverse and hydrologically functional floodplain forests is essential to ensure the long-term survival of frugivorous fish and, in turn, the long-term sustainability of floodplain forests.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating tropical forest carbon stocks: making REDD a reality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries is of central importance in efforts to combat climate change. Key scientific challenges must be addressed to prevent any policy roadblocks. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations' carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage. Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.

TI  - Atlantic Forest Ecosystems: Are There Significant Differences When Compared at the Same Stage of Regeneration?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the monitoring and assessment of Atlantic Forest ecosystems, key indicators of the regeneration stage are considered. However, the current classification of these stages by experts does not consider the possible differences among such ecosystems. In order to test the hypothesis of significant differences, Atlantic Forest ecosystems in southern Brazil were compared at the same stage (initial, medium, and advanced stages of regeneration). An extensive database of the floristic forest inventory of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, with 460 sampling units, was used, addressing the seasonal deciduous forest (SDF), dense ombrophilous forest (DOF), and mixed ombrophilous forest (MOF). The regeneration stage of each sample unit was previously classified by experts using five key indicators (basal area per hectare-BA/ha; number of individuals per hectare-N/ha; number of species-S; Shannon biodiversity index-H'; and diameter at breast height-DBH). The Kruskal-Wallis method and pairwise multiple comparisons based on Dunn's procedure were applied, considering two-way tests with 5% significance, and 95% power. The statistical tests confirmed the research hypothesis, namely, that the key indicators had significant differences in the later regeneration stages of Atlantic Forest ecosystems. For instance, S in DOF was statistically higher (p < 0.001) than in MOF and SDF (44 +/- 9); N in SDF was significantly lower (394 +/- 248 at mid-stage) compared to MOF (475 +/- 233) and DOF (545 +/- 173); and H' showed increasing differences towards more advanced stages. Considering that the stage of forest regeneration is the main criterion for decision-making between suppression and conservation of forest ecosystems, the results achieved should support the review of current procedures applied to the classification of successional stages. Given the demonstrated differences, in the next steps of research, we will evaluate and propose specific standards for each Atlantic Forest ecosystem, i.e., intervals of discriminating values for the key indicators applicable to this biome.

Thus, patient safety culture is increasingly being explored as a guide for quality improvement efforts.DesignA qualitative approach.MethodsParticipatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration were adapted in this study. This study used focus groups, then subsequent nurse-led photo-narrated walkabouts, and photo elicitation with 23 nurses and one physician in interactive phases of data collection and analysis over an eight-month timeframe.ResultsThe core themes identified were: the medication system shapes patient safety' and the feeling of helplessness in the face of the prevailing organization culture'. Participants discussed supports exiting in the intensive care unit that shape medication safety, the barriers that impede safe medication management, the solutions to improve medication safety and the creation of a better medication safety culture.ConclusionsThe methods used allowed participants to visualise sound practices as well as key safety issues, reflect on their day-to-day work, re-think potential improvements, and enact changes to improve medication safety and medication safety culture. However, the patient safety culture is also marked by administrative pressure. The hospital needs to adopt participatory management, where the health professionals can act together with the organisational leaders to promote a just culture.Relevance to clinical practiceThe participatory photographic research methods from the field of ecological restoration provided participants with a tool to promote patient safety culture and engage policy change dialogue. However, it will be important in future restorative research to track-specific safety outcomes over time to assess the cost-benefit of the adoption of participatory management models.

T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the accumulated litter at a forest restoration (FR) for 23 years with a primary Tropical Rain Forest (FP). Thirty permanent plots of 3 x 3 m were placed in each area. In the center of each plot the litter (0,50 x 0,50 x 0,05 m) was collected. The material was dried at 70 degrees C for 48 hours and the dry mass was measured. The matrix of Pearson correlation between the values of accumulated litter and environmental variables plant area index (PAI), soil compaction and density of shrub and tree individuals of natural regeneration layer were calculated. The mean values found (FR = 3,177 +/- 937 kg. ha(-1); FP = 4,411 +/- 1,389 kg. ha(-1)) of accumulated litter showed significant difference between the two study areas (p < 0.001). The accumulated litter showed significant correlation (p < 0.001) with soil compaction and plant area index.

TI  - Impact of seedling removal on regenerating community structure of a seasonal semideciduous forest
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Impact of seedling removal on regenerating community structure of a seasonal semideciduous forest). Transplanting seedlings and saplings from natural forests has been considered an alternative to producing saplings of native species for forest restoration purposes, but the possible impact of this procedure on plant community regeneration has not been investigated. This work evaluates the impact of different treatments of shrub and tree-seedling (up to 30 cm) removal from a seasonal semideciduous forest fragment located in southeastern Brazil on the natural regeneration process. Eighty 2x2 m plots were installed in two habitats (forest edge and interior) and submitted to four seedling-removal treatments (I, II - 100% removal with or without soil mixing; III - 50% removal without soil mixing: and IV - control treatment Without seedling removal). Regeneration density and richness were evaluated before treatment as well as 6, 12 and 18 months later. The results were compared among treatments for each evaluation period and among periods within treatments. There were similarities between edge and interior. The natural regeneration process did not improve with soil mixing. Plots submitted to seedling removal partially recovered plant density; however, these plots had lower species richness when compared to the control and to the initial values before treatment. Seedling removal has a negative impact on the regeneration process of low-density species, thus the use of natural regeneration as a sapling source for forest restoration purposes should focus only on high-density species with well-known regeneration strategies and not on the community as a whole.

TI  - Water availability determines the richness and density of fig trees within Brazilian semideciduous forest landscapes
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of fig trees in tropical ecosystems is evidenced by the great diversity (+750 species) and wide geographic distribution of the genus. We assessed the contribution of environmental variables on the species richness and density of fig trees in fragments of seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) in Brazil. We assessed 20 forest fragments in three regions in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Fig tree richness and density was estimated in rectangular plots, comprising 31.4 ha sampled. Both richness and fig tree density were linearly modeled as function of variables representing (1) fragment metrics, (2) forest structure, and (3) landscape metrics expressing water drainage in the fragments. Model selection was performed by comparing the AIC values (Akaike Information Criterion) and the relative weight of each model (wAIC). Both species richness and fig tree density were better explained by the water availability in the fragment (meter of streams/ha): wAIC(richness) = 0.45, wAIC(density) = 0.96. The remaining variables related to anthropic perturbation and forest structure were of little weight in the models. The rainfall seasonality in SSF seems to select for both establishment strategies and morphological adaptations in the hemiepiphytic fig tree species. In the studied SSF, hemiepiphytes established at lower heights in their host trees than reported for fig trees in evergreen rainforests. Some hemiepiphytic fig species evolved superficial roots extending up to 100 m from their trunks, resulting in hectare-scale root zones that allow them to efficiently forage water and soil nutrients. The community of fig trees was robust to variation in forest structure and conservation level of SSF fragments, making this group of plants an important element for the functioning of seasonal tropical forests.

TI  - Artificial Perches: Ecological and Functional Aspects of its Contribution in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration through conventional plantation techniques can create forests with low biodiversity. As such, one way to overcome possible shortcomings of the restoration process is to use nucleation techniques, such as artificial perches. These structures attract the avifauna and increase the deposition of seeds associated with feces or bird regurgitation. Seed rain and seedlings regeneration were monitored under artificial perches and control areas in a degraded area of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. In this study, 46 morphospecies of seeds were identified. Under the perches, greater abundance and richness of seeds were found with certain ecological and functional traits that support the role of artificial perches as a biological diversity core. Seedling establishment was low under the perches and control areas. This suggests that integrated actions to improve soil conditions should be applied to enhance seedling establishment.

TI  - Structure and composition of altered riparian forests in an agricultural Amazonian landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation influence the microclimate, vegetation structure, and composition of remaining patches of tropical forest. In the southern Amazon, at the frontier of cropland expansion, forests are converted and fragmented in a pattern that leaves standing riparian forests whose dimensions are mandated by the Brazilian National Forest Code. These altered riparian forests share many characteristics of well-studied upland forest fragments, but differ because they remain connected to larger areas of forest downstream, and because they may experience wetter soil conditions because reduction of forest cover in the surrounding watershed raises groundwater levels and increases stream runoff. We compared forest regeneration, structure, composition, and diversity in four areas of intact riparian forest and four areas each of narrow, medium, and wide altered riparian forests that have been surrounded by agriculture since the early 1980s. We found that seedling abundance was reduced by as much as 64% and sapling abundance was reduced by as much as 67% in altered compared to intact riparian forests. The most pronounced differences between altered and intact forest occurred near forest edges and within the narrowest sections of altered riparian forests. Woody plant species composition differed and diversity was reduced in altered forests compared to intact riparian forests. However, despite being fragmented for several decades, large woody plant biomass and carbon storage, the number of live or dead large woody plants, mortality rates, and the size distribution of woody plants did not differ significantly between altered and intact riparian forests. Thus, even in these relatively narrow forests with high edge : area ratios, we saw no evidence of the increases in mortality and declines in biomass that have been found in other tropical forest fragment studies. However, because of the changes in both species community and reduced regeneration, it is unclear how long this relative lack of change will be sustained. Additionally, Brazil recently passed a law in their National Forest Code allowing narrower riparian buffers than those studied here in restored areas, which could affect their long-term sustainability.

TI  - Impact of exotic tree species on the natural regeneration of an urban restinga forest
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message Exotic tree species Syzygium cumini and Taliparti tiliaceum affect restinga forest regeneration growing under them, in comparison to native species, mainly because they reduce saplings' abundance.Biological plant invasions are a considerable threat to native vegetation biodiversity, mainly when the invaded site consists in suppressed fragmented remnants surrounded by urbanization. Although this is the case of Brazilian restinga forests, knowledge on potential invasion events in these environments remains scarce. We herein identified differences between these communities by comparing natural regeneration on plots planted with exotic tree species Syzygium cumini and Talipariti tiliaceum to those planted with native trees on an urban restinga forest park in Rio de Janeiro city. We observed that natural regeneration communities were impacted by exotic trees, resulting in alterations to both their structure and floristic composition. Furthermore, the magnitude of this impact depended on the identity of the exotic tree in question. Somehow, plant community regeneration based on species T. tiliaceum was significantly different from that in native plots, at all parameters: species richness, mean abundance of individuals, mean plant height, total basal area, absolute density and abundance of seedlings. S. cumini, in its turn, seemed to have only significantly changed regeneration's abundance parameters. Therefore, based on our findings, S. cumini and T. tiliaceum presented potential invasive impact to native flora. These species should be monitored and likely managed in other restinga forests, since prevention is the key action to preserve our native environments from biological invasions.

TI  - Resource heterogeneity moderates the biodiversity-function relationship in real world ecosystems
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous recent studies have tested the effects of plant, pollinator, and predator diversity on primary productivity, pollination, and consumption, respectively. Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems.

TI  - Limits of Brazil's Forest Code as a means to end illegal deforestation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2012 Brazilian Forest Code governs the fate of forests and savannas on Brazil's 394 Mha of privately owned lands. The government claims that a new national land registry (SICAR), introduced under the revised law, could end illegal deforestation by greatly reducing the cost of monitoring, enforcement, and compliance. This study evaluates that potential, using data from state-level land registries (CAR) in Para and Mato Grosso that were precursors of SICAR. Using geospatial analyses and stakeholder interviews, we quantify the impact of CAR on deforestation and forest restoration, investigating how landowners adjust their behaviors over time. Our results indicate rapid adoption of CAR, with registered properties covering a total of 57 Mha by 2013. This suggests that the financial incentives to join CAR currently exceed the costs. Registered properties initially showed lower deforestation rates than unregistered ones, but these differences varied by property size and diminished over time. Moreover, only 6% of registered producers reported taking steps to restore illegally cleared areas on their properties. Our results suggest that, fromthe landowner's perspective, full compliance with the Forest Code offers few economic benefits. Achieving zero illegal deforestation in this context would require the private sector to include full compliance as a market criterion, while state and federal governments develop SICAR as a de facto enforcement mechanism. These results are relevant to other tropical countries and underscore the importance of developing a policy mix that creates lasting incentives for sustainable land-use practices.

TI  - Testing for priority effects of tree plantings on natural regeneration in restoration sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsOur study aims to understand whether priority effects or environmental filters drive community assembly in 20-year-old restoration areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this, we investigated the following questions: (i) does the initial composition of planted communities (distinct combination of ecological groups) affect the natural regeneration regarding functional composition (mean trait values), diversity (functional and taxonomic), and vegetation structure? (ii) Which functional traits of the planted community have the potential to promote or constrain natural regeneration?LocationThe study was carried out in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, located in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in a stand of 2.16 hectares with an experimental restoration design established in the year 2000 to test tree species performance of different ecological groups.MethodsIn 2020, we sampled trees with a diameter at breast height greater than 2.5 cm in 20 m x 20 m plots with four replicates per treatment and measured leaf, wood, and seed functional traits. Then, we estimated the diversity (functional and taxonomic richness), functional composition, and vegetation structure of natural regeneration, compared them between treatments, and tested which traits of the planted community influenced them.ResultsNatural regeneration exhibited significant differences between treatments, particularly regarding the diversity dimension (functional and taxonomic) and vegetation structure (basal area and abundance). Wood density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of the planted species were associated with natural regeneration (functional composition, diversity, and vegetation structure).ConclusionsPriority effects in conservative tree planting communities affect natural regeneration, while functional convergence observed in acquisitive planting communities suggests the role of environmental filtering. Communities with low wood density, low C:N ratio, and high specific leaf area, which characterize an acquisitive resource-use strategy, exhibited higher functional and taxonomic diversity of natural regeneration, leading to the desired trajectory in ecological restoration.Our study investigated the community assembly in a 20-year-old Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration area. Different tree planting arrangements affected natural regeneration in its diversity and structure. Wood density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of the planted species influenced natural regeneration, suggesting priority effects favoring certain resource-use strategies. Environmental filtering has a stronger effect on natural regeneration when the priority effect of competition is weak.image

TI  - Variability and genetic structure in fragments of Eugenia involucrata De Candolle established through microsatellite markers
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Eugenia involucrata DC. is a forest species with high environmental and economic potential. The objective of this study was to quantify the genetic variability and analyzed the genetic structure of three natural fragments located in the central region of the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We used four microsatellite loci developed for the congener species Eugenia uniflora and using GenAlEx 6.5 software, parameters of genetic variability and its partition among and within fragments were estimated for each locus. We observed high levels of genetic variability (3.67 alleles per locus; H-O = 0.815; H-E = 0.625; F-IS = -0.294), most of which (93%) were distributed within the fragments, suggesting that these individuals came from a single original population. Gene flow between fragments was high (2.35 to 4.56 migrants per generation), resulting in low genetic differentiation indexes (F-ST values ranging from 0.052 to 0.096). The fragments showed high genetic variability, distributed within the remnants themselves, and low genetic differentiation. Our results have repercussions for planning locally adapted germplasm collections for forest restoration programs, thereby avoiding the implantation of populations with an exogamous depression.

In this paper, we investigate the ability of forest restoration to produce tree populations with high genetic diversity in previously deforested areas. We used nine SSR markers to genotype populations of two forest restorations and two areas of natural remnants. There were no significant differences between natural forest remnants and restored forests with respect to inbreeding levels (f = 0.20) or genetic diversity, as assessed by levels of heterozygosity (H-s similar to 0.31-0.43) and allelic richness (2.41-2.94). Instead, we found evidence of gene flow from neighbouring woods to restored forests. Although some populations may show a lower number of private alleles, this would be an expected result of a bottleneck effect in reduced populations such as those in forest restorations. Although the loss of these low frequency alleles has no major consequences for genetic diversity, the impact on population fitness in a scenario of environmental change is unpredictable.

TI  - Are liming and pit size determining for tree species establishment in degraded areas by kaolin mining?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining contributes to the global economy on different scales and plays a fundamental role in the development of the goods and services sectors. However, the negative impacts caused by the activity are unavoidable, as they intensely degrade soil structures and modify landscapes. The use of native tree species has been effective in restoring the structure and functions of post-mining ecosystems in the Amazon. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate chemical indicators of soil quality, survival and initial growth of six tree species planted in degraded ecosystem by kaolin mining under the effects of liming in three pit volumes in the Eastern Amazon. The initial conditions indicated highly degraded soil, with acidic pH, low content of OM, P and K. Liming significantly reduced the level of toxic Al in the soil and provided Ca and Mg for the plants. Through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we found that the two first components explained 69.30% of the variance of 13 functional indicators of soil quality. PC1 was positively correlated with Ca, Mg, K, SB, CEC and V% and negatively correlated with H+Al and Al saturation. Survival was higher than 80% for Clitoria fairchildiana in all treatments. Liming and pit volume were determining in growth, with high growth rates in height of Inga edulis, Inga cayennensis, Clitoria fairchildiana and Tachigali vulgaris. The species used in this study presented good initial development in restoring ecosystems after kaolin mining.

TI  - Factors affecting savanna and forest regeneration in pastures across the cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado region comprises the world's most biodiverse savanna and the largest cultivated pastures for cattle in Brazil. Forty percent of these pastures are unproductive or degraded, with bare soil and native vegetation increasingly replacing exotic forage grasses. This study sought to investigate the regeneration of native vege-tation in the pastures of the Cerrado and to evaluate the contribution of biophysical, land management, and landscape attributes to this process. Across the Cerrado, we analyzed pasture plant communities and the attri-butes of pasture management intensification, fire events, landscape native vegetation cover, and climate and soil types of 93 active pastures and 15 abandoned pastures. For the abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was an additional variable. On actively cultivated pastures, savanna regeneration varied from 0 to 70%, with a di-versity of herbs and woody species. Pasture management was the main predictor of savanna regeneration on cultivated pastures. On abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was the main predictor. Exotic grass cover had a strong negative relationship with savanna regeneration and they were present even in pastures abandoned for 44 years. Our study reveals the potential of natural regeneration of the Cerrado and its particular predictors. The occurrence of pastures with high natural regeneration indicates that national policies can promote native vegetation restoration and silvopastoral systems with predictable, low cost implementation.

T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the native forest cover in the Guandu River hydrographic basin (GRHB) between the years 1985 and 2020, using landscape ecology metrics.Methodology: The land cover and land use values from the MapBiomas project in the years 1985 and 2020 were used. The native forest fragments were classified according to their size, as C1 (< 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.1-50 ha), and C4 (> 50 ha). Landscape ecology metrics were calculated using the V-Late 2.0 extension in ArcGIS (R).Originality/Relevance: Study of the temporal dynamics of forest cover of hydrographic basins is essential to define strategic forest conservation and restoration actions aimed at protecting water resources.Results: The native forest cover of the GRHB increased by approximately 12%, with an increase in the number and average area of fragments. In general, the forest remnants became closer to each other and demonstrated a higher edge density. A high number of small fragments (< 5 ha) was verified and the largest fragments (> 50 ha) were the main factor responsible for the expansion of the native forest cover in the basin.Social/management contributions: Forest restoration actions in the GRHB should prioritize the connectivity of smaller fragments. In addition to supporting forest restoration projects, the results contribute to the application of methodologies to implement water resource management instruments, helping to define practices and policies for sustainable water use.

TI  - Monitoring canopy bird activity in disturbed landscapes with automatic recorders: A case study in the tropics
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration. To implement appropriate conservation programs, it appears necessary to monitor seed dispersers and to estimate their response to local changes. Here, we used non-invasive ecoacoustic methods to monitor the activity of a canopy bird, the White-throated toucan, Ramphastos tucanus, a major seed disperser and flagship species of the Amazonian forest. We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus. This method, which can easily be repeated with limited human expertise, detected 1748 recordings with R. tucanus vocalizations. A GLMM analysis was applied to test for a possible effect of habitat type and human activity, while accounting for time of the day and rainfall. The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.

TI  - Monitoring of areas in conflict with the Legislation for the Protection of Native Vegetation in Brazil: opportunity for large-scale forest restoration and for the Brazilian global agenda
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration, combined with the mitigation of climate change, has attracted significant interest from several stakeholders. This can aid in restoring degraded areas and enhancing carbon storage. Brazil's global environmental commitments, particularly in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), require substantial financial investments to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Minas Gerais has extensive areas protected by the Legislation for the Protection of Native Vegetation (LPVN) that are not compliant and must be restored in the next 20 years. Geographic data was collected from the government SICAR database. Land use in MG was analyzed using geoprocessing techniques using data from the MapBiomas platform to estimate the area in conflict with LPVN regulations. Minas Gerais has an environmental liability of 3.7 million hectares (Mha) that need restoration in the next 20 years. The Legal Reserve (RL) (2.2 Mha) and Permanent Preservation Areas of watercourses (1.3 Mha) are the most non-compliant protected areas. The "Tri & acirc;ngulo Mineiro" and "Norte de Minas" mesoregions have the largest areas in conflict with the LPVN. The Cerrado faces a more critical situation, with approximately 56% of the conflicting areas located there. This study outlines the extent of restoration needed with native vegetation to comply with LPVN requirements in MG.

TI  - Graminoid-led natural regeneration of dry savannas after severe degradation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the natural regeneration of vegetation after degradation is necessary to evaluate the passive restoration method, and is important to support active restoration. Little is known about plant community as-sembly in savannas that lost their resprouting ability, such as in mined or intensified agriculture and silviculture areas. We analyzed the life form cover, graminoids community composition, and the regeneration traits of in-dicator species in degraded and conserved areas in the Brazilian savanna. We sampled the vegetation cover, and investigated the regeneration traits by analyzing seed mass and production, resprouting structures/vegetative reproduction, and life cycle. Colonization in degraded areas occurred especially by graminoids, which contrib-uted >75% in terms of cover in areas degraded by eucalyptus plantation, and 37% in areas degraded by mining. Subshrubs, shrubs, and vines contributed at lower proportions to vegetation cover, and trees showed the lowest colonization. The graminoid communities presented different species composition across land types. Indicator species of severely degraded areas had high production of light seeds and no underground resprouting structures (Aristida setifolia and Aristida glaziovii). Indicator species of conserved and less degraded areas had moderate production of intermediate-mass seeds and basal rhizomes, Mesosetum loliiforme. Indicator species of conserved areas had low production of heavy seeds and basal rhizomes, Trachypogon spicatus. Such variety of niches can be used as a tool for the ecological restoration of the Cerrado, by consorting species with different responses to degradation and functions to restoration.

TI  - The role of agroforestry in restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest: Opportunities and challenges for smallholder farmers
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Restoring the degraded Atlantic Forest is one of the biggest conservation challenges in Brazil. In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies.2. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema.3. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products. Our results show lack of policy support and initial investment needs are the biggest constraints to agroforestry, but opportunity cost is not considered a large barrier.4. Tailored policies and financial measures are needed to integrate thousands of smallholder farmers into the Atlantic Forest restoration agenda, helping to reach biome restoration targets while supporting rural livelihoods and national food security. Further research is required into links between additional socio-economic and biogeographical variables and agroforestry uptake in the region.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF BIRDLIFE IN DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION METHODS WITH EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL PERCHES.
T2  - Revista de Biologia Neotropical
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial perches provide complexity to the landscape, a factor that can increase animal biodiversity. We tested the hypothesis that artificial perches used in ecological restoration promote increased birdlife diversity in a restored landscape in southern Brazil. The study was conducted in the southwest of Parana State, on land used for years for agriculture and pasture. Estimates of species and diversity of avifauna in 12 experimental plots were obtained one year after the beginning of the restoration. Data from plots restored through nucleation, which consisted of inserting artificial perches, were used to create a data set analyzed with and without the records of birds obtained exclusively on artificial perches. These data were compared with those from experimental plots re-vegetated by either passive or active (i.e. high diversity planting) restoration. In addition, the ability of different restoration techniques to attract avifauna occurring in a nearby forest was investigated. Restored plots using nucleation had higher richness (42[plus or minus] 3.00SD species), abundance and diversity compared to passive restoration and high diversity planting. However, when the results obtained exclusively from artificial perches were disregarded, the pattern of the diversity components in the nucleation did not differ from that of the passive restoration. Thus, the artificial perches provided an additional niche and, in this study, represented 34% of the increase in the accumulated richness observed in nucleation. Thus, perches are an important natural engineering structure that can increase local bird richness.

TI  - Cluster planting facilitates survival but not growth in early development of restored tropical forest
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interspecific interactions are considered to be important structuring forces in early successional vegetation. Whereas competition seems to prevail in less severe environments, facilitation tends to increase in importance in harsh environments. Hence, facilitation is expected to play an important role in degraded tropical areas with high irradiance, heat loads, and evapotranspiration, where conditions are far from optimum for most forest species. We planned a restoration project on the southeastern Brazilian coastal plain to compare growth and survival of tree seedlings planted at two densities (isolated or aggregated) in a factorial experiment with nutrient addition, We monitored survival, height, ground level diameter, and crown projection of 4132 saplings from 19 species that ranged along a successional gradient, over an 18-month period. We used mixed-effect models to analyze the relationship between species performance and treatments, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the models, The best, model showed higher survival in aggregated plantations (indicating facilitation) for non-pioneer (slower growing) species, In contrast, we found lower diameter growth in aggregated plantation (indicating competition), Fertilizer addition did not affect survival in clusters, but, surprisingly, it had a negative effect on isolated plants of both pioneer and non-pioneer species. Fertilizer addition had a positive effect on diameter and crown projection growth in aggregated plantations (reducing competition), especially for pioneer species. Thus, whether facilitation or competition was the predominant interaction depended on the effect analyzed. As establishment of non-pioneer species in disturbed sites can be challenging, restoration designs could take advantage of higher survival rates in clusters and use resource addition to ameliorate growth and decrease competition for limited resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the potential frugivory and seed dispersal by birds in Casearia sylvestris, aiming to provide information about its ecology as well as subsidies for the species use in restoration projects of degraded areas. In 22 hours of focal observations in an individual located in a mixed reforestation in Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were recorded 17 bird species, distributed in five families, consuming a total of 118 fruits during 206 feeding bouts to the plant. The species of omnivorous birds (82,4%, n = 14) consumed 84,5% of fruits, while insectivorous (17.6%, n = 3) consumed 15,5% of fruits. More than a half of the fruit removals (55.3%) were realized in reaching position and 32.5% in hovering position, because of the difficulty of bird sustaining on the branches, which are quite flexible. There was potential dispersion in 87.4% of the consumed fruits. The species C. sylvestris is highly recommended to forest recovery projects, because showed a great potential of seed dispersal and attracted a lot of birds during the dry season, when food resources are scarce in the tropics.

TI  - Biodiversity responses to restoration across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is focussing attention and resources on restoration globally. Nowhere is this more crucial than in tropical forests that harbor immense biodiversity, but have also undergone widespread defores-tation over the past few decades. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate how biodiversity features respond to for -est restoration across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world. We assembled biodiversity in different metrics of structure and diversity features of three taxonomic groups (vascular plants, soil microorganisms, and invertebrates), generating a dataset with 2370 observations from 76 primary studies. We quantified the incomplete recovery of biodiversity (i.e., the rate of recovery to a pre-disturbance state) occurring during the restoration process, which we called the 'recovery gap'. Our results revealed that forests undergoing resto-ration in the BAF show a recovery gap of 34% for structure features and 22% for diversity features in comparison to reference reforests, considering all taxonomic groups investigated. For vascular plants, soil microorganisms, andinvertebrates the recovery gap ranged between 46 and 47%, 16-26%, and 4-7%, respectively. Overall, the recovery gap was influenced by the interaction of restoration actions (i.e., the past land use, restoration age and restoration approach - active and passive restoration), however, structure features responded more sensitively to the time elapsed since restoration started, while the recovery gap for diversity features depended more on the past land-use. Our study can help guide the prioritization of the aforenamed taxonomic groups in restoration, the regulation of potential biodiversity offsetting policies in the BAF, and understanding how coupled biodiversity features respond to the interaction of environmental conditions and restoration actions in a high fragmented tropical landscape.

TI  - The Nature of Seedling Assemblages in a Fragmented Tropical Landscape: Implications for Forest Regeneration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether aging forest fragments are able to recover original assemblages or progressively move toward impoverished successional stages remains as an open question. This study tested the hypothesis that seedling assemblages in forest fragments differ from those across mature forest stands and examined to what extent the uncovered patterns supported the notion that edge-affected habitats tend to support impoverished tree assemblages dominated by pioneer species. We contrasted a series of small forest remnants (391ha) to old-growth stands located in the largest (ca 3500ha) and best preserved forest remnant in northeastern Brazil and found that tree seedling assemblages inhabiting forest fragments exhibited reduced species richness (up to 50%) at different spatial scales in comparison to seedling assemblages in mature forest and adult assemblages in both fragments and mature forest stands. Moreover, ordination analyses clearly segregated fragment seedling assemblages in taxonomic/functional terms and segregation correlated to the richness of pioneer species. Seedlings of pioneer species and those bearing medium-sized seeds (0.61.5cm) increased in fragments, whereas large-seeded species (1.53.0cm) were reduced by more than a half. Such a multiple-scale replacement of the old-growth flora by pioneers was also confirmed by an indicator species analysis and the resulting pioneer indicator species. Our results suggest that small forest fragments support impoverished and distorted seedling assemblages. This floristic/functional drift implies that forest remnants or edge-affected habitats tend to be dominated by a small set of pioneer tree species rather than supporting a substantial portion of the old-growth flora as do mature forest stands.

TI  - Forest fragmentation in the Sao Francisco River Hydrographic Basin, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of forest cover in the Sao Francisco River Basin (BHRSF) can be assessed by metrics of landscape ecology. The aim of this work was to evaluate the forest fragmentation of the Sao Francisco River Basin, Brazil, through metrics of landscape ecology, and the quantification of forest cover in federal conservation units (UCs) for the Caatinga, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes in the years 1997, 2007 and 2017. The mapping of forest fragments was calculated by the area and the quantity of forest fragments that were divided into the size classes: (1) small (up to 10 ha); (2) medium (between 10 and 100 ha); and (3) large (greater than 100 ha). The metrics were calculated in the Fragstats (R) 4.2 software, and three groups of metrics were used: area, shape and border. The metric fragment numbers (NP), class area (CA), average fragment size (MPS) and edge density (ED) of forest fragments from the Caatinga and Cerrado biomes at BHRSF prove that the Basin is in the process of forest fragmentation mainly in the large fragments, which had their areas reduced, and in those of medium size, which had an increase in the amount of edges. In general, the protection of forest areas in the Caatinga and Cerrado UCs is not effective in maintaining the forest cover, given the deforestation that has existed in these protected areas in the last 20 years. Measures such as payments for environmental services or forest restoration must be used by the government and society in conjunction with the creation and maintenance of protected forest areas. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome to show an increase in the forest cover and a decrease in the forest fragmentation at BHRSF. Initiatives such as the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact and the 2006 Atlantic Forest Law may have favored this increase in the forest cover.

TI  - Mining Tailings Effects on Soil Quality and Performance of Two Native Species of Atlantic Forest: Implications for Restoration
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities significantly contribute to environmental pollution by releasing chemical contaminants into ecosystems, making natural recovery challenging. In this study, we amended the mining tailings from the Fund & atilde;o dam with reference soil to simulate the heterogeneity of tailings concentrations to which native species are exposed. We aimed to identify the tailings concentration that best supports the development of two native species, Deguelia costata and Peltophorum dubium. Our results showed that substrates with lower concentration of tailings had an increase in organic matter content and higher acidity. In contrast, substrates with higher tailings concentration showed increased levels of toxic metals; yet these metals seemed not to be readily available to plants, as evidenced by the enhanced biomass accumulation and improved seedling quality in these subtracts. Conversely, the reference soil, being nutritionally deficient and acidic, may have led to increased absorption of toxic metals by the plants. This resulted in reduced growth and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes and synthesis of flavonoids. Both species selectively accumulated iron in the roots and manganese in the leaves, without reaching phytotoxic levels. The findings unequivocally demonstrate that D. costata and P. dubium exhibited remarkable resilience by successfully thriving and growing in highly contaminated substrates (up to 100% mining tailings). Hence, both D. costata and P. dubium prove to be highly suitable candidates for the restoration of areas devastated by iron mining activities.

TI  - Eucalyptus productive matrix influences the soil seed bank in southern Brazil
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus species are cultivated for various purposes around the world, mainly because they adapt well and grow quickly. These productive matrices of planted forests are common in Brazil, added to which, areas of native vegetation are requirements of environmental legislation. Although eucalyptus plantations are widely distributed in Brazil, little is known about the soil seed bank (SSB) in the eucalyptus productive matrix (EPM). We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6 months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness, composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence, species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants. These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support actions in ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Biodiversity, threats and conservation challenges in the Cerrado of Amapa, an Amazonian savanna
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - An Amazonian savanna in northern Brazil known as the Cerrado of Amapa is under imminent threat from poor land-use planning, the expansion of large-scale agriculture and other anthropogenic pressures. These savannas house a rich and unique flora and fauna, including endemic plants and animals. However, the area remains under-sampled for most taxa, and better sampling may uncover new species. We estimate that only similar to 9.16% of these habitats have any kind of protection, and legislative changes threaten to further weaken or remove this protection. Here we present the status of knowledge concerning the biodiversity of the Cerrado of Amapa, its conservation status, and the main threats to the conservation of this Amazonian savanna. To secure the future of these unique and imperilled habitats, we suggest urgent expansion of protected areas, as well as measures that would promote less-damaging land uses to support the local population.

TI  - Assessing forest restoration effectiveness in the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion using epigaeic ant assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant initiated a large reforestation programme after the expropriation of the areas destined for the formation of the reservoir. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration of the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest ecoregion, Brazil, using epigaeic ant assemblages as bioindicators, by comparing ant species richness and composition in the Reservoir Protection Strip with adjacent areas, such as the primary forest of the Iguacu National Park and the Permanent Preservation Area located on a rural property and agricultural areas. In total, 171 ant species were identified. Ant species richness was higher in forest than in agricultural areas and did not differ among forest areas. However, ant species composition in forest areas, regardless of the restoration technique used, was not similar to the primary forest, possibly due to variation in forest recovery time. This study highlights the great value of the Iguacu National Park as a conservation unit. Also, it reveals that the efforts for the creation and maintenance of the Reservoir Protection Strip, which remains without anthropic interventions for years, might indeed lead to a complete recovery of the ant species composition over time, reinforcing their great importance for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Natural regeneration in a mixed ombrophilous forest remnant in southern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of forest regeneration allows the diagnosis of conservation status of fragments and estimating population parameters that are essential for management projects. This study evaluated the structure, diversity and dynamics of the tree regenerating component of a remnant of mixed ombrophilous forest, aiming to support management actions for this forest type. The study was developed at the Parque Estadual das Araucarias (PEAR), located in the western region of the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. A total of 100 plots of 25 m(2) (0.25 ha) were allocated, all individuals with height = 1.0 m and DBH < 5 cm were sampled. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Pielou's equability index (J) and total natural regeneration rate (TNR) were estimated. We sampled 1,425 individuals from 99 species and 39 families, with an estimated total density of 5,700 individuals by hectare. The richest families were Fabaceae (13), Myrtaceae (10) and Lauraceae (7). The H' was 3.76 and the J was 0.80. The TNR rate ranged from 0.05 to 8.12%, highlighting Trichilia elegans, with the highest rate and Araucaria angustifolia with low potential for natural regeneration. The analysis of the results indicated a high diversity in the regenerating component of the PEAR compared to other studies, probably because the area presents itself as a successional mosaic due to past disturbances.

TI  - Challenges of Governing Second-Growth Forests: A Case Study from the Brazilian Amazonian State of Par
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing ecological and social importance of second-growth and regenerating forests across much of the world, significant inconsistencies remain in the legal framework governing these forests in many tropical countries and elsewhere. Such inconsistencies and uncertainties undermine attempts to improve both the transparency and sustainability of management regimes. Here, we present a case-study overview of some of the main challenges facing the governance of second-growth forests and the forest restoration process in the Brazilian Amazon, with a focus on the state of Par, which is both the most populous state in the Amazon and the state with the highest rates of deforestation in recent years. First, we briefly review the history of environmental governance in Brazil that has led to the current system of legislation governing second-growth forests and the forest restoration process in Par. Next, we draw on this review to examine the kinds of legislative and operational impediments that stand in the way of the development and implementation of a more effective governance system. In particular, we highlight problems created by significant ambiguities in legal terminology and inconsistencies in guidance given across different levels of government. We also outline some persistent problems with the implementation of legal guidance, including the need to understand local biophysical factors in order to guide an effective restoration program, as well as difficulties presented by access to technical assistance, institutional support and financial resources for the establishment and monitoring of both existing secondary forests and newly regenerating areas of forest. Whilst we focus here on a Brazilian case study, we suggest that these kinds of impediments to the good governance of second-growth forests are commonplace and require more concerted attention from researchers, managers and policy makers.

TI  - Restoring Brazilian savanna ground layer vegetation by topsoil and hay transfer
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical grassy biomes have been widely neglected for conservation and, after unplanned land use conversion, ecological restoration becomes urgent. The majority of interventions have been based on the misapplication of forest restoration techniques, because there are no validated techniques to restore the species-rich ground layer. In search for innovative techniques to restore the herbaceous layer of the cerrado vegetation, we carried out an experiment based upon topsoil and hay transfer, in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The restoration treatments were: ( 1) transfer of topsoil collected at the end of the dry season; ( 2) topsoil collected at the end of the rainy season; ( 3) transfer of hay collected at the end of the dry season; ( 4) topsoil+hay collected at the end of the dry season; and ( 5) control. We used an old-growth grassland as source of material and as reference ecosystem to assess the efficacy of the restoration techniques applied to an area severely degraded after invasion by African grasses. After 211 days, hay transfer apparently inhibited germination and did not contribute to grassland vegetation recovery. Topsoil transfer, however, was effective at reintroducing herbaceous plants, including target species. The season of topsoil collection mattered: material collected at the end of the rainy season provided better results in terms of density and richness of the restored community than that from the dry season. The remaining challenge is to find sources of topsoil not invaded by exotic grasses in large enough amounts to support restoration initiatives without jeopardizing the source ecosystems.

TI  - Forest transitions in tropical landscapes: A test in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing temporal changes in forest amount and configuration is paramount to better design future forest management interventions. Such analyses are especially required for tropical biomes, which are usually subject to dynamic and heterogeneous land uses. Recent studies have suggested that many tropical biomes are passing through the process of "forest transition", i.e. an overall change from forest loss to forest gain. However, this hypothesis remains scarcely tested, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed, quantitative historical records of forest cover. In this study, we investigate 38 years of land use change in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, from 1976 to 2014, using multitemporal datasets from aerial photographs and satellite images. We classified the historical series to produce land use maps and calculated a set of landscape metrics, including total forest cover, patch size, patch shape and patch connectivity. Our results indicated non-linear changes through time in forest loss and gain and also in landscape structure, which can be classified into two distinct periods. The first period (1976-1996) was marked by expressive forest loss and fragmentation, whereas the second (1996-2014) was characterized by a much less intense forest dynamics, with little deforestation being balanced by forest regeneration. We attribute the forest dynamics observed to temporal changes in socioeconomic factors, such as increasing human settlements and changes in environmental protection policies. Our results show that current forests are a heterogeneous mosaic of forests with different ages, and support the hypothesis that forest transition is occurring in Atlantic Forest landscapes.

TI  - Restoring riparian forest in the Atlantic Forest: does planting seedlings make a difference?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting seedlings remains the most popular method of forest restoration, but passive restoration may become a new promise to reduce costs, despite concerns about its efficacy. Here, we present a study of a riparian forest recovery program in the Southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. The objective was to compare planting seedlings and passive restoration eight years since restoration started and assess the influence of cattle presence in the restoring areas. We analyzed the structure, diversity, and composition of the woody community in the upper (canopy) and lower strata (understory) versus six environmental variables, including edaphic, landscape and geographical variables, restoration method (planting seedlings versus passive restoration), presence of cattle inside the restoration areas, and presence of adjacent crop plantations. Passive restoration generated a more diverse woody community and a higher proportion of climax and zoochoric species in the lower stratum than active restoration. Cattle presence was significantly associated with lower species richness and density of plants, as well as a higher proportion of pioneer species and low proportion of zoochoric and climax species. The results suggest that cattle can delay forest succession, besides reducing diversity. Passive restoration should be considered suitable for the region, and the efficiency of cattle exclusion needs to be improved.

TI  - Forest loss and fragmentation can promote the crowding effect in a forest-specialist primate
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly expanding across the tropics. Although forest loss is a major driver of the current biodiversity crisis, the effect of fragmentation remains debated, particularly for forest-specialist species. Objectives We evaluated the univariate and combined effect of forest loss (percent of forest cover) and fragmentation (forest patch density) on populations of a forest-specialist primate, the black-fronted titi monkey (Callicebus nigrifrons), in the landscapes from a transitional zone between Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Methods We surveyed titi monkey density in 14 landscapes. Using a multiscale and multimodel inference approach, we tested the relative effect of each landscape variable assessed at their respective scales of effect on titi monkey density. Results Titi monkey density ranged from 0 to 12 groups/km(2) and was best predicted by the combined effect of forest cover and patch density. Density increased in forest patches embedded in more deforested and fragmented landscapes. Interestingly, the effect of forest patch density was consistently positive along the entire evaluated forest cover gradient (9-42%). Conclusions Our findings support that fragmentation per se can have positive effects on biodiversity, in this case, by increasing the likelihood that more individuals can be 'rescued' from deforestation and crowded in the remaining forest patches. Although the long-term consequences of living crowded in forest patches are unknown, a conservative approach for preserving this (and potentially other) forest-specialist species could be to promote forest restoration projects focused on increasing the number and/or size of forest patches in the landscape (i.e., reverse fragmentation).

TI  - Use of Native Plant Species for Ecological Restoration and Rehabilitation Measures in Southeast Brazil
T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Southeast Brazil is the economic backbone of the country where about 70% of the national GDP is generated. The continuously growing pressure from rural and industrial land use is causing progressive land degradation, especially within the unique Atlantic Forest dominion of this region. Restoration and rehabilitation of degraded areas or of impact caused by building activities are still scarce and carried out using mainly technical engineering methods. Natural engineering or soil bioengineering measures using living plant material are very rare, and if applied, they mostly use non-native plants already proven to work in other tropical regions. As the demand for bioengineered rehabilitation and ecological restoration is expected to increase, suitable plant material is urgently needed. The use of non-native plants for engineering carries several ecological risks, in particular the invasive spread of these plants. This chapter provides a brief overview of the actual state of the art regarding the use of native and non-native plant species in rehabilitation and restoration measures applied in the Atlantic Forest dominion. Furthermore, first results are presented from a case study on bioengineered rehabilitation of a degraded pasture where plants native to Southeast Brazil were successfully used.

TI  - Short-term effects of passive restoration in springs habitats in Southern Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed natural regeneration floristic patterns in spring habitats submitted to different ecological restoration actions in the seasonal forest in Atlantic Forest biome. Rio Grande do Sul. We assessed floristic composition in six springs before restoration actions and 12 months later: We identified and counted all regenerating individuals with height greater than or equal to 30 cm and diameter at breast height less than or equal to 5 cm in eight plots in each spring. The richness and abundance of each spring and assessment were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P<0.05). Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was performed to verify floristic patterns and association between species. Results showed an increase in richness and abundance after ecological restoration implementation. The DCA showed a distinct floristic composition between springs. The springs remaining natural vegetation and the successional stage of these vegetation influenced the natural regeneration floristic composition pattern. Passive restoration, which was effective by enclosure, favored natural regeneration recruitment.

TI  - Vegetation regeneration in a sustainably harvested mangrove forest in West Papua, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bintuni Bay, located in the south of the Bird's Head Peninsula of West Papua, Indonesia, contains one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, growing in a variety of environmental conditions and geomorphologies. In the southern area of the bay, 82,120 ha of mangrove forest are actively undergoing a management regime conducted by PT. Bintuni Utama Murni Wood Industries (PT. BUMWI). Operations are focused upon woodchip production; however, sustainable forest management is also a priority as the area is Forest Stewardship Council (R) (FSC (R)) certified. Currently, PT BUMWI is approaching the completion of a 25-year rotation (with stands ranging from 0 to 25 years) which presents a good time to examine and evaluate current management practices and their effects on the forest concession. Part of a successful regeneration of a forest stand is attaining the range of ecological integrity and ecosystem functions similar to baseline forests. Forest structure and complexity, along with biodiversity at the stand level could function as regeneration criteria to evaluate the success of a sustainable forest management program. The objective of the study was to observe if the forest structure and biodiversity in secondary stands, considered as proxies for ecological integrity, would regenerate to similar levels within the 25 years as baseline forests. Post-harvest forest regeneration was evaluated in different aged secondary forest stands by measuring biomass, species composition and forest structure in circular plots along transects. Nonlinear regression was used to determine and predict different forest structure dynamics (sapling and stem densities, tree height, DBH), diversity and volumes throughout and beyond the 25-year rotation period. Dynamics in species composition and diversity of tree species was observed. Results suggest that the forest structure in secondary stands follows a natural regeneration dynamic over the rotation period but had not yet attained the same structure and composition as baseline forests at 25 years. Furthermore, growth models suggest that the harvest rotation may need to be extended to 30-40 years for secondary stands to attain similar ranges of forest structure, compositions and volumes to that of baseline forests. These observations will help future forest management of the concession as the company strives to manage secondary forests to keep the same ecosystem functions and high volumes observed in baseline forests.

TI  - Secondary forest regeneration under fast-growing forest plantations on degraded Imperata cylindrica grasslands
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration of native tree species in the understoreys of fast-growing plantation tree species (Acacia mangium, Gmelina arborea and Paraserianthes falcataria) and in adjacent natural riverine forest and non-cultivated grassland areas were studied on Imperata cylindrica grassland sites in Riam Kiwa plantation area, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seedling and sapling densities as well as species composition and richness were assessed in a total of 35 ha by a systematic line plot survey.Floristic composition was similar in A. mangium and P. falcataria stands which differed distinctly from G. arborea stands and Imperata grassland area. Riverine forest was characterized by later successional species. In A. mangium and P. falcataria stands, a total of 63 species from 24 families were recorded. Seedling stock consisted merely of pioneer and secondary species, but also several fairly commonly occurring primary forest species. Euphorbiaceae was the most common family representing 42% of sapling and 29% of seedling densities. The most abundant regeneration occurred in A. mangium stands (4,706 seedling/sapling ha(-1)), followed by P. falcataria (2,242 ha(-1)) and G. arborea (554 ha(-1)). Seedling recruitment was significantly lower in plots dominated by grass vegetation than those dominated by no vegetation or shrub vegetation. Breast height diameter and basal area of canopy trees as well as coverage and height of ground vegetation did not explain seedling/sapling density. Results show that plantation establishment with suitable fast-growing tree species facilitates recruitment of a variety of native tree species. This provides potential for rapid restoration of forest ecosystem and for further development of the mixed stands of fast-growing exotics and naturally regenerated native species.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study was conducted on the Agua Turva Stream bank, in the Hydrographic Microbasin of the Jirau Alto River, in Dois Vizinhos county, Parana state, aiming to evaluate the environmental impacts of the urban occupations and agricultural activities on the floristic composition and the phytosociological structure of the arboreal stratum of the riparian forest, to obtain information on species diversity and biological invasion, which will enable the establishment of future forest restoration programs. The data collect was realized in ten sample points demarcated along the stream, where 20 sample plots of 10.0 x 10.0 m (100.0 m(2)) were demarcated, 10 in each stream margin. The species were identified and evaluated regarding the following variables: the CAP (Circumference at Breast Height) and total height of all the trees with CAP >= 15.0 cm (DBH >= 4.8 cm). The vegetation structure was analyzed based on the phytosociological estimators and the indexes of diversity, equability and environmental impact index of exotic species. It was concluded that the riparian forest of the Agua Turva creek is quite impacted, both in the rural and urban areas, with invasion of exotic species, mainly Hovenia dulcis (japanese grape) and Musa sp. (banana tree).

TI  - Survival and growth of tree species after kaolin mining in eastern Amazonia, Brazil: accelerating restoration through physical alteration of Technosol
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background and aimsMining causes severe damage to forest ecosystems, and the restoration of these environments in Amazonia remains a challenge. The first step is restoring the quality of the Technosol for plant establishment. This study evaluated the effects of pit size on the chemical properties of Technosol and the performance of selected tree species. MethodsThree different pit sizes were tested: Small Pit or Control (CTR), Medium Pit (MP), and Large Pit (LP) in an area degraded by kaolin mining. Four tree species were used for each pit size. After 24 months of planting, the chemical properties of Technosol, survival, periodic annual increment (PAI) for total height (PAIHt) and diameter at soil height (PAIDSH), canopy area (CA), and aboveground biomass (AGB) were evaluated. ResultsThe study found no significant differences in the chemical properties of Technosol across pit sizes (CTR, MP and LP). Survival rates were consistently high for all treatments. MP and LP provided the best increases in PAIHt of Tapirira guianensis. Average CA values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 1.82 +/- 0.31 m2 between species, and LP provided the highest average CA for Terminalia argentea. Furthermore, pit size influenced AGB in Moquilea tomentosa, Terminalia argentea, and Tapirira guianensis. ConclusionThe restoration technique significantly impacted Technosol properties and species performance, highlighting its role in ecological recovery. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing forest restoration techniques in tropical regions impacted by mining.

TI  - Monitoring of Amazonian Forest ecosystem: Present conjuncture on the use of remote sensing technology
T2  - Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking into account the need of an upgrade on remote sensing applications on Ecology and Biodiversity studies, the objective of this paper is to show the state of the art of these technologies to monitor the forest cover and deforestation process occurring in the Brazilian Amazon Region. An analysis on the importance of orbital remote sensing data (Landsat/TM, ERS-1/SAR,...) was done in order to characterize land use changes. The present annual conversion rate of forests (mainly for pasture, agricultural use) in Amazonia is 0.26% per year. Furthermore, comments are made on the use of segmentation and classification of digital images together with GIS as a component of an Amazonia Database made by INPE. The use of NOAA/AVHRR data is demonstrated for the analysis of seasonal behavior of the vegetation cover as well as for the detection of biomass burning. A description is made of the results from SAREX mission in Amazonia (a Canadian airborne C-Band SAR), with simulations of RADARSAT, are described, in order to show the potential of new spaceborne radar sensor systems to identify abandoned deforested areas with natural regeneration process.

TI  - Estimation of wood density in living trees of Cedrela fissilis Vell. through resistographic analysis
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration aims at providing conditions for the restoration of the ecosystem, also the forest species. In this regard new methodologies are used to monitor the development and characteristics of individuals without cutting of trees. The resistographic analysis is a technique which aims to describe the profile of the radial variation of timber. The objective of this study was to evaluate the density of Cedrela fissilis Vell. wood (cedro rosa) through the resistographic technique and to correlate it with the basic density data generated by the gravimetric method, seeking thus to evaluate and prove the efficiency of non-destructive method and its potential to generate information on plant health, wood density of and possible uses of the species. The tests were performed on 24 trees of Cedrela fissilis Vell. in a restoration forest area, which were divided into three diameter classes. The gravimetric density analysis in the three diameter classes showed no statistically significant difference at 5%. The results of the assessment demonstrated difference between the diametrical classes and the resistographic amplitude (r= 0,709). When correlated, tests showed a significant correlation (r= 0,549), confirming the efficiency of this nondestructive method to determine the density of the wood of living trees of cedro rosa.

TI  - Mapping Atlantic rainforest degradation and regeneration history with indicator species using convolutional network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near Sao Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at similar to 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region's natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, similar to 4757 ha) and that similar to 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).

TI  - Restoration of coastal ecosystems as an approach to the integrated mangrove ecosystem management and mitigation and adaptation to climate changes in north coast of East Java
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is very basic and appears on earth. Climate change has become an issue that must be faced by humans today and in the future. One of the impacts of climate change can be found in coastal areas. Tsunamis and tidal floods repeatedly occur in coastal areas. One of the efforts to overcome sea level rise that causes tsunamis, erosion, and tidal flooding is mangrove forests. This study aims to determine public awareness of the occurrence of tidal flooding and tsunami and to find an easy and inexpensive way to overcome it. This research is integrated using the partial least square (PLS) approach and the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) approach to mangrove forests. The results showed that the awareness and assessment of the community to carry out mangrove forest restoration to overcome disasters caused by climate change must be managed and handled with a co-management approach..

TI  - Plant-canopy Effects on Natural Regeneration in Sites Under Restoration: Do Tree Species Matter?
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - How does species choice influence ecological restoration outcomes? In order to answer this question, the goal of this study was to assess the community structure and species richness of natural regeneration beneath the canopy of four native species from the Atlantic Forest (Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer; Ingo edulis Mart; Nectandra membranacea (SW) Griseb; and, Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr). The research was carried out in plantations of native tree species at the Guapiacu Ecological Reserve, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Our results pointed that abundance, basal area and species richness were significantly higher beneath Inga compared to Nectandra and Guarea. Whereas the lowest values observed in Guarea may suggest its negative effects under natural regeneration. Therefore, we highlighted that the positive or negative biological effects of tree species, instead of their simple response (mortality and initial growth), must be considered in ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of Drosophila (Hexapoda, Diptera) in post-mining sites under different forest restoration techniques in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas-Para, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years).

TI  - POTENTIAL AREAS FOR THE FORMATION OF ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS BETWEEN REMNANTS OF ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, the remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are intensely fragmented. The connection of forest fragments through ecological corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraiba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraiba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh.m(-2)) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors.

TI  - Property size and forest cover were key determinants of forest restoration in Southern Bahia in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration has gained traction as a solution to mitigate climate change, contribute to biodiversity conservation, and support forest livelihoods. Yet there is limited evidence on the spatial locations where restoration is most likely to occur. In landscapes that primarily contain private properties, assessing the likelihood of restoration can be informed by understanding the enabling and limiting factors that have influenced propertylevel restoration in the past. In this paper, we tested the relationships between restoration, property size, and forest cover, for 8451 properties between 1985 and 2019 in Southern Bahia, Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We found that spatial property-level variables were strongly associated with restoration. First, we found that property size was positively correlated with the amount of restoration per property. Medium-sized properties (between 40 and 127 ha) accounted for the most restoration in aggregate. Second, we found that properties with less forest cover were associated with higher amounts of restoration. In addition, for properties larger than 20 ha, those with intermediate amounts of forest cover had high amounts of restoration. Third, we found that restoration was a spatial process that occurred in hotspots rather than randomly across the study landscape, indicating that restoration often occurred near to other restored properties. Understanding these relationships may assist restoration planners in making more informed estimates of the conditions that might enable future restoration. Given that restoration is a complex process that may require different approaches in different socioenvironmental contexts, decision-makers may consider identifying and prioritizing properties of different sizes and with different amounts of forest cover depending on their specific priorities, landscape-level conditions, and restoration context. Our spatial analysis techniques assist in improving broader understanding of possible ways in which land use policy could prioritize for restoration at the property level and could later be applied to other socio-environmental tropical forest systems.

TI  - Integrating the resilience concept into ecosystem restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring resilient ecosystems is critical to preparing for the uncertain effects of climatic change on ecosystem functioning and socially relevant services. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration attempts to inspire the global ecological restoration movement, reverse degradation, and mitigate climate change impacts. We present ways in which resilience might be further integrated into the science of restoration ecology and the practice of ecological restoration to address the uncertainty associated with the current impacts of adverse climatic change. We describe how incorporating meaningful community engagement, expanding monitoring indicators, and upscaling across spatial-temporal scales will improve the current state of ecosystem restoration. We present case studies of restoration approaches across Southeast Asia that utilize approaches that confer resilience (resistance, recovery, reorganization) in their restoration projects and their broader social-ecological systems. The panarchy framework encapsulates the importance of strengthening relationships between all stakeholders and restoration projects to build resilience across larger spatial-temporal scales.

TI  - Ecological outcomes of Atlantic Forest restoration initiatives by sugar cane producers
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian environmental law (the Forest Code) compels large landowners to conserve a proportion of forest on their properties, often necessitating restoration of degraded habitat. Sugar cane producers have been active participants in these restoration projects, especially in the northeast region where sugar cane has largely replaced the exceptionally biodiverse Atlantic forest. Despite the potential conservation importance of such restoration projects there have been few evaluations of their outcomes. Here, we assess sugar cane company restoration projects in an Atlantic rainforest region of northeast Brazil. Specifically, we assess the ability of restoration projects to: (i) restore species diversity and vegetation structure; (ii) increase connectivity between forest fragments, and; (iii) restore assemblage composition. Restored areas contained approximately half the species richness of remnant fragments and had a substantially different species composition. Moreover, the density of trees in restored areas was a third of that in remnants, despite a very similar height profile. The currently poor outcomes of Atlantic Forest restoration projects in northeast Brazil are a consequence of a severely limited capacity for natural regeneration and poor restoration practices. We conclude by identifying possible strategies to improve the quality of privately financed restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Secondary forest buffers the effects of fragmentation on aerial insectivorous bat species following 30 years of passive forest restoration.
T2  - Restoration Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive forest restoration can buffer the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. We acoustically surveyed aerial insectivorous bats in a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over a 2-year period, across 33 sites, comprising continuous old-growth forest, remnant fragments, and regenerating secondary forest matrix. We analyzed the activity of 10 species/sonotypes to investigate occupancy across habitat types and responses to fragment size and interior-edge-matrix (IEM) disturbance gradients. Employing a multiscale approach, we investigated guild (edge foragers, forest specialists, flexible forest foragers, and open space specialists) and species-level responses to vegetation structure and forest cover, edge, and patch density across six spatial scales (0.5-3 km). We found species-specific habitat occupancy patterns and nuanced responses to fragment size and the IEM disturbance gradient. For example, Furipterus horrens had lower activity in secondary forest sites and the interior and edge of the smallest fragments (1 and 10 ha) compared to continuous forest, and only two species (Pteronotus spp.) showed no habitat preference and no significant responses across the IEM and fragment size gradients. Only the Molossus sonotype responded negatively to vegetation structure. We uncovered no negative influence of forest cover or edge density at guild or species-level. Our results indicate that reforestation can buffer the negative effects of fragmentation and although these effects can still be detected in some species, generally aerial insectivorous bats appear to be in recovery after 30 years of passive forest restoration. Our findings reinforce the need to protect regenerating forests while conserving vast expanses of old-growth forest.

TI  - Topoclimatic Zoning of Three Native Amazonian Forest Species: Approach to Sustainable Silviculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropized areas in the Brazilian Amazon require detailed mapping to identify zones for sustainable use. This study developed a topoclimatic zoning framework to evaluate the conservation and agroforestry potential of three native species: Carapa guianensis (Andiroba), Dipteryx odorata (Cumaru), and Bertholletia excelsa (Amazon Nut). The hypothesis was that integrating topographic and climatic data can effectively identify high-potential areas for these species to support forest restoration and sustainable management. This study applied ecological modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to classify zones into high, medium, and low potential for each species. Results showed Carapa guianensis has high potential in 64% of anthropized areas, Dipteryx odorata in 72% of the Legal Amazon, and Bertholletia excelsa in 58%, highlighting their adaptability and strategic value for restoration efforts. The findings emphasize the importance of topoclimatic zoning as a tool for conservation and sustainable use strategies. By aligning with Brazil's Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Law, this approach can foster agroforestry practices, enhance biodiversity conservation, and strengthen the Amazon bioeconomy, ensuring ecological resilience and sustainable development.

TI  - What makes ecosystem restoration expensive? A systematic cost assessment of projects in Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited funding is a major barrier to implementing ambitious global restoration commitments, so reducing restoration costs is essential to upscale restoration. The lack of rigorous analyses about the major components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil's National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys (60-90%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of magnitude cheaper but were reported in < 15% of projects. The vast majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during the implementation phase, and nearly 80% of projects ended maintenance within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US$0.7-1.2 billion per year until 2030 to implement Brazil's restoration plan depending on the area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up restoration at a global scale.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the native forest cover in the Guandu River hydrographic basin (GRHB) between the years 1985 and 2020, using landscape ecology metrics.Methodology: The land cover and land use values from the MapBiomas project in the years 1985 and 2020 were used. The native forest fragments were classified according to their size, as C1 (< 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.1-50 ha), and C4 (> 50 ha). Landscape ecology metrics were calculated using the V-Late 2.0 extension in ArcGIS((R)).Originality/Relevance: Study of the temporal dynamics of forest cover of hydrographic basins is essential to define strategic forest conservation and restoration actions aimed at protecting water resources.Results: The native forest cover of the GRHB increased by approximately 12%, with an increase in the number and average area of fragments. In general, the forest remnants became closer to each other and demonstrated a higher edge density. A high number of small fragments (< 5 ha) was verified and the largest fragments (> 50 ha) were the main factor responsible for the expansion of the native forest cover in the basin.Social/management contributions: Forest restoration actions in the GRHB should prioritize the connectivity of smaller fragments. In addition to supporting forest restoration projects, the results contribute to the application of methodologies to implement water resource management instruments, helping to define practices and policies for sustainable water use.

TI  - EVALUATION OF SOIL SEEDS BANK FOR FOREST RESTORATION IN CARANDAI, MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of soil seeds bank provides essential information on the potential of regeneration in a particular areas, allowing inferences on its restoration. By using 20 plots with 25 x 25 cm and 5 cm deep, samples of soils from different environmental situations, identified in a rural property in Caranda, MG, were collected (clean pasture, dirty pasture, coppice, eucalyptus and forest). The collected material was put to be germinated in a greenhouse and analyzed for eight months, where composition and the density of the species (herbaceous, sub-shrubby, shrubby and arboreal) were evaluated. The environmental situations presented different expressions of natural regeneration. The dirty pasture was the situation that presented the largest number of regenerating herbaceous trees, what makes it more problematic for forest restoration. All the environmental situations presented bank of seeds of arboreal and shrubby seedlings, which may help the restoration process. However, the success of this activity will be directly linked to the activities of competitor control, mainly of Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster, an aggressive grass that germinates in every environmental situation. Due to the absence of species in final succession stage in the seed bank in the soil, there might have been other complementary interventions such as planting of seedlings, direct sowing of tree species and/or implantation of artificial galleries to accelerate the vegetable succession.

TI  - The human-macaque interface: Conservation implications of current and future overlap and conflict in lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, I examine overlapping resource use of forest and cultivated resources by villagers and tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. An integrative research design was employed, using methods from primatology and cultural anthropology, in conjunction with quantitative measurements of cacao crop loss. The results indicate that the current patterns of overlapping resource use may not be severely affecting the tonkean macaques or villagers in Lindu. The research does, however, point to possible future difficulty if cacao crop raiding by macaques increases, and as changing socioeconomic trends and loss of traditional folklore result in further modification of macaque habitat. Successful strategies to ameliorate human-macaque conflict may require efforts aimed at the adoption of alternative buffer zone crops that use shade-management systems, the deliberate protection of important macaque food species, and increasing local tolerance to crop raiding by exploring the role of macaques in forest regeneration.

TI  - The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forests and second growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation.

TI  - Monitoring early-successional trees for tropical forest restoration using low-cost UAV-based species classification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Logged forests cover four million square kilometers of the tropics, capturing carbon more rapidly than temperate forests and harboring rich biodiversity. Restoring these forests is essential to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet monitoring tropical forest recovery is challenging. We track the abundance of early-successional species in a forest restoration concession in Indonesia. If the species are carefully chosen, they can be used as an indicator of restoration progress. We present SLIC-UAV, a new pipeline for processing Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)to map early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline comprises: (a) a field verified approach for manually labeling species; (b) automatic segmentation of imagery into "superpixels" and (c) machine learning classification of species based on both spectral and textural features. Creating superpixels massively reduces the dataset's dimensionality and enables the use of textural features, which improve classification accuracy. In addition, this approach is flexible with regards to the spatial distribution of training data. This allowed us to be flexible in the field and collect high-quality training data with the help of local experts. The accuracy ranged from 74.3% for a four-species classification task to 91.7% when focusing only on the key early-succesional species. We then extended these models across 100 hectares of forest, mapping species dominance and forest condition across the entire restoration project.

TI  - Planning forest restoration within private land holdings with conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss is mainly due to the conversion of forest to agriculture, mostly in private lands. Forest restoration is a global priority, yet restoration targets are ambitious and budget-limited. Therefore, assessing the outcome of alternative decisions on land-use within private lands is paramount to perform cost-effective restoration. We present a novel framework that incorporates spatial planning for forest restoration within private lands with conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale. As a case study, we used three real landscapes of 10.000 ha with differing amounts of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, and three hypothetical animal species with different dispersal abilities. We estimated the total amount of forest that landholders must restore to comply with the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which requires landholders to reforest 20% of their land within a 20-year time frame. We compared the costeffectiveness of five restoration strategies based on the improvement in habitat availability and restoration costs. The most cost-effective strategy depends on a landscape's initial amount of forest cover and the species of concern. We revealed that spatial planning for restoration in private lands increased habitat availability up to 12 times more than random restoration, which was always the least cost-effective strategy. Cost-effective large-scale restoration in Brazil depends on public policies that assist landholders to comply with the law and on prioritizing areas for restoration within private lands. We show that by adding habitat availability as target in spatial prioritization, benefits for biodiversity can be hastened at low additional cost, even in real world scenarios with severe spatial constraints. Despite constraints, spatially planned restoration for law compliance in Brazil increased landscape permeability by creating corridors and stepping stones. Our framework should be used to plan restoration in Brazilian private lands and can be customized for other regions worldwide. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Supplying Sawmills with Native Species from Ecological Restoration in Southeastern Brazil: Analysis of Potential
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of native species used in ecological restoration in Brazil (Peltophorum dubium - canafistula, Hymenaea courbaril - jatoba, Jacaranda cuspidifolia - jacaranda, and Enterolobium contortisiliquum - timboril) as raw material for the supply of sawmills. Due to the difficulties in sampling trees of native species, four trees per species were collected, at age of 12 years, in a legal reserve area. The sampled trees were evaluated as being quite characteristic of trees of the same genetic material. The trees' diameter was measured, the percentage of bark and the taper were measured, and the lumber yield of each species was calculated. The boards were air-dried. Based on the DBH, timboril had the greatest potential for biomass production, but its wood quality was unsatisfactory. To supply raw material for sawmills, in addition to jatoba, we suggest investing in plantations of canafistula and jacaranda.

TI  - Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience for Climate Change Mitigation: Case Studies from the Southeast Asia Region with a Focus on Wastewater Treatment Plants in Addressing Flooding Challenges
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change poses challenges to infrastructure resilience in Southeast Asia's flood-prone regions. This study identifies and evaluates strategies for enhancing infrastructure resilience through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyzed the case studies and conducted quantitative assessments of flood mitigation efforts. Data were collected (2021-2024) through site visits, interviews with key stakeholders, and analysis of historical flood and infrastructure performance data. Data analysis involved statistical methods for assessing their effectiveness and comparative analyses across them. Singapore reduced flood-prone areas by 30% using integrated WWTP technologies with drainage systems, while Malaysia developed resilient infrastructure networks with WWTPs designed to withstand extreme weather, preventing 85% of contamination cases. Thailand combined green and blue infrastructure with WWTPs, decreasing flood vulnerability by 25%. Indonesia invested in decentralized WWTPs in urban areas, increasing infrastructure resilience by 40%. Nature-based solutions, such as ecological restoration, reduce flooding impacts by 20%. The implications for policymakers and practitioners include the need to integrate advanced technologies and nature-based solutions to bolster infrastructure resilience and mitigate flooding risks. This study offers insights into developing effective climate change adaptation strategies in flood-vulnerable regions, emphasizing the critical role of WWTPs in enhancing infrastructure resilience.

TI  - On the need of legal frameworks for assessing restoration projects success: new perspectives from SAo Paulo state (Brazil)
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite growing worldwide commitment to large-scale ecosystem restoration, national public policies on restoration are few, and those that exist tend to be vague. Brazil and especially SAo Paulo state stand out. In a pioneering attempt to improve restoration projects and their outcomes, the Secretariat for the Environment of the State of SAo Paulo has enacted a legal instrument to drive planning and to assess whether the goals and targets of mandatory ecological restoration are being achieved. Regardless of the restoration techniques applied, the effectiveness of mandatory or public-funded projects will henceforth be assessed by using three ecological indicators: (1) ground coverage with native vegetation; (2) density of native plants spontaneously regenerating; and (3) number of spontaneously regenerating native plant species. We analyze how this science-based legal framework is expected to promote greater restoration success, improve cost-effectiveness, and help bridge the all-too-familiar knowledge-action gap in environmental policies. Notably, scientists, professionals, public agents, and stakeholders from different institutions have collaborated to advance the refinement and rolling out of this legal instrument. By 2037, it is expected that more than 300,000 restoration projects will be carried out in SAo Paulo state and monitored using this set of indicators. We also suggest that this approach could be usefully applied to the growing number of ecological restoration programs being carried out worldwide, especially in the context of offset policies intended to achieve serious compensation for environmental degradation or loss of biodiversity.

TI  - New compostable tubes for the production of high quality seedlings of three species of Mimosa spp
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining high-quality native species seedlings and sustainable alternatives for seedling production are currently some of the bottlenecks for successful restoration plantings in degraded ecosystems. This study evaluated the survival and vigor of seminal seedlings of Mimosa flocculosa, M. micropteris and Al. incana, produced in three containers (110 cm(3) and 55 cm(3) polypropylene tubes and 58 cm(3) SISBGC type biocompostable container) for ecological restoration purposes in the phytogeographic region of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. Survival, total height, stem diameter, shoot and root dry biomass, sturdiness quotient, Dickson's quality index and technical efficiency were evaluated. Survival percentages were higher for the three Mimosa species throughout all evaluations and in the three containers, with an average over 95 %, demonstrating the viability of the seedling production protocol used. Although the 110 cm(3) tube favored larger seedling growth, especially in M. flocculosa, the SISBGC tube showed similar efficiency for M. micropteris and M. incana. We conclude that a good performance in the nursery, associated with the bio-decomposition characteristics, makes SISBGC an excellent alternative for producing native seedlings for ecological restoration purposes.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the seed bank transposition for ecological restoration of the Seasonal Forest in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul. We evaluated the seed bank of the center (BSI) and the seed bank of the edge (BSII) of a forest fragment. The soil was deposited in 1 m2 plots in a completely randomized design with three treatments (BSI, BSII and control) and six replications, in two soil types, Argisol Bruno-Greying (PBAC) and Ultisol (PV). We evaluated floristic composition, seedling emergence, density and mortality in each treatment and soil for twelve months. We carried out ANOVA with repeated measures from twelve months to compare treatments in relation to emergency, density, mortality and species richness. There was a significant difference between treatments for richness and density. The number of species has been increasing over the twelve months. The density was influenced by the winter period and degree of soil hydromorphy. Transposition of the seed bank enabled the inclusion of the tree lifeform and demonstrate to be efficient presenting increase diversity in the deposition sites.

TI  - Megastigmus seed wasp damage on native Schinus terebinthifolia drupes in ecological restoration area in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Megastigmus transvaalensis Hussey (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) parasitizes drupes of Rhus genus plants in Africa and Schinus (Anacardiaceae) in South America. This exotic wasp damages Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi drupes in native forests and ecological restoration areas in Brazil. The objective of the present study was to investigate the precipitation, temperature and relative humidity effects on M. transvaalensis flight activity, and to determine the parasitism rate and sex ratio of this wasp on S. terebinthifolia plants. The study was conducted with yellow sticky traps and S. terebinthifolia drupes collected in an ecological restoration area, from August 2014 to September 2015, in the Sorocaba municipality, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Megastigmus transvaalensis populations were negatively correlated with maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation, with population peaks at the end of May 2015, with 927 insects per evaluation (48.8 adults per trap). The M. transvaalensis sex ratio was higher in the laboratory (0.42) than in the field (0.08). The parasitism rate of S. terebinthifolia drupes by M. transvaalensis ranged from zero to 36.3% under natural environmental conditions. Megastigmus transvaalensis can be monitored with yellow sticky traps. Damage by M. transvaalensis in S. terebinthifolia drupes may decrease the germination of the seeds and the establishment of this plant in native and restoration ecological areas.

TI  - Applicability of monitoring protocols developed for active restoration projects in the evaluation of passive restoration of a subtropical riparian forest in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current restoration monitoring protocols have been developed for active restoration projects (based on planting seedlings) and little is known about their applicability in assessing vegetation resulting from passive restoration, an important knowledge gap for the restoration of tropical and subtropical forests. The present study was developed in a 12-year-old subtropical riparian forest undergoing passive restoration (based on spontaneous natural regeneration), and aimed to evaluate the regenerating vegetation using two monitoring protocols developed for active ecological restoration. The following indicators of restoration success were evaluated: canopy cover; basal area; above-ground biomass; total richness; richness and density of regenerating trees. Passive restoration strategy has been found to be successful in the study area as the observed values for the indicators (except basal area and biomass) were above reference values specified for a 12-year-old active restoration. Our results also show that for most of the indicators of restoration success, the reference values established for the evaluation of active restoration projects may be surpassed through unassisted natural regeneration, suggesting the feasibility of the application of these monitoring protocols for the evaluation of passive restoration projects.

TI  - Artificial perches and solarization for forest restoration: assessment of their value
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial perches have been considered an effective way to increase the influx of zoochoric seeds on degraded areas. A main barrier to seedling recruitment beneath perches is competition with other plants, including non-native or invasive species. We therefore believed that the seedling recruitment would increase with invasive species management through solarization. We assessed the use of artificial perches combined with solarization as a management technique for forest restoration. An outline of subdivided plots was installed in an abandoned pasture originally covered by subtropical Atlantic forest in southern Brazil. The invasive species were Nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus - Cyperaceae) and African Liverseed Grass (Urochloa arrecta - Poaceae). Solarization was achieved using a black polyethylene cover. Artificial perches were installed after solarization was complete. Seed rain and established plant community species were assessed. Solarization initially eliminated previously existing vegetation, but the effects were not long lasting. Invasive species grew aggressively by vegetative means from the borders of solarized areas. Artificial perches increased the influx of zoochoric seeds, but the seeds were unable to germinate and establish due to competition by the fast growing invasive species. The combined use of artificial perches and solarization for forest restoration seems to have limited effectiveness.

TI  - Ecological Parameters and Population Dynamics of Leaf Litter Insect Fauna in Areas in Process of Ecological Restoration.
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf litter insect fauna stands out for its high abundance, diversity, ecological importance and sensitivity to environmental changes. Thus, they have great potential as bioindicators of ecological restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the population dynamics, and composition of the leaf litter insect fauna (Class Insecta) in areas with different ecological restoration techniques in the Serra do Itajai National Park. Four sample areas were determined, being: native forest (reference area), natural regeneration, brushwood transposition and soil roughness. Collections were carried out from August/2014 to August/2015, bimonthly, from the installation of a pitfall trap and Berlese-Tullgren funnel. The abundance, number of families, similarity, composition, population dynamics of the most abundant families and correlation with environmental factors were analyzed. A total of 16,062 individuals were collected, distributed in 15 orders and 104 families. No significant differences were observed in the abundance and number of families between the sample areas. The area of natural regeneration showed the highest percentage of similarity with the area of native forest. Temperature was the only environmental factor that significantly influenced the abundance of Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae, Curculionidae (Coleoptera), Cercopidae, Aphidiae (Hemiptera) and Gryllidae (Orthoptera) families. The composition of families varied significantly between the sample areas. It is concluded that litter entomofauna families have potential for use as bioindicators in monitoring ecological restoration. Temperature is a variable that must be considered in the definition and implementation of restoration strategies in order to favor the restoration of the leaf litter insect fauna.

TI  - Effects of a native bamboo species on tree regeneration diversity of a subtropical Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of native bamboo species is considered a factor that affects the dynamics of plant communities in tropical and subtropical forests. In southern Brazil, Merostachys skvortzovii is a long-lasting species (reproductive cycles of 32 years) highly dominant in disturbed areas, causing structural changes in the tree community. In this work, we assessed changes in regeneration communities in 11 years after a reproductive event of M. skvortzvii. We asked if canopy openness and time after bamboo reproduction affect taxonomic and functional diversities of regeneration communities. We installed 20 permanent plots were randomly distributed in the continuous canopy (CC) and open canopy (OC), measured bamboo culms density, and surveyed the regeneration community over the period 2008-2017, and used a generalized linear model to explore the effects of the environment and presence of bamboos on the diversity of regeneration community. We observed an increase in abundance, species richness, and beta diversity over time after the reproductive event, but the time did not affect the Shannon -Wiener index. The canopy opening positively affected the individual abundance species richness, beta di-versity, Functional richness (FRic), Functional evenness (FEve) and Functional dispersion (FDis). Also, we found an effect of the canopy opening on the functional attributes positively affecting specific leaf area (SLA) and negatively affecting leaf mass area (LMA) and Leaf carbon content (LCC). We concluded that, despite the intense colonization after the reproduction, the bamboo population follows a decreasing dynamic without negative ef-fects on the regeneration of subtropical forest species, which are more affected by the dynamics of the gaps than bamboo presence. These results show that the subtropical Atlantic Forest regeneration community can restructure itself in the understory without the need for bamboo management.

TI  - Fire Effects on Understory Forest Regeneration in Southern Amazonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire in tropical forests increases tree mortality, degrades forest structure, and reduces carbon stocks. Currently, there are large gaps in understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts. Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State, southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i) does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and 16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness, and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small, medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50% in the most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global vegetation carbon sink.

TI  - Allometric equations for estimating tree biomass in restored mixed-species Atlantic Forest stands
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of Atlantic Forests is receiving increasing attention because of its role in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration for global climate change mitigation. This study was carried out in an Atlantic Forest restoration project in the south-central region of Sao Paulo State - Brazil to develop allometric equations to estimate tree biomass of indigenous tree species in mixed plantations. Above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively), stem diameter (DBH: diameter at 1.3 m height), tree height (H: total height) and specific wood density (WD) were measured for 60 trees of 19 species. Different biomass equations (linear and nonlinear-transformed) were adjusted to estimate AGB and BGB as a function of DBH, H and WD. For estimating AGB and BGB, the linear biomass equation models were the least accurate. The transformed nonlinear biomass equation that used log DBH2, log H and log WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for AGB and the transformed nonlinear biomass equations that used log DBH2*WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for BGB. It is concluded that these adjusted equations can be used to estimate the AGB and BGB in areas of the studied project. The adjusted equations can be recommended for use elsewhere in the region for forest stands of similar age, tree size ranges, species composition and site characteristics.

TI  - Recovery of amphibian species richness and composition in a chronosequence of secondary forests, northeastern Costa Rica
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In some tropical regions, following the abandonment of agriculture and pastures, secondary forests can recover plant species richness and forest structure (e.g. canopy cover, biomass); however, the importance of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear. Secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In Puerto Rico, 1-5 years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests, while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19 years of recovery only recovered 60% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age, aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition. We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in Costa Rica, and even young forests (10-16 years) had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians. In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline.

TI  - Strategic landscape analysis relating multicriteria analysis and socioeconomic and environmental context to define potential areas for active restoration in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To optimize forest restoration initiatives, landscape planning emerges as a strategy. Thus, this work aims to determine the active restoration potential in Vale do Paraiba, a Brazilian region inserted in the Atlantic Forest biome, using multicriteria analysis and analyzing the result in light of socioeconomic and environmental contexts. Land use and land cover (LULC), hydrography, and slope variables were used in the multicriteria analysis, while average municipal income per capita, availability of restoration areas on rural lands, and water supply basins were used as socioeconomic and environmental variables. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Inference by the gamma operator were employed as multicriteria analysis methods. Two comparisons were performed with AHP, resulting in weights of 0.6 (LULC) and 0.2 (slope and hydrography) for AHP 1, and 0.5 (LULC) and 0.25 (slope and hydrography) for AHP 2. Values of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 were used in the gamma operator in Fuzzy Inference. Comparing results with restoration sites already implemented, AHP 2 was considered the best method. The restoration potential of each municipality was determined. Then, we grouped those with more areas for restoration, as an opportunity to develop common forest restoration programs. Ten water supply basins were identified with more than 40% of region extension with high restoration potential. Municipalities with a lower average per capita income and higher restoration potential were identified, highlighting a potential to generate income through restoration. The study concluded that Vale do Paraiba has a high potential for active restoration.

TI  - Mapping selective logging impacts in Borneo with GPS and airborne lidar
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a promising management strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, but incentive mechanisms are hindered by inadequate monitoring methods. We mapped 937 ha of logging infrastructure in a selectively harvested tropical forest to inform a scalable approach to measuring the impacts of discrete management practices (hauling, skidding, and felling). We used a lidar-derived disturbance model to map all skid trails and haul roads within 26 months of the selective harvest of six blocks of dipterocarp forest in five industrial concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Lidar maps of logging impacts (220 ha) agreed well with ground-based maps (total of 217 ha, RMS error of 6 ha or 3%), but skid trail positions agreed only 59% of the time. Due to rapid forest regeneration, total lidar-derived haul road area was 31% smaller than road area measured in the field; agreement was higher for lidar collections within a year of the harvest. Maps of carbon density generated from Fourier transforms of lidar height profiles estimated skidding and felling biomass losses to within 1-5% of ground-based measurements. Lidar-derived skidding and hauling impact zones covered only 69% of the permitted harvest area; the remaining areas showed no signs of logging disturbance, and available biophysical data did not explain their location. These results emphasize the need for more extensive mapping of logging infrastructure to capture spatial variability in skid trail density and hitherto undetected no-impact zones. While a ground-based GPS is recommended as the most affordable method for wide-scale infrastructure mapping, aerial lidar is an effective tool for remotely quantifying the extent of logging impacts in tropical forests.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Structure and floristic composition of forest regeneration ( trees between 1 and 10 cm diameter at breast height (d. b. h), greater than or equal to 1 m growth height) was described in three forest types of Amazonian white-water forests (varzea), in order to analyse whether floristic composition of saplings is related to the successional stage of the forests, whether it differs in comparision with the mature flora, and if there exists a zonation of sapling species along the gradients of flooding and irradiation.Location Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Western Brazilian Amazon.Methods The investigated forests were of the low and the high varzea type, on an annual average flooded around 4 and 1 months, respectively. The two low-varzea forests belonged to the secondary and to the late-successional stage, the high-varzea forest also to the late-successional stage. A total of 24 circular sample plots covering 1885 m 2 were installed. They were nested within three rectangular 1 ha permanent sample plots where individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h. were formerly inventoried. Average inundation and radiation [ relative photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR)] at the forest floor was recorded in all inventoried plots. The Mean spatial Distribution Center (MDC; Ebdon, 1998) for all sapling species was calculated. Sapling species were grouped into associations with respect to their light-demand and their location along the flood-level gradient.Results Average flood height and average rPAR at the forest floor was highest in the secondary stage of the low varzea and lowest in the high-varzea forest. Overall average density and basal area of the saplings averaged 2250 individuals and 2.3 m(2) ha(-1) in the secondary stage, 2330 individuals and 2.6 m(2) ha(-1) in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and 5000 individuals and 4.8 m(2) ha(-1) in the high varzea. In all forest types, species richness of saplings was lower than species richness of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h., and amounted to 25 species in the secondary stage, to 35 species in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and to 88 species in the high-varzea forest. The amount of 'immigrants' (Bazzaz, 1991) at the sapling level increased with proceeding forest succession and amounted to 24 and 29% in the low varzea and to 31% in the high varzea. Sapling species distribution, species richness and individual density was linked to both, the gradient of flooding and the gradient of irradiation. Species richness and individual density was highest in the high varzea and decreased with increasing influence of flooding. The high varzea was predominated by pronounced shade-tolerant sapling species, whereas in the low varzea occured both, light demanding and shade-tolerant species groups.Main conclusions Influence of flooding seems to be the main factor triggering species composition and structure of sapling communities in varzea forests. Proceeding forest succession reduces the impact of flooding because of the biogenical induced silting up of the forested sites. However, forest succession also alters forest architecture of the overstory and such the light conditions at the sapling level. Therefore, radiation is an important factor influencing species composition of sapling communities in varzea forests.

TI  - Restoration through trenches does not demand organic fertilization and sawdust coverage on plant establishment
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration in post-open pit mining areas is complex and faces the challenge of "recreating" the soil under horizontal disruption, representing strong barriers to root growth. Hence, trenches (paths opened by digging) for planting are an alternative to improve root development conditions and plant growth. This study aimed to evaluate growth of six tree species planted in trenches under three treatments: Topsoil or control (CT), Sawdust (SD), and Cow manure (CM). The trenches (1 m in height and length by 40 m long) were filled with topsoil. In the 6-m space between trenches, two treatments were performed: soil covered and not covered by sawdust to test natural regeneration. Six tree species (250 individuals) in pits over trenches where mortality, mean annual increment in height (MAIHt,), diameter (MAIDSH), and crown area (MAICA) were assessed. Natural regeneration and litter stock were also evaluated. After 18 months, mortality was zero, except Byrsonima spicata with less than 5% in CT, SD, and CM. Clitoria fairchildiana, Tachigali vulgaris, and Croton matourensis showed highest MAIHt and MAIDSH, and C. fairchildiana presented the highest MAICA with no statistical differences among treatments. Sawdust coverage had no effects on litter amounts and on tree species from the natural regeneration. Herbs and grasses covered 45.5% and 57.2% of the soil with and without sawdust. Based on growth and mortality, C. fairchildiana, T. vulgaris, and C. matarensis can be recommended for initial restoration after kaolin mining.

TI  - Can the dynamics of forest restoration reduce landscape fragmentation in the Atlantic forest?
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the landscape changes in two forest restoration areas: one adjacent to remaining forest fragments (AA) and the other non-adjacent Brazil. The areas have been previously used for sugarcane cultivation and have undergone restoration interventions involving planting over 30 native species. The satellite images used were from 2011, 2015, and 2019, allowing for the analysis of changes in vegetation cover and landscape fragmentation. The results indicate that both areas experienced an increase in vegetation cover over time, as evidenced by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, adjacent to forest fragments, the AA area exhibited greater ecological connectivity and less fragmentation, resulting in a large forest fragment from 2015 onwards. On the other hand, the non-adjacent ANA area showed slower progress but managed to form a large fragment by 2019, thanks to the presence of planted species such as Mimosa caesalpiniifolia. Moreover, the analysis of fragmentation metrics revealed a reduction in the division index in both areas, which was more pronounced in AA. The supervised classification of the images indicated changes in the restoration areas and their surroundings, with the expansion of classes such as Forest and Exposed. The results highlight the importance of functional connectivity between forest fragments, especially in areas adjacent to remaining fragments, which can accelerate the restoration process and reduce fragmentation. Active restoration, through planting high-density native species, proved effective in rehabilitating forest cover. This study suggests that forest restoration in anthropized areas can mitigate fragmentation, with effects observable in less than a decade, particularly when connecting existing fragments. These findings underscore the importance of implementing restoration strategies that foster connectivity between forest fragments and of continuously monitoring fragmentation metrics to evaluate the efficacy of restoration actions.

TI  - Key leaf traits indicative of photosynthetic plasticity in tropical tree species
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The main achievement of this work was an attempt to determine the best association between five tropical species and light environments, based on the physiological and morphological characters related to photosynthesis.Information about light tolerance and photosynthetic plasticity of indigenous tropical tree species is still limited, particularly information of first years of plants' development. In this study, we evaluated the adjustments in response to different light environments of 25 leaf traits most commonly assessed in studies on light acclimation of photosynthesis in current literature. This evaluation was used to investigate the photosynthetic plasticity on young plants of five tropical tree species belonged to different successional groups. All the species are commonly used in forest restoration programs in Brazil. Plants were grown for 6 months under different light conditions simulating environments that could exist due to variation in naturally occurring canopy openings of secondary tropical forests. The level of adjustment on leaf traits to environmental conditions was calculated via a plasticity index. The relation between leaf trait adjustments and species photosynthetic plasticity was investigated by multivariate Biplot analyses. We selected the seven most explicative leaf traits of the photosynthetic plasticity of the studied species in response to different light environments: dark respiration rate (R (d)), Rubisco carboxylation capacity (V (cmax)), total chlorophyll content (ChlT), contribution of spongy parenchyma (%SP), contribution of leaf collenchyma tissue (%C), chlorophyll parenchyma thickness (PP/SP) and specific leaf area (SLA). Based on the selected traits, we identified the traits most related to high plasticity (V (cmax), PP/SP, %SP, %C and SLA) and low plasticity (V (cmax), R (d) and ChlT) and grouped species into three different patterns of photosynthetic plasticity. Our plasticity grouping was not correlated with species successional classification, indicating the importance of including physiological features related to light tolerance in species successional classifications. This work provides complementing information to traditional species successional groupings and to our current ability to select species for enrichment planting on restoration efforts.

TI  - Environmental control of seed dormancy and germination of Mimosa calodendron (Fabaceae): implications for ecological restoration of a highly threatened environment
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rupestrian grasslands over ironstone outcrop, locally named canga, are montane ecosystems with restricted distribution known to harbor an unusually a large number of endemic plant species. These communities are highly threatened due to their high sensitivity to habitat conversions and extreme low resilience derived from anthropogenic pressure. Ecological restoration attempts on degraded rupestrian grassland areas have not yet been successful. Mimosa calodendron is an endemic canga shrub thought to play a facilitator role and, therefore, may enhance seedling recruitment in degraded areas. Since dormancy and slow germination are key factors of the biology of seeds and may hamper their use in ecological restoration, this study aimed to investigate the environmental control of seed dormancy and germination of M. calodendron seeds. We tested the effect of mechanical scarification, light and different incubation temperatures on seed germination. The effect of scarification on water uptake by seeds was also measured. M. calodendron seeds have physical dormancy and scarification was an effective treatment to promote high and rapid germination. Heat treatment also increased germination percentage of non-scarified seeds, but was less efficient than scarification. Once water uptake occurred, germination took place under a broad thermal gradient, regardless of light condition. Therefore, the germination profile of M. calodendron seems to be suitable for uncomplicated use in restoration projects, requiring only a pretreatment for dormancy release.

TI  - Ecological succession in areas degraded by bauxite mining indicates successful use of topsoil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian ironstone outcrops (cangas) are nutrient-poor stressful habitat dominated by slow-growing woody species with high biodiversity and unique evolutionary history. Mining has produced great impacts on this ecosystem. Spontaneous regeneration of abandoned canga mined areas has not been observed. One of the active methods most widely used for ecological restoration in environments where soil has been lost or severely degraded is topsoil transposition due to the physical, chemical, and microbiological improvement of the substrate, in addition to the seed bank. Thus, plant succession was monitored for 40 months after topsoil transposition in a canga area degraded by aluminum mining, without any other type of management. A completely randomized design with 70 permanent plots (1 x 1 m) was used. Annual phytosociological surveys were carried out and floristic and vegetational spectra were constructed with the life-forms proposed by Raunkiaer. Floristic composition was compared with a reference site. Overall, 105 species were identified. Both flora and vegetation changed over time, increasing resemblance to the reference areas. The floristic and vegetational spectra after 4 years of topsoil deposition are similar to pristine ones. The vegetation spectrum showed an increase in the dominance of phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes, while therophytes reduced their proportion. The early successional stage is dominated by weeds, like in other canga restoration studies, but did not impede the native species regeneration. Cangas's species recruited well from transposed topsoil. Unlike other studies with fertilized topsoil, our findings show the efficiency of topsoil transposition to provide initial conditions for the ecological restoration of this ecosystem.

TI  - Post-fire forest restoration in the humid tropics: A synthesis of available strategies and knowledge gaps for effective restoration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Humid tropical forests are increasingly exposed to devastating wildfires. Major efforts are needed to prevent fire-related tipping points and to enable the effective recovery of fire-affected areas. Here, we provide a synthesis of the most common forest restoration strategies, thereby focusing on post-fire forest dynamics in the humid tropics. A variety of restoration strategies can be adopted in restoring humid tropical forests, including natural regeneration, assisted natural regeneration (i.e. fire breaks, weed control, erosion control, topsoil replacement, peatland rewetting), enrichment planting (i.e. planting nursery-raised seedlings, direct seeding) and commercial restoration ( i.e. plantation forests, agroforestry). Our analysis shows that while natural regeneration can be effective under favourable ecological conditions, humid tropical forests are often ill-adapted to fire, and therefore less likely to recover unassisted after a wildfire event. Active restoration practices may be more effective, but can be costly and challenging to implement. We also identify gaps in knowledge needed for effective restoration of humid tropical forests after fire, hereby taking into account the ecosystems and socio-economic conditions in which these fires occur. We suggest to incorporate fire severity in future studies, to better understand and predict post-fire ecosystem responses. In addition, as fire poses a recurring and intensifying threat throughout the recovery process, more emphasis should be placed on post- restoration management and the prevention of fire throughout the different phases of the restoration process. Furthermore, as tropical wildfires are increasing in scale, establishing collaborative capacity and setting priorities for efficient resource allocation should become a major priority for restoration practitioners in the humid tropics. Finally, as global fire regimes are changing and expected to intensify in the context of climate change, land use and land cover change, we suggest to put continuous effort into fire monitoring and modelling to inform the development of effective restoration strategies in the long-run.

TI  - Trema micrantha (L.) Blume. IN PLANTATIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION: EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN THE BRAZILIAN SUBTROPICAL FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of silviculture of native species in a determined region is fundamental for the selection of more appropriate species for using in ecological restoration. Trema micrantha (Cannabaceae), a pioneer species which is widely distributed, shading and attractive to birds, is intensively planted in restoration projects of the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In order to get information regarding to the performance of this species in subtropical forests (subject to the yearly frosts), we analyzed its early growth in a planting carried out with 70 native tree species in 3 x 2 m spacing in four plots of 40 x 54 m. Semiannually, we collected data of 72 individuals of Trema micrantha. These data were statistically analyzed using the Statistical Software Assistat-beta submitted to Tukey test (p<0.05) and graphically described by R. Trema micrantha showed excellent performance at 3.5 years of age in root collar diameter (12.01 +/- 5.24 cm), total height (5.95 +/- 1.44 m), crown projection area (22.56 +/- 11.26 m(2)) and crown volume (61.34 +/- 37.46 m(3)), enduring severe frosts with a yearly survival rate of 78%. Based on the results obtained, and considering that this species has broad natural distribution, we recommend its extensive use also in forestry restoration projects in the subtropical regions of Brazil.

AB  - The successful establishment of tree species in pastures may be related to the species used, germination conditions, and seed size. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments: pre-hydration and different kinds of seed coverage in eight native species with different seed sizes and verify if these species would be able to produce 1,666 individual ha(-1) after one year. Five of the eight species tested had potential for large-scale use with the higher germination rate for the small seeds. The pre-hydration of the seeds was not efficient in increasing the germination and in the establishment of species, but coverage with straw and soil showed important results. The best result was obtained with the treatment of seed coverage with soil without hydration, with the establishment of 3,817 seedlings ha-1 after one year.

TI  - Time-lag in biological responses to landscape changes in a highly dynamic Atlantic forest region
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-lagged responses of biological variables to landscape modifications are widely recognized, but rarely considered in ecological studies. In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000-2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning.

TI  - Optimal temperature and energy efficiency in the germination of Moringa oleifera Lam.: Implications for use in ecological restoration programs in degraded areas
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moringa oleifera Lam. is a species with significant potential for use in restoration programs in degraded areas. The species is used in folk medicine, water purification, as forage, as a condiment, among other ends, and has the ability to create an environment conducive to the establishment of other species. However, low seed germination rates and limited vegetative propagation are important challenges. Temperature stands out among the variables that have a strong impact on the germination of seeds of this species. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of temperature on the germination of M. oleifera seeds in order to determine the ideal thermal range and calculate the net energy (enthalpy) change of activation of germination, in addition to the thermal implications for the establishment of this plant in degraded areas under ecological restoration. To this end, an experiment was conducted using six seed batches collected in an Atlantic Forest environment in Northeastern Brazil from the 2020 and 2021 harvests. The seeds were subjected to constant temperatures of 5 to 40 degrees C. Analyses were performed to evaluate seed germination parameters. Regression analyses were performed to explore the relationships between variables, the net energy variation to understand the energy availability during germination, and a Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify patterns and reduce data dimensionality. The seeds of M. oleifera germinated between 10 and 40 degrees C, and the optimal temperature was 26 degrees C. The highest germination speed index (GSI) values were observed between 30 and 35 degrees C, with the optimal temperature of 28 degrees C for this variable, which promoted rapid and uniform germination. The energy change (Delta H61/4) was 11.29 Kcal/mol at 25 degrees C, 9.65 Kcal/mol at 30 degrees C, and 10.78 Kcal/mol at 35 degrees C. Therefore, optimal temperatures for germination (from 25 to 35 degrees C) favor rapid and uniform germination, essential for the success use of the species in environmental restoration programs.

TI  - FRUIT YIELD AND MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi., IN LOWER REGION OF SAN FRANCISCO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest species with economic potential, such as aroeira (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi.), require selection of individuals with superior characteristics for use in forest restoration projects and for establishment of commercial plantations. These plantations can contribute to the sustainability of natural populations of species in the remaining forest fragments, in areas of permanent preservation, legal reserves or other areas of ecological significance. It was evaluated the fruits' yield, morphometry and viability of seeds from 15 individuals of aroeira, collected in different fragments in the region of Lower Sao Francisco river, Sergipe State. The fruit yield was estimated by Fornier's intensity index, and the morphometric characteristics were obtained with a digital paquimeter and analytical balance. The viability and vigor were evaluated by germination percentage and germination speed index (GSI), under controlled conditions. The results of fruit yield were subjected to variance analysis, and the means were compared by Tukey (p < 0.05). The other variables means were compared by Scott-Knott test (p<0.05). The individuals differed in Fournier's indices (indices 1, 2, 3 and 4) and in the size of fruits and seeds. The germination varied from 0 to 83% and the GSI from 0.00 to 0.98. The phenotypic differences observed among individuals for fruit yield, and morphophysiological characteristics can be used in forest restoration and establishment of provenances/progenies tests, aiming discrimination of superior material for future commercial plantations.

TI  - Heterogeneous impacts of community forestry on forest conservation and poverty alleviation: Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Community forestry is a participatory approach aiming to achieve sustainable forest management while also reducing poverty among rural communities. Yet, evidence of the impacts of community forestry programmes on both forest conservation and poverty alleviation is scarce, and there is limited understanding of impacts across different social and biophysical contexts. We applied a matching method to assess the extent to which deforestation has decreased and village well-being has improved as a result of Indonesia's community forestry scheme, Hutan Desa (Village Forest). We assessed five dimensions of well-being: basic (living conditions), physical (access to health and education), financial (income support), social (security and equity) and environmental (natural hazard prevention). We found that Hutan Desa was associated with reduced deforestation and poverty. 'Win-win' outcomes were found in 51% of cases, comprising (a) positive outcomes for both forests and poverty, (b) a positive outcome for one aspect and a negligible outcome for the other, or (c) a positive outcome for poverty in areas where natural forest had already been lacking prior to Hutan Desa tenure. Benefits to forests and people systematically differed depending on land-use zones, reflecting subtle interactions between anthropogenic pressures and community livelihood characteristics. In Watershed Protection Zones, which are dominated by subsistence-based forest livelihoods, community forestry provided mild conservation benefits, but resulted in the greatest improvements in well-being through improved land tenure. In Limited Production Zones, community forestry provided modest benefits for both conservation and well-being because restrictions on timber harvest due to Hutan Desa designation reduced the financial well-being of logging communities. The greatest conservation benefits were experienced in Permanent or Convertible Production Zones, but well-being improvements were minimal. Here, living conditions and environmental well-being were reduced due to pressure to intensify agricultural production under increased land scarcity in these predominantly cash crop-oriented communities. Our results highlight the spatial and contextual variation in impacts of community forestry policies on poverty alleviation and forest conservation outcomes. Crucially, our study provides vital objective information for future policy development in Indonesia and other tropical countries implementing community forestry schemes.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ECOLOGICAL PREFERENCES OF Clidemia urceolata DC. ON DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of preferential habitats of species which spontaneously colonize disturbed areas can constitute elements to improve ecological restoration techniques. Therefore, Clidemia urceolata DC stands out for colonizing those environments and presenting wide distribution in the watershed of Paraiba do Sul River. The objective of this study was to evaluate ecological preferences of C. urceolata in the watershed of Barra Mansa River, RJ (22 degrees 32' 40 '' 22 degrees 40' 60 '' S and 44 degrees 12' 44 degrees 06' 20 '' W). The species nuclei were delimited and classified according to the following environmental factors: terrain feature, relative position on toposequence, exposition face, slope and altitude. It was sampled 26 nuclei, totalizing 0.005 ha from 6.839 ha of total area. Species distribution was more frequent on the following conditions: a) medium and inferior thirds of the toposequence. b) concave face of the terrains. c) southeastern, southern and southwestern exposure faces. d) slope between 8 and 45%. e) altitudes between 432 and 525 m, being the four last factors the most determinant. The conjunction of this information ploted for the watershed of Barra Mansa River indicate that 30% of area present more favorable conditions for the establishment of C. urceolata, what can demonstrate an environmental restoration potential.

TI  - Uncovering data gaps in biodiversity research within Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration.
T2  - Restoration Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Bringing together and synthesizing data from several primary studies and scales represents a powerful method for identifying patterns and gaps within forest restoration science. In this study, we employ a pioneer quantitative database-driven review combined with spatial analysis to delineate research trends across biodiversity studies within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). We gathered a total of 90 primary studies that met our inclusion criteria, collectively providing 822 observations (comparisons between restoration sites and reference forests) spanning restoration areas with ages ranging from 1 to 90 years old. Vascular plants and invertebrates dominated in terms of data availability, whereas soil microorganisms were the subject of limited inquiry. There is an evident disparity in the number of evidences for different forest types across regions, with mixed forest being underrepresented in relation to seasonal forest and dense forest (rainforest). On the contrary, we observed an even distribution of biodiversity outcomes across the age categories we defined for reference forests (i.e. secondary forest, secondary advanced, and old-growth forest). Geospatial analysis revealed a concentration of research efforts within the southeastern region of the BAF. However, a significant research deficit remains for the northeast and south regions, crucial for comprehending biodiversity responses to restoration in environmental extremes. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this framework review provides a roadmap for deepening our understanding of biodiversity responses to restoration in the BAF. Ultimately, it serves as a bridge between quantitative findings and nuanced contextual insights, guiding future research and similar studies across diverse ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - DNA Metabarcoding Reveals Cryptic Diversity in Forest Soils on the Isolated Brazilian Trindade Island, South Atlantic
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats. However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi, Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon. Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute to ecological restoration efforts on the island.

TI  - Tree species direct sowing for forest restoration
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The direct sowing to tropical forest restoration can be viable when the ecological and silvicultural aspects of species are known. This work evaluated the effect of breaking seed dormancy and a physical protector on the initial growth of riparian tree species. The experiment was carried out in a randomized blocks design, in a factorial (2x2), with four blocks and four plots for each treatment. The treatment to break seed dormancy used were: immersion in sulphuric acid for 20 minutes and washing in water for I hour plus soaking for 24 hours for Trema micrantha; immersion in boiling water (100 degrees C) with following soaking until refreshing for 24 hours to Senna multijuga and Senna macranthera and pre-soaking in water for 2 hours for Solanum granuloso-leprosum. The physical protector used was a transparent plastic cup (500mL). The breaking seed dormancy used was efficient in laboratory, except for S. macranthera. In field conditions, it was efficient only for S. multijuga and S. macranthera. The physical protector did not presented any benefit for the studied tree species regarding seedlings emergence and survival, but it provided significant differences in height and base diameter for S. multijuga and in height for S. macranthera after three months. After 24 months, T micrantha presented the highest values for height and basal diameter. S. macranthera presented the height relative growth and T micrantha the highest basal diameter. The studied species can be recommended for ecological forest restoration, using direct sowing.

TI  - The effectiveness of lidar remote sensing for monitoring forest cover attributes and landscape restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambitious pledges to restore over 400 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030 have been made by several countries within the Global Partnership for Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR). Monitoring restoration outcomes at this scale requires cost-effective methods to quantify not only forest cover, but also forest structure and the diversity of useful species. Here we obtain and analyze structural attributes of forest canopies undergoing restoration in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using a portable ground lidar remote sensing device as a proxy for airbome laser scanners. We assess the ability of these attributes to distinguish forest cover types, to estimate aboveground dry woody biomass (AGB) and to estimate tree species diversity (Shannon index and richness). A set of six canopy structure attributes were able to classify five cover types with an overall accuracy of 75%, increasing to 87% when combining two secondary forest classes. Canopy height and the unprecedented "leaf area height volume" (a cumulative product of canopy height and vegetation density) were good predictors of AGB. An index based on the height and evenness of the leaf area density profile was weakly related to the Shannon Index of tree species diversity and showed no relationship to species richness or to change in species composition. These findings illustrate the potential and limitations of lidar remote sensing for monitoring compliance of FLR goals of landscape multifunctionality, beyond a simple assessment of forest cover gain and loss.

TI  - Seed rain as an ecological indicator of forest restoration in the Pampa biome
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated seed rain in different forest formation soil uses in the Serra do Sudeste region, Pampa biome. Four area were selected: active restoration (Area 1), passive restoration (Area 2), eucalyptus commercial plantation (Area 3) and native forest (Area 4). Ten permanent collectors of 1 m(2) each were installed in each area, being suspended 1 meter above the soil surface. Collections were made monthly for twelve months in 2018. The analyzed variables were: the number of morphospecies, number of individuals, the indices of Margalef richness, Pielou evenness, Shannon diversity, Jaccard floristic similiarity, and possible correlations by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Total number of seeds sampled during the period was 239,988, distributed across 116 morphospecies. The area under active restoration (Area 1) did not differ statistically by the Kruskall-Wallis test (p < 0.05) of the native forest (Area 4) for the number of seeds. Area 1 presented a higher number of morphospecies and greater diversity of species, followed by Area 4. Seed rain can be a promising ecological indicator for the conditions of the present study.

TI  - Survival in nursery of native species saplings obtained from natural regeneration of forest fragments
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Seedling survival was evaluated regarding transplanted saplings obtained from natural regeneration of a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragment, located at Bofete, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Shrub and trees species seedlings up to 30 cm height were collected from samples sited on a forest remnant, transplanted to a nursery under 50% shade tissue, and evaluated periodically during nine months. A total of 2,424 seedlings, belonging to 110 species were transferred to the nursery. Average survival reached 69%, although this survival rate was quite variable according to the species, families and height classes of the evaluated individuals. In spite of the fact that pioneer species presented higher survival rate, several non-pioneer species also obtained high values of survival. Besides, many of the survivor species are usually not available in forest nurseries of the Sao Paulo State. The transference of seedlings from natural regeneration of forest fragments to forest nurseries seems to be a complementary and a viable method in order to produce saplings of native species, increasing diversity within nurseries with forest restoration purposes.

TI  - Assessment of ecological indicators in restoration by applied nucleation with different ages
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring through good ecological indicators is still a challenge in assessing the results of ecological restoration in Brazil. In this sense, the aim of this work was to evaluate ecological indicators of the restoration process by applied nucleation implanted two years and seven years ago in the south of Brazil. A total of twenty 5 m x 5 m plots were evaluated in each area, arranged systematically under the nuclei. All shrub-tree individuals with height greater than 30 cm were counted and identified. The species were classified according to the dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance. Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness indices were calculated. Canopy coverage was verified by a convex spherical densiometer. Analysis of variance (p<0.05) were used to compare floristic composition, structure and function group indicators between areas. We adjusted simple linear regression models between the area occupation of the nucleus and the richness and number of individuals of natural regeneration to verify the nuclei expansion. The results showed greater richness, diversity and canopy coverage percentage in the area with applied nucleation from seven years. There was a significant difference for composition, structure and function group indicators. The simple linear regression model for the nucleus area as a function of the number of individuals was significant (p<0.05). We concluded that the nuclei implanted seven years ago are being effective for ecological restoration. The post-implantation chronological period should be considered as a variable of influence on the effectiveness of the restoration.

TI  - Pioneer effects on exotic and native tree colonizers: Insights for Araucaria forest restoration
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We integrate analyses of spatial association with empirical measures of juvenile performance to develop a strategy for Araucaria forest restoration in Brazil. Because pioneer species can differentially facilitate or inhibit target species, we measure native Araucaria angustifolia and exotic hints taeda responses to two common pioneer species, Baccharis uncinella and Vernonia discolor in a clear-cut pine plantation. P taeda establishment and growth was greater than that of A. angustifolia in all treatments, showing its potential for invasiveness. B. uncinella showed significant positive spatial associations with P. taeda and negative spatial associations with A. angustifolia. V discolor showed significant negative spatial associations with P taeda but neutral spatial associations with A. angustifolia, it also supported a higher diversity of native species under its canopy than B. uncinella. Experimental results show that these patterns are due to differential establishment restrictions imposed by both pioneers on target species. We conclude that B. uncinella promotes pine invasion while V discolor restrains it. We suggest strategies for Araucaria forest restoration and highlight the broad applicability of our approach to restoration programs.

TI  - REDD plus IN BRAZIL: A PROFUSION OF PILOT PROJECTS WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil adopted its first laws on the REDD mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) in 2008. These laws setting out goals and orientations show the importance given by Brazil to this mechanism, now called REDD+ since its scope was widened to include carbon storage in soils and, more generally, "sustainable" tropical forest management. From surveys based on interviews with those involved and field observations supplemented by an analysis of the regulations and the bibliography, this article sets out to elucidate the construction of the REDD+ institutional framework in Brazil, with a description of external financial contributions. Although the institutional framework is still under construction and the national REDD+ strategy still awaiting development and adoption, REDD+ in Brazil is already being received with great enthusiasm, as illustrated by numerous initiatives from federated States (Amazonas, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) as well as many pilot projects. The regional contexts of these pilot projects show that they are mainly taking place in areas that are already under protection (protected areas or indigenous lands), although they could have focused more particularly on the areas most threatened by deforestation. Looking in particular into the Juma Reserve REDD+ project, this article raises a great many questions, including on governance and the involvement or participation of local populations, on greenhouse gas accounting, on the reality of avoided deforestation and on linkages between the local and national scales.

TI  - Ecological restoration increases conservation of taxonomic and functional beta diversity of woody plants in a tropical fragmented landscape
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration can re-establish plant species populations, enhance forested habitats extension, improve landscape connectivity, and enable biodiversity persistence within a landscape. However, the potential benefits of ecological restoration on beta diversity have never been explored. Here we use field data to investigate, for the first time, if restoration plantings enhance the taxonomic and functional plant beta diversity in a fragmented landscape of the threatened Atlantic forest. Woody species were evaluated for 320 plots established in 18 forest fragments and 14 restoration plantings within a sugarcane production landscape with low forest cover, in southeastern Brazil. Diversity metrics were assessed using the multiple incidence-data version of Hill numbers and were compared among three sets of study sites: fragments, restoration plantings and the two combined. Fragments showed higher levels of alpha diversity and proportional abundance of non-pioneer and animal-dispersed species than restoration plantings. Exotic, pioneer and non-zoochoric species were more abundant in restoration plantings, an expected result considering sites still be in the early or mid-successional stages of development. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity of trees was greatest when both areas were combined. For regenerating plants, however, beta diversity results varied according to species incidence-based frequencies. Although restoration plantings do not result in full recovery of alpha diversity, they can all together complement diversity of forest fragments at the landscape level. The findings indicate two key ecological implications for biodiversity conservation: the critical importance of forest fragments as biodiversity repositories and the positive effect of restoration efforts on landscape-scale diversity in degraded regions. These novel results highlight the importance of species selection for restoration initiatives toward species and functional attributes recognized as significantly reduced or locally rare. Overall, forest fragments and restoration plantings can act synergistically to promote recovery of plant diversity in heavily deforested agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The use of phytosociology in effective evaluation of forest restoration in a Mogi Guacu River degraded floodplain, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study objective was to evaluate the effective revegetation in a Mogi Guagu River degraded floodplain area, located at Luiz Antonio municipality (21 degrees 31'S e 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Two native riparian forest remnants (RIP1 and RIP2) and three 10-year-old reforested areas, planted of native species (R1, R2 and R3), were analyzed by using phytosociological describers of the arboreal stratum (trees with DBH >= 5 cm) as indicators. The arboreal stratum inventory was accomplished by 180 plots (10 x 10 m each), 60 representing every native forest and 20 for every reforested area. A total of 60 arboreal species was recorded, only six species (Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana, Genipa americana, Inga striata, Nectandra megapotamica e Peltophorum dubium) occurring in all the five studied areas. Seventeen species were common to both native forests, and nine species were recorded in all the reforested areas. Sebastiania commersoniana and Guarea macrophylla were recorded in the native forests (RIP1 and RIP2), and Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana and Inga striata occurring in all the reforested areas, were the species that best characterize the physiognomy of local diversity and were the most important among the studied species. The results showed that the rehabilitation of the areas made by the reforestation created conditions to implant forests with similar structures of the adjacent natural remainders. The reforestation with native species performed in the degraded floodplain of Mogi Guagu River, initially with the predomination of invasive grasses, has been effective at the first stage of the ecological restoration process. The reforestation is making possible the natural regeneration of species from the adjacent remnants, what indicates that the similarity between planted forests and the native ones are rising through the time. The phytosociology, accomplished ten years after the planting date, is adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforestation during the restoration process of degradated areas in the Mogi Guagu floodplain.

TI  - HERPETOFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES IN A REGION FROM THE BELEM AREA OF ENDEMISM, PARA STATE, EASTERN AMAZONIA, BRAZIL
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ZOOLOGICA DEL URUGUAY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a list of amphibians and reptiles collected during six field surveys in the municipalities of Tailandia, Tome-Acu and Moju, region of the Belem area of endemism, eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We conducted surveys on several fragments of the Amazon rainforest located in a matrix of palm oil plantations (Elaeis guineensis) and/or old pastures recently removed for new plantations. A total of 108 species, including amphibians (50), turtles (3), crocodiles (2), amphisbaenians (3), lizards (22) and snakes (28) were identified. Our results show a phylogenetic pattern already known for the Amazon, with Hylidae and Leptodactylidae presenting higher species richness among amphibians, Gymnophthalmidae and Teiidae for lizards, and Dipsadidae and Colubridae among snakes. Despite the study areas being inserted within the "arc of deforestation" in northeastern Para state, where fragmented forest can be found in a matrix of palm oil plantations, pastures and regenerating forests, it still harbors a high diversity of reptiles and amphibians. Large-scale, agribusiness palm oil plantations are expanding in the region, and actions are needed to minimize impacts on local fauna. For this, conservation efforts focused on the remaining fragments of forest are crucial to protect the high species diversity still found in the region.

TI  - Establishment success of Brazil nut trees in smallholder Amazon forest restoration depends on site conditions and management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained momentum globally and guidance is needed to identify those species, sites and planting methods that increase restoration success. Incorporating native Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species in FLR approaches provides an opportunity to simultaneously deliver ecological and economic benefits. The Brazil nut tree is one of the most valuable Amazonian NTFP species and could fulfil a cornerstone role in Amazon FLR. However, the factors defining establishment success within Brazil nut restoration activities remain unknown. 2. Here, we evaluate the effect of management practices, restoration site (pastures, agroforestry, secondary forest and canopy gaps in old growth forest) and environmental conditions on the establishment success (tree growth, survival and fruit production) of Brazil nut restoration projects implemented by smallholders in the Peruvian Amazon. We performed a field study at 25 restoration sites of 1-38 years in age, where we conducted measurements on 481 trees and interviewed 21 smallholders. We used mixed effect models to identify drivers of performance. 3. Twenty years after planting, diameter growth in secondary forests was 38%, 34%, and 24% higher than in canopy gaps, pastures, and agroforestry sites, respectively. Survival rate was similar for trees planted in pastures and secondary forests, but 15-20% higher there than trees planted in agroforestry sites, and 7-12% higher than in canopy gaps. Fruit production was 262% higher for reproductive trees in secondary forest sites compared to pastures, but production probability did not differ between restoration sites. These results show that secondary forests are the most suitable sites for planting Brazil nut trees. 4. In addition to restoration site effects, we also found significant effects of management practices. Survival rate increased with application of fire for clearing and weeding and economic investments and decreased with potentially inefficient herbivore protection. Fruit production was lower for trees planted further away from smallholders' homes. These results show that smallholders' management has a substantial effect on establishment success. 5. Our findings suggest a significant importance of post-planting maintenance of trees to increase success of FLR projects. Further, our study shows that evaluation of past restoration activities can guide future forest restoration in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Soil physical properties in Mixed Ombrophilous Forest under passive restoration process
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the physical properties of the soil in forest areas in secondary succession and in the process of passive restoration. The areas belong to the State University of the Midwest of Parana, Guarapuava, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with samples at six points in each area, at depths of 0 - 0.1 m, 0.1 - 0.2 m and 0.2 - 0.3 m. The forest in secondary succession had a greater amount of organic matter, this property acts directly on the other evaluated variables. The area under passive restoration had higher values for soil density, lower total porosity at the three depths and greater resistance to soil penetration, and these results are related to the history of area use. The microporosity did not differ between the studied areas and the macroporosity presented smaller values with only difference in the layer of 0.2 - 0.3 m, due to the presence of roots and decomposition of the litter. The highest value of maximum density was in the area under passive restoration (1.23 Mg m(-3)), with humidity of 0.32 Mg Mg-1, already in the area of forest in secondary succession this value was 1.12 Mg m(-3) and humidity of 0.45 Mg Mg-1, depending on the amount of organic matter that directly influences the reduction of the density. Soil recovery in degraded areas is a slow process, and even after ten years, it was not possible to restore the ideal physical properties in the forest under passive restoration.

TI  - TREE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF 1.8 HA PLOT SAMBOJA RESEARCH FOREST: 28 YEARS AFTER INITIAL FIRE
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeated forest fires highly impact on tree species composition. Forest planning requires information about the current condition of species composition. This paper investigates the current tree composition of natural regeneration after repeated forest fires, regeneration process after repeated fires, and strategy of secondary growth related to ecological restoration issues. Re-observation of the 1.8 hectares permanent plot in Samboja Research Forest was conducted in 2011. All trees with diameters above 10 cm at breast height (DBH) were re-numbered and mapped. Herbarium specimen was collected for species identification. Number of taxon was determined, Important Value Index was calculated, species trait of light response was identified based on the references and dispersion index species was calculated. Results show after twenty eight years initial forest fire, 191 species naturally regenerated in the burnt area. Macaranga gigantea, a light demanding pioneer species of Euphorbiaceae was the most dominant species, followed by Vernonia arborea belonging to Asteraceae. Both, M. gigantea and V. arborea had clumped distribution. Eight species identified survived from repeated fires, are Anthocephalus chinensis, Dipterocarpus cornutus, Diospyros borneensis, Eusideroxylon zwageri, Shorea ovalis, Syzygium borneensis, Pholidocarpus majadum and Vatica umbonata. All surviving species was distributed uniformly in the plot. Dominant pioneer species which has grown after repeated fires indicates that the current condition of burnt forest is in the early succession. Protecting forest, assisting natural regeneration and monitoring dominant species are suggested as activities for the ecological restoration.

TI  - Influence of meteorological variables on the initial growth of seedlings of native forest species in vegetation restoration plantings
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of forest restoration plantations to restore ecosystems and neutralize greenhouse gases is increasing, especially as a way to combat climate change. Research related to the growth of forest species and the influence of the environment should be considered to determine their potential in neutralizing carbon dioxide. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the growth in diameter at ground level and height of six forest species throughout the first year after planting according to meteorological variables. The experiment was conducted in the Carbon Zero Forest, part of the Open Space for Events on the main campus of the Federal University of Vicosa (UFV), Minas Gerais, Brazil. Planting of the 324 seedlings was conducted in December 2019, with 2.0 m x 2.0 m spacing, in a randomized block design. The meteorological characteristics for the year 2020 were obtained through the bulletins of the institution's own automatic station. The current increment in height and diameter was calculated for three-month intervals, per species. The data were subjected to Spearman's non-parametric correlation test. The significant correlations between increments in diameter at ground height and height with climatic variables were weak or moderate. In general, precipitation and maximum absolute temperature positively affected the current increment in height, while global radiation affected them negatively. Precipitation, average temperature and absolute minimum temperature negatively affected the current increment in diameter. The results obtained can help in the elaboration of strategies that promote the restoration of areas according to the adaptability of the species to adverse conditions, aside from potentiating the neutralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Dung beetles can sow: the potential of secondary seed dispersers to assist ecological restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Restoration of disturbed environments in which soil surface layers have been removed is challenging and its success depends on the characteristics of the exposed soil layers and neighbour organisms. Dung beetles are important elements in the restoration of degraded habitats as secondary seed dispersers. 2. In this study, we first assessed how the removal of upper soil layers affected the assemblage of dung beetle compared to adjacent reference areas without soil removal. We also evaluated the efficiency of dung beetles as secondary seed dispersers by experimentally testing their effect on the germination of wolf apple seeds (Solanum lycocarpum). 3. Degraded areas harboured a different dung beetle assemblage compared to the reference area, with a predominance of habitat generalist species. In addition, we found higher abundance and richness of dung beetles in the degraded than in reference areas. Despite dung removal being similar between areas, more seeds were removed in the reference area. 4. Dung beetles, especially rollers, positively influenced the probability of wolf apple seed germination in the degraded environment by up to 5%; germination occurred in 27% of treatments with dung beetle presence and no germination occurred when beetles were excluded. 5. Therefore, promoting the attraction of dung beetles from reference areas, together with other techniques that enhance primary seed dispersion, mainly by mammals and birds, could potentially increase the success of projects to restore areas with degraded soil.

TI  - Green deserts, but not always: A global synthesis of native woody species regeneration under tropical tree monocultures
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial. Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40% and 68% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance (on average 25% and 60% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations, and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. Species-area curves revealed that the number of woody species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598 species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management. Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.In this study, we assessed the woody natural regeneration under tree monocultures reported in studies conducted in the tropical region. We found out that native tree monocultures, tree plantations adjacent to forest remnants, and longer rotation lengths harbor more species, while the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. According to our results, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.image

TI  - Establishing the ecological restoration network in Argentina: from Rio1992 to SIACRE2015
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of the science and practice of restoration ecology in Argentina can be divided into three periods. The first was 1992-2004, characterized by isolated restoration efforts, mostly in arid and dry ecosystems, and engaging specific people in the academic, agro-technological, and private sectors as partially required by national regulations, but also inspired by the 1992 Earth Summit, the 1994 Amendments of the Constitutional Law, and environmental guidelines from investment entities. The second period of 2005-2010 showed significantly greater involvement in international networking and conference contributions. The current period from 2011-present has witnessed rapid advances and national integration. The country's network Red de Restauracion Ecologica de Argentina (REA) was founded in 2012, with seven subnational nodes. In 2014, the 2nd REA symposium was held to determine priority areas for restoration and to generate a National Plan. Public agencies, NGOs and volunteer groups are now actively engaged stakeholders. In 2013 Argentina became a founder member of SIACRE (Sociedad Ibero-Americana y del Caribe para la Restauracion Ecologica) and is organizing SIACRE's 4th international conference (April 2015; Buenos Aires). Restoration ecology in Argentina is ascendant because of long-term efforts related to strengthening democracy, people initiatives, and strong support from SIACRE, SER (Society for Ecological Restoration), SER-Europe, and the national networks of Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. Moreover, Argentina is now the first country to have updated its Civil Code by integrating the environment as a "legal good," which reinforces the citizens' rights to demand the implementation of degradation prevention and/or ecosystem restoration measures.

TI  - Community assembly in harsh environments: the prevalence of ecological drift in the heath vegetation of South America
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Metacommunity dynamics is marked by a gradient ranging from pure ecological determinism to pure stochasticity. This gradient encompasses compositional turnover that is governed by ecological drift, selection and dispersal. Here we estimate the influences of selection, dispersal limitation acting in concert with drift, drift acting alone and homogenizing dispersal on the structure of tropical restinga heath vegetation growing under stressful conditions in north-eastern South America. We hypothesize that if abiotic heterogeneity is strong enough, it could select distinct sets of colonizing species from neighbor ecosystems, with stress sensitive species occupying refuges created by abiotic heterogeneity and stress tolerators dominating the more exposed areas. In this case selection would occur at both biogeographical and local scales. Under its prevalence, we expect selection to have a major signature in the woody plant community structure in a phylogenetic null model. Alternatively, if abiotic heterogeneity is not strong enough to impose significant selection, the environment would be homogeneously stressful for the majority of species, and would be dominated species selected at biogeographical scale only. Under its prevalence, we expect drift to have a major signature in the phylogenetic null model. We used an analytical framework based on phylogenetic and community structure null models to assess the relative importance of ecological processes. We also aimed to characterize the ecosystem features that impose selection and dispersal limitation. We found that 95.1% of turnover in composition is attributable to drift, 2.4% to homogenizing dispersal, 2.1% to selection, and just 0.40% to dispersal limitation, thus confirming our Neutrality hypothesis. As expected, both soil and topographic variables influenced metacommunity structure. However, contrary to our prediction, light availability and vegetation structure were also important. The predominance of coarse spatial patterns correlated to topographic and soil properties suggests that coarse differences in wind exposure and associated vegetation and soil factors represent the main selective forces acting on the studied vegetation. The dominance of drift in the assembly of restinga heath vegetation is likely to result from homogeneously stressful environmental conditions and also from the ongoing colonization process that is taking place in the restinga by immigrants from species-rich neighboring ecosystems.

T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we describe a new low-cost technique to collect plant-inhabiting arthropods at a height of up to 10 m without the need for specialized and complicated methods such as rope climbing or fogging. We present a model to build and apply the technique in a tropical forest understory. This technique is important because it is not only efficient for arthropod collection, it also enables a variety of ecological studies such as stratification, habitat comparison, and species distribution.

TI  - Seed rain in a restoration site and in an adjacent remnant of Seasonal Atlantic Forest
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological succession depends on the seed rain. While the simple arrival of seeds is not assurance of establishment, knowing the seed rain is the first approach to assessing the succession process in sites undergoing forest restoration. For this reason, we sampled the seed rain in a restoration site and in an adjacent seasonal semi-deciduous forest remnant in southern Brazil, in order to describe the process. In each area, 18 seed traps (1 m(2)) were allocated and visited monthly for two years. All seeds trapped were identified, counted and classified by life form, ecological group and dispersal syndrome. The forest remnant presented higher species richness and abundance of propagules than the restoration site. The composition of species also differed between areas. The seed rain of both areas presented a higher proportion of tree and shade-intolerant species. Several non-planted species, possibly dispersed from forest remnant, were recorded in the restoration site. Analysis of the results suggests that the seed rain is not a constraint to succession in the restoration site. However, the site should be monitored in the long term to assess the establishment, and not only the arrival of seeds of late successional species.

TI  - Comparison of leaf litter ant fauna in areas under ecological restoration and secondary forest
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Habitat heterogeneity, ecological interactions, and abiotic characteristics are the factors that structure ant assemblages in terrestrial ecosystems. The anthropogenic actions of degradation and restoration have increased the scenarios and possibilities of response patterns in the face of environmental changes. This study aimed to analyze the community structure of leaf litter ant fauna in areas of the Atlantic rainforest and pasture undergoing the process of ecological restoration in two sampling periods. Data were collected bi-monthly from the installation of pitfall traps, installed from April 2015 to August 2016 and April 2017 to August 2018. The analyses were carried out based on the parameters of community structure and relationships with the microclimate. A total of 2,998 specimens were distributed across seven subfamilies, 26 genera, and 125 species/morphospecies. No differences were observed in species richness between native forest and pasture with nucleation techniques. Significant differences in species composition were observed between native forests and pastures with nucleation techniques. Microclimate was an essential determinant for structuring ant assemblages, discriminating regions where the arboreal component was present and absent. The number of unique species in the native forest area demonstrates the need for fragments in sound conservation stages. Our results support leaf litter ant fauna as a bioindicator for monitoring the restoration of areas degraded by pastures in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil.

TI  - Priority areas for forest restoration aiming at the conservation of water resources
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Allocation of forest in a river basin is a complex management problem, with conditions that may encourage conflict, in particular among groups with different interests, due to the diversity of the objectives. Aiming at the conservation of water resources, the main objective of this study was to assess the performance of Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), a multicriteria decision analysis, in the prioritization of areas for forest restoration. The study area is a Brazilian river basin, originally covered by Atlantic Forest. The relevant criteria to this decision-making process were identified as land-use suitability, soil erodibility, erosivity, proximity to roads, and proximity to surface water. We proposed three order weight sets, based on the decision strategy space, with medium-to-high risk-taking and medium tradeoff among the criteria (OWA1); medium risk-taking and total tradeoff (WLC), representing the traditional Weighted Linear Combination method; and medium-to-low risk-taking and medium tradeoff among the criteria (OWA2). Then, using an OWA operator (as a GIS routine), we produced maps for the three solutions, which were reclassified in five priority levels (very low, low, medium, high and very high). We did the cross tabulation among the solutions, for areas classified as high and very-high priority, and some environmental characteristics, intrinsically related to the criteria: land-use/land-cover, soil erodibility, distance from the surface water, soils and slope. WLC resulted in 54% of the Corumbatai river basin with high priority to forest restoration; 37% with very-high priority; and 9% with medium priority, and the spatial distribution of classes was intrinsically related to two main criteria: proximity to surface water and soil erodibility. OWA1 resulted in one alternative with 80% of the basin classified as very-high priority to forest restoration and 20% as high priority. Such classes' distribution is the result of the distribution of order weights, to obtain the desired risk level. In OWA2, due to the distribution of order weights among the criteria, the prioritization of areas occurred differently from the previous alternatives, with no predominance of one or more criteria. Under this scenario, the river basin presented 1% of this area with very low priority for forest restoration; 17% with low; 63% with medium; 10% with high; and 9% with very-high priority. OWA is suitable for the prioritization of areas, once it allows us to control the criteria influence on the final solution, through the tradeoff. This implies, however, the method's ability to normalize the criteria to a continuous scale, since the categorization in the criteria maps affects the spatial distribution of the alternatives.

TI  - SELECTION OF SPECIES FROM NATURAL FOREST AND INDICATION OF PLANTING DENSITY FOR RECLAMATION OF DEGRADED AREAS IN THE AMAZON FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of species influencing the occurrence of other associated species is of fundamental importance for the success of forest restoration of degraded areas. The objective of this work is to present a phytosociological and socioeconomic index (IFSE), obtained by techniques of factor analysis, modeling six quantitative variables (abundance, frequency, dominance, biomass, the commercial value of timber and amount of non-timber forest products) and equal number of qualitative variables, whose dummy variable is equal to one, assumed value for those species whose higher earnings amounted to 50 % of the total for each quantitative variables analyzed. Sampling of the dense rain forest (407 ha) was composed by 80 plots of 0.25 ha (4.91 % of sampling intensity) and all individuals with diameter at 1.30 m above the ground (DBH) >= 10 cm were identified and measured. It was recorded 10,105 individuals, including 493 species covering 58 families. The species were ranked by the index proposed in three categories of priority phytosociological and socioeconomic status (high, medium and low). The appropriateness of factor analysis was determined by tests of Bartlett and KMO. The Bartlett's test evaluated the overall significance of the correlation matrix and indicated that correlations were significant at 1 % probability. The KMO test showed that the variables were correlated and the model of variance showed a very good level of fitness to the data. These results endorsed the use of factor analysis to extract factors and estimate the factor scores. The results were statistically validated for construction of the index IFSE and 25 species were selected as the priority ones (key species). And also, it was recomended the planting density for these forest species for restoration of degraded areas in Amazonia.

TI  - Effects of Vegetation on Bird Communities and Bird-Plant Interactions in Urban Green Areas of Riparian Forests in Brazil That Have Undergone Ecological Restoration
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization replaces natural vegetation for city expansion, impacting environmental and climatic variables that affect the health of the human population and fauna. These changes affect important groups such as birds, given their greater sensitivity to anthropogenic alterations, especially when we understand these effects on a large scale, considering countries such as Brazil, which represents the third country with the greatest diversity of bird species in the world. Conversely, green spaces like urban parks, tree-lined avenues, and riparian forests seem to foster biodiversity conservation. Here, we analyze the effects of vegetation on bird communities and bird-plant interactions in urban riparian areas that have undergone ecological restoration. The study was carried out between January and October 2019 in two restored urban areas of Uberl & acirc;ndia, Brazil. Results showed that the richness of birds observed between the two areas was Praia Clube (n = 86) and Parque Linear Rio Uberabinha (n = 80). The most representative trophic guilds in the areas, with the highest proportion in their relative abundances during both seasons, were granivores, omnivores, insectivores, and frugivores. Composition varied significantly between areas as a function of the plant community, particularly when considering the interaction between season and area (ANOSIM: R = 0.19; Stress = 0.10; p = 0.008). In environments dominated by generalist and synanthropic species (Eared Dove, Picazuro Pigeon), effective planning and management of green areas are crucial. It is important to acknowledge that certain bird species depend on specific habitats, such as riparian forests, and that specific plant species within these areas are vital for specialized bird species, such as species endemic to the Brazilian Savanna or Cerrado and restricted to Brazil (White-striped Warbler) and species in vulnerable categories globally (Bare-faced Curassow). Therefore, restoration efforts in degraded areas should be carefully planned to restore interactions and conserve biodiversity effectively.

TI  - A seed rain community in a reforested post-agricultural field and adjacent secondary forest of Mount Papandayan Nature Reserve, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms and barriers to the restoration of degraded land, especially post agriculture, will help provide protocols on effective ways of restoration into functional ecosystems. One of the barriers in early stages of forest restoration is the arrival and availability of propagules. Seed rain and factors affecting it (i.e., distance to the forest edge, species diversity and surrounding vegetation) were measured in a reforested post-agricultural field and in an adjacent secondary forest. Multivariate glm analysis was used on the seed rain community data and univariate lm analysis on the most abundant seed captured (i.e., Schima wallichii (DC.) Korth.). After 8 months of seed rain collection, there was a total of 3596 seeds from eight tree species. Seeds were more abundant and more diverse in the secondary forest (74.9%, 8 species) compared to the reforested field (24.1%, 2 species). There was a limitation on seed dispersal in reforested field from the adjacent forest. The abundance of S. wallichii seeds determined by the dominance of adult trees (136 trees/ha in the forest and 115 trees/ha in the reforested field). Our study suggests, that after 7 years of planting, the reforested field has received limited seed rain and has not yet recovered.

TI  - Evaluation of eligible areas for forest CDM projects implementation in the Pardo River basin, in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - An instrument for climate changes mitigation was proposed in Kyoto Protocol, ratified in 1997 - the Clean Development Mechanism - CDM - through which developed countries can meet their emission reduction goals by forestry projects financing in developing countries. For this, the starting point is to assess the CO2 sequestration potential of the eligible areas. In this sense, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the CO2 sequestration potential and carbon credits generation through forestry CDM projects in the Pardo river basin, Minas Gerais state. The methodology consisted of mapping the eligible and suitable areas for projects implementation, through orbital images multitemporal analysis, and the simulation of forest restoration and reforestation scenarios with eucalyptus species. For forest restoration projects, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 10,215,818 Mg, in 20 years, which could generate more than US $ 102,000,000 in carbon credits. For reforestation, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 12,000,000 Mg in six years, and would generate about US $ 120,000,000. A mixed scenario, with projects in both modalities, was considered ideal for the basin and the proposed methodology is feasible for prospective evaluation, and can be consolidated using local biomass parameters.

We attempted to answer three questions: (1) Is P. trichopodum dependent on pollinators and mates for reproduction? (2) What are the pollinators of P. trichopodum? (3) Do tree flower-density and flowering-tree density of P. trichopodum enhance the visitation rate of focal trees and their flowers? We tested the breeding system through pollination treatments. We performed focal observations on 10 trees and analyzed the relationship between tree and flower visitation rates, and the tree flower-density and flowering-tree density with Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). Pleroma trichopodum sets fruits by selfing and outcrossing, both of which occur only through pollinator visits. Bees visited P. trichopodum, and their visitation increased with tree flower-density. Thus, individuals with greater floral displays may function as magnet species, enhancing the pollination of nearby plant species:lhis characteristic, allied with the ability to reproduce without a mate (selfing) and a tolerance of soggy soils, make P. trichopodum a candidate for Atlantic Forest restoration.

TI  - Ecological restoration in Brazilian biomes: Identifying advances and gaps
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The Bonn challenge aims at the restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded ladscapes by 2030. In Brazil, the restoration goal for 2030 is 12 million hectares. Despite the great demand for ecological restoration across the whole of Brazil, there have been no analyses of the studies carried out in different biomes. In addition, conservation efforts must cover all biomes, so that different regions can take advantage of the many benefits of restoration. Our aim was to identify advances and gaps in current restoration knowledge in order to guide future efforts in Brazil. Our bibliometric survey in the Web of Science using 23 keywords related to restoration generated a total of 530 papers, of which 291 were included in the analysis. The papers were published in 121 scientific journals between 1988 and 2018, with the largest number of papers in 2016. The Atlantic Forest was the biome with the highest number of studies, as it is one of the most threatened tropical forest regions in the world and maintains the largest number of research institutions and receives the highest level of funding support in the country. Regarding the types of studies, temporal monitoring was more frequent in the Amazon, Cerrado, Castings, and Pampa, while the monitoring at one point in time was more frequent in the Atlantic Forest. From the studies examined, 31% used a reference area for comparing restoration success. The most studied organisms were plants (81%), and among them, trees were the most frequent, followed by fungi, birds, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles. The pre-restoration degradation differed among biomes, with deforestation for logging the most cited in the Amazon, agriculture, and livestock in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, logging and cattle ranching in Caatinga, and livestock in the Pampa and Pantanal. In general, active/assisted natural succession was the most frequent restoration process: planting seedlings more readily occurred in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Caatinga, whereas natural regeneration in the Cerrado and Pantanal and sowing in Pampa. The studies varied among the age of restoration ( > 1 to 67 years for active restoration and > 1 to 120 years for passive/unassisted natural succession), and the number of species planted (1 to 121 species). We identified an important regional knowledge gap for the Pantanal, Caatinga, and Pampa, as well as the need to include reference areas, evaluate different restoration techniques (besides planting seedlings), and the inclusion of other taxa and life forms in biodiversity studies apart from trees. We also identified the need to expand research to assess landscape metrics, prioritization, legislation, and public policies.

TI  - The value of private properties for the conservation of biodiversity in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas set aside for conservation within private lands may be key to enhancing biodiversity-friendly landscapes. This conservation strategy should be especially effective in highly threatened regions that are poorly protected by public lands, such as the Brazilian Cerrado. Brazil's Native Vegetation Protection Law has included set-aside areas within private properties, but their relevance to conservation has not been evaluated. We assess whether private lands are contributing to biodiversity in the Cerrado, a global biodiversity conservation priority and major region for food production, where land use conflicts are often at odds with conservation objectives. We determined that private protected areas accommodate up to 14.5% of threatened vertebrate species ranges, which increases to 25% when considering the distribution of remaining native habitat. Moreover, the spatial spread of private protected areas benefits a large number of species. Ecological restoration of private protected lands would improve the benefits of this protection system, especially in the Southeastern Cerrado, where a large economic hub meets a threat hotspot.

TI  - Deforestation Simplifies Understory Bird Seed-Dispersal Networks in Human-Modified Landscapes.
T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by land-use changes through human activities. This is mainly due to the conversion of continuous forests into forest fragments surrounded by anthropogenic matrices. In general, sensitive species are lost while species adapted to disturbances succeed in altered environments. However, whether the interactions performed by the persisting species are also modified, and how it scales up to the network level throughout the landscape are virtually unknown in most tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Here we evaluated how landscape predictors (forest cover, total core area, edge density, inter-patch isolation) and local characteristics (fruit availability, vegetation complexity) affected understory birds seed-dispersal networks in 19 forest fragments along the hyperdiverse but highly depauperate northeast distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Also, our sampled sites were distributed in two regions with contrasting land cover changes. We used mist nets to obtain samples of understory bird food contents to identify the plant species consumed and dispersed by them. We estimated network complexity on the basis of the number of interactions, links per species, interaction evenness, and modularity. Our findings showed that the number of interactions increased with the amount of forest cover, and it was significantly lower in the more deforested region. None of the other evaluated parameters were affected by any other landscape or local predictors. We also observed a lack of significant network structure compared to null models, which we attribute to a pervasive impoverishment of bird and plant communities in these highly modified landscapes. Our results demonstrate the importance of forest cover not only to maintain species diversity but also their respective mutualistic relationships, which are the bases for ecosystem functionality, forest regeneration and the provision of ecological services.

TI  - Species diversity in restoration plantings: Important factors for increasing the diversity of threatened tree species in the restoration of the Araucaria forest ecosystem
T2  - PLANT DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Araucaria forest ecosystem in southern Brazil is highly threatened: less than one percent of the original forest remains, and what is left is a fragmented agro-mosaic of mostly early-to-late secondary forest patches among high-yield agriculture and timber monocultures. Forest restoration initiatives in this region aim to restore degraded areas, however the limited number of species used in restoration projects represents a missed opportunity for species-rich plantings. High diversity plantings represent a larger number of functional groups and provide a targeted conservation strategy for the high number of threatened species within this ecosystem. This study interviewed nurseries (Ns) and restoration practitioners (RPs) in Parana and Santa Catarina states to identify what species are being cultivated and planted, and what factors are driving the species selection process. An average of 20 species were reportedly used in restoration plantings, most of which are common, widespread species. Baseline data confirms that Ns and RPs have disproportionately low occurrences of threatened species in their inventories and plantings, supporting findings from previous research. Questionnaire responses reveal that opportunities for seed acquisition are an extremely important factor in order for nurseries to increase their diversity of cultivated species. Results also suggest that facilitating species-rich plantings for restoration practitioners would only be feasible if it did not increase the time required to complete planting projects, as it would minimize their ability to keep costs low. This study proposes solutions for increasing the number of species used in restoration practice-such as developing a comprehensive species list, fostering knowledge-sharing between actors, creating seed sharing programs, and increasing coordination of planting projects. Long-term strategies involve complimenting traditional ex situ approaches with emerging inter-situ and quasi in situ conservation strategies which simultaneously provide long-term preservation of genetic diversity and increase seed production of target species.

TI  - Monitoring of Floristic Composition and Species Diversity an Initial Step Towards the Restoration of Mangrove Forest in Teluk Adang Nature Reserve, Indonesia
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove is known as a unique and complex ecosystem, located in the intertidal zone vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. In this study, we analyzed the floristic composition and relationship between species density and soil properties of mangrove forests in Teluk Adang Nature Reserve (TANR), East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Data were collected by establishing 6 transects placed perpendicular to the sea. The results showed that there were 14 species of mangroves in TANR. The current remaining stand has not been disturbed by human intervention. Rhizophora apiculata dominated all growth strata (seedlings, saplings, and trees) with the Important Value Index (IVI) of 98.22%; 127.73%, 144.03%, respectively. Ecologically, the density and distribution of Rhizophora apiculata correlated with soil texture conditions such as silt and clay. The tree density of mangroves in TANR was classified as low with an average of 606.67 +/- 147.230 ind ha(-1). The average values of diameter, height, and basal area were 18.16 +/- 2.119 cm; 12.24 +/- 2.667 m; 42.56 +/- 2.255 m ha(-1), respectively. The Margalef species richness index and Shannon Wienner diversity index in TANR were in the low-to-moderate category. To improve the condition of the disturbed mangrove forests, it should be immediately restored by considering the result of the analysis of the current composition and structure of mangrove vegetation.

TI  - The influence of herbaceous vegetation on the colonization of native and invasive trees: consequences for semiarid forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the influence of herbaceous vegetation on the colonization of an invasive and two native tree species in a degraded area located at the Caatinga semiarid forest in Northeastern Brazil. Seedlings of the native trees Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva were planted in nine paired blocks with intact and removed herbaceous vegetation. In addition, seeds of the invasive tree species Leucaena leucocephala were sown in the same paired plots. Growth, germination, establishment, and survival of the tree species were monitored for 8 months. The results showed that herbaceous vegetation hampered native seedling growth in respect to leaf number, leaf size, height, and stem diameter. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation had a neutral effect on the germination, establishment, and growth of the invasive species L. leucocephala. Dominant ruderal herbaceous species strongly prevent the natural succession of native trees in this semiarid forest, while not affecting the establishment of an invasive tree. Management of herbaceous vegetation cover in degraded areas might be a key step for successful restoration in this dryland.

TI  - Attraction of the fruit-eating bat Carollia perspicillata to Piper gaudichaudianum essential oil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed field tests using mimetic Piper fruits with and without essential oil extracted through hydrodistillation from Piper gaudichaudianum ripe fruits in order to evaluate the role of odor in Carollia perspicillata attraction and capture in mist-nets. During the field tests, 26 C. perspicillata were captured, 21 (80.7%) in nets with the essential oil of P. gaudichaudianum and five (19.3%) in nets without oil. Other bat species, Artibeus spp. ( 67), which is specialized on fruits of Moraceae, and Sturnira lilium ( 10), specialized on those of Solanaceae, were also captured, but they exhibited no significant preference for nets with or without oil. We conclude that odor is pre-eminent over visual cues in food location by C. perspicillata in a field situation. Based on the result, we propose the extraction and use of essential oils of chiropterochoric fruits as a useful approach to improve autoecological studies on fruit-eating bats and to promote tropical forest restoration through the attraction of frugivorous bats to degraded areas.

TI  - Initial development and biomass partitioning of Physocalymma scaberrimum Pohl (Lythraceae) under different shading levels
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado Biome lost wide areas of native vegetation over the last decades. This fact reveals a high demand for studies that assess the potential of native species for reforestation purposes. Given this gap, this study aimed to evaluate the initial development of seedlings of Physocalymma scaberrimum under different shading levels, because of the potential of the species for reforestation and forest restoration. This research was conducted in a nursery at 0 % (full sun), 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% shading. Parameters were evaluated for germination, biomass and root, number of leaves, stern diameter, height and Dickson quality index of seedlings (DQI) at 150, 180, 210, 240 and 270 days after seedling emergence. The results between treatments were compared by ANOVA and regression analysis. The higher values of stem diameter, number of leaves, root and total biomass and DQI were found in the intermediate levels of shading. For large scale production of seedlings of P. scaberrimum with optimum quality we recommend the intermediate levels of shading, preferably 50 %.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in lands degraded by gold mining in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southeastern Peruvian Amazon, small-scale and artisanal gold mining has become a common activity and represents one of the greatest threats to forests. The study evaluated the natural regeneration of vegetation and the physicochemical properties of the soil for a chronosequence in Madre de Dios (Peru). Fourteen plots of 250 m2 were installed, distributed across areas with abandonment times varying from 2 to 19 years. All stems with a diameter at breast height >= 1 cm in each plot were recorded and classified according to size categories (saplings, poles, and trees). We recorded 1023 individuals distributed in 80 species and 27 families. The most abundant families were Fabaceae, Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae. Inga thibaudiana, Ochroma pyramidale, and Cecropia membranacea were present in all three size categories. The plots exhibited high heterogeneity, with medium diversity and very low species dominance. The dominant dispersal syndrome was zoochory (>60%). Pioneer species dominated initial and secondary succession with a higher abundance and species richness, decreasing considerably in late secondary succession. The soils exhibited a sandy loam texture, moderate to strongly acidic pH, poor nutrients, and limited organic matter. Soil alterations due to mining will therefore lead to slow natural regeneration.

TI  - Revisiting the concept of "fiscal modules": implications for restoration and conservation programs in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fiscal modules (FMs) were created to facilitate the collection of the rural territorial tax in Brazil. In theory, the area of a FM should be enough for a family to have income, survive, and thrive. The current Native Vegetation Protection Law (Law 12.651/2012) gives equal treatment to all people who own up to four FMs through the Environmental Regularization Program for small properties and family agriculture. Thus, FMs are parameters for flexible land allocation, reducing the area in which the restoration of native vegetation is mandatory. In this study, we sought to describe the history of the creation of FMs to verify the correlations between current agricultural and socioeconomic indicators and FM size. We used a case study in the state of Rio de Janeiro in southeast Brazil to analyze how updating the FM affects the Environmental Regularization Program proposed by the Native Vegetation Protection Law. FMs were created in 1979 and set in 1980, but have never been updated. Current data on land use, rate of deforestation, and productivity in rural areas should lead to changes in the FM size and value. Analyzing the data from municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, we found that the groups formed in the cluster analysis differed from the existing FM groups in the state, which range from 5 to 35 ha. This difference may be a consequence of the failure to update the FM parameters, because updating the FM definition may result in less hectares in each FM. This would result in a larger area to be restored, according to the Environmental Regularization Program, and would thus favor the overall goals of forest restoration.

TI  - Past land-use and ecological resilience in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest: implications for passive restoration
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire-15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned-36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum-Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.

TI  - PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES IN JUVENILE AND MATURE WOOD OF SHIZOLOBIUM PARAHYBA CAUSED BY THERMAL MODIFICATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, the pioneer species Schizolobium parahyba, known as guapuruvu, is a fast-growing tree with potential for ecological restoration in forest management projects. However, an undesirable feature of this wood is the pronounced presence of juvenile wood leading to poor dimensional stability. This study evaluates the effect of various thermal modification intensities on the physicochemical properties of S. parahyba juvenile and mature wood. Boards sawn from 15-year-old trees were thermally modified at three different temperatures (180, 200 and 220 degrees C). Thermal modification decreased the density (up to 9%), moisture content (up to 9.1%) and volumetric swelling (up to 54.1%). For chemical properties, when the wood was submitted to thermal modification at 220 degrees C, significant increase was detected in the respective extractive (up to 286.5%) and lignin content (up to 41.7%), and reduction in the holoceluloses (up to 25.0%). It was demonstrated that basic density was not the most suitable parameter for evaluating the quality of thermally modified wood. The influence of thermal modification was equal in juvenile and mature wood.

TI  - Richness and composition of Calliphoridae in an Atlantic Forest fragment: implication for the use of dipteran species as bioindicators
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies measuring the damage in degraded environments have increased, and it is necessary to obtain reliable biological and ecological indicators for the recovery of such degraded environments and subsequent preservation. This study aimed to conduct a survey of local insects and evaluate their utility in monitoring forest restoration in a degraded area in the Atlantic Forest biome in Ribeirao Grande, State of So Paulo, Brazil. Collections with Shuey traps were conducted from 2006 to 2011 in four distinct forest fragments characterized by environmental impacts, human actions, and phytophysiognomic profiles: Forest (FO), a preserved area with native plant species; "Capoeira" (CA), an area in the natural regeneration process; Planting (PL), an area reforested with native plants; and Pasture (PA), an area with only shrubs. A total of 2,456 specimens of Calliphoridae (Diptera) were collected. Mesembrinella bellardiana was the most abundant (n = 1,884) and dominant species in all environments sampled. The relative abundance of M. bellardiana in the most preserved environment (60.2 % FO, 24.4 % CA, 8.6 % PL, and 6.7 % PA) and other ecological parameters showed that it could be a bioindicator species, i.e., data on its presence or absence directly reflected the status of local preservation. Information on Neotropical dipterans associated with the forested environment is very scarce in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the occurrence of Calliphora lopesi (Calliphoridae) in the State of So Paulo.

TI  - Evaluation of Forest Restoration in a Degraded Permanent Preservation Area in Santa Catarina State, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the process of restoration in a degraded Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) in the municipality of Pouso Redondo, Santa Catarina state, six years after the initial plantation of trees and isolation of the area. Tree species were surveyed and increment of richness by natural establishment was quantified. Syndromes of propagule dispersion and regeneration guilds were determined. A total of 918 individuals from 73 species were found; 48 (65.8%) of them were species naturally established in the area. 71.2% of the species were classified as zoochoric (71.2%), and 54.8% as light demanding for climax. After six years, the restoration process was characterized by a trend of richness increment and replacement of initial by late successional species, indicating the relevance of the natural regeneration mechanism.

TI  - LEAF AREA REDUCTION AND TRANSPLANT TIMING FOR THE USE OF SEEDLINGS FROM UNDERSTOREY IN FOREST RESTORATION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of seedlings from natural regeneration has been recommended as an strategy for seedlings production aiming at forest restoration but many of its technical aspects still need to be scientifically investigated. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of leaf area reduction and immediate transplant on the survival and growth of seedlings of native tree species obtained from a naturally regenerating forest. Esenbeckia leiocarpa (Rutaceae), Eugenia ligustrina (Myrtaceae) and Maytenus salicifolia (Celastraceae) seedlings, obtained from a secondary remnant of semideciduous seasonal forest in Bofete-SP, Brazil, were extracted from the ground and submitted to one of the following treatments: I) 50% area reduction of each leaf and immediate transplant; II) no leaf area reduction and immediate transplant; III) 50% area reduction of each leaf, maintenance of the seedling in water and transplant 24h after harvest; IV) no leaf area reduction, maintenance of the seedling in water and transplant 24h after seedlings harvest. The seedlings were evaluated according to their survivorship and height over a eight month period. Results evidenced that neither leaf area reduction nor maintenance of seedling in container with water for 24 hours before transplant affected the evaluated parameters. Thus, leaf area reduction and immediate transplant to pots are unnecessary procedures for use in forest nurseries when seedlings are obtained from naturally regenerating forests.

TI  - Ecological restoration of exposed subsoil conditioned with residues in the Cerrado
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration projects aim to restore native vegetation, and monitoring is an essential step in evaluating the applied technique. The construction of the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Parana River, between the states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil), in the 1960s, left behind extensive degraded areas, known as "borrowed areas" and characterized by the removal of the vegetation and superficial soil horizons. The experimental field is located on the Farm of UNESP / Ilha Solteira Campus, in the municipality of Selviria-MS. Residues were incorporated into the subsoil as conditioners. The residues, aquatic macrophytes (0, 16, and 32 t ha(-1)) and sugarcane bagasse ash (0, 15, 30 and 45 t ha(-1)), were combined in 12 treatments and 1080 seedlings (10 different Cerrado tree species) were planted in the study area. The objective of this work was to evaluate the induction of revegetation, established 5 years previously, through the ecological indicators: Soil cover with native vegetation (CSVN); density of native regenerating individuals (DINR) and number of native regenerating species (NENR). Based on the indicators, the results show that the addition of residues and planting of the seedlings were efficient for the ecological recovery of the studied area, with the highest doses of macrophyte yielding the best recovery rates.

TI  - Waterline distance effects in the recovery of forest structure and soil organic matter 12 years after restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to restore tropical forests can result in large unpredictability in their trajectories, mainly due to spatial variation in abiotic conditions and plant resource availability. With the construction of a small hydroelectric power plant, a 70-ha forest restoration was conducted in 2008 within the boundaries of seasonal semideciduous forest in southeastern Brazil. This study described the spatial variation of the restored ecosystem after 12 years by simultaneously evaluating the direct influences of distance from the water body (waterline distance) and soil moisture, and the indirect influence of these factors mediated by the forest structure on accumulated litter and soil organic matter (SOM). These effects were estimated in the area under restoration and in forest remnants (considered as reference sites) (Model A), or in the area under restoration alone (Model B). Data on forest structure included density of individuals, total basal area, tree average diameter, average trunk volume index and stratification. Tree density decreased with increasing waterline distance both in the restoration area and in the forest remnants. Consequently, the sites closest to the reservoir formed denser and more stratified forests. Waterline distance and soil moisture content were correlated with each other, but each variable had independent effects of on the amount of litter and SOM. Wetter sites with denser and more stratified forest had greater amounts of accumulated litter and soil organic matter, but only in Model A, which included both the restored area and the forest remnants. In addition, higher basal area values contributed weakly to greater amounts of accumulated litter. Thus, our study suggests that the trajectory and speed of recovery of some ecosystem processes were determined by the waterline distance and soil moisture. Furthermore, the restoration implementation in the period of just 12 years was sufficient to detect the effect of these actions on the litter accumulation and a substantial increase in the amount of soil organic matter.

TI  - Effects of secondary forest succession on the richness and composition of frog species in humid tropical forest
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate whether the richness and composition of anurans responded to the time of forest regeneration via secondary succession. We sampled the anuran community in a mosaic of areas at three different stages of secondary succession in the Atlantic Forest, southern Brazil. The anurans were collected from nine lentic ponds and from their margins up to a 50 m radius. The late secondary forest sheltered the higher species richness, followed by the primary forest. The spatial variation in species richness was related to the forest succession stage and predominance of arboreal vegetation on the pond edge. The species composition changed throughout the succession stages, regardless of the distance among areas. Along the gradient of forest succession, environmental changes have driven species distribution, limiting the occurrence of forest species and favoring the colonization of areas at the early succession stage by opportunist species. We could observe that the secondary forest succession was a determining factor in the anuran community structure, and with the advancement of the secondary succession, both richness and composition were partly restored. Thus, the conservation of secondary forests might be an efficient strategy to preserve the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Forest restoration by different nucleation techniques in Urochloa grassland
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of brushwood, black plastic mulch, herbicide, and artificial perch on the natural regeneration of native species in Urochloa grassland. The experiment was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016 in the Dense Ombrophilous Forest, in the municipality of Morretes, in the state of Parana, Brazil. The treatments were: herbicide, herbicide + perch, black plastic mulch, black plastic mulch + perch, brushwood + herbicide. brushwood + herbicide + perch, and a control treatment. The evaluations were carried out at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after the installation of the experiment, by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and estimating visually the percentage of herbaceous coverage. Initially, brushwood and black plastic mulch reduced the Urochloa grasses; however, this effect was lost over time due to the rapid growth of the grasses from the edges to the center of the plots. The use of perches in the treatments does not allow a significant increase of other species because of the continued inhibiting conditions for the establishment of seedlings. The herbicide is effective in removing the grasses; however, the recruitment of woody species is only satisfactory when perches are used to attract the dispersing fauna. For a successful ecological restoration of pastures, there is a need for the local elimination of Urochloa grasses.

Wetlands are a productive ecosystem and have high biodiversity, including plankton. Plankton can be used to assess the health status of wetlands. This research aims to determine the diversity and abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton and to analyze the water quality conditions of the tropical wetland (Rowo Klampok Swamp, Malang District, East Java, Indonesia). This research was conducted from May to June 2023 and it's a survey research. The research results show that the phytoplankton found in Rowo Klampok Swamp consists of 4 divisions with 13 genera, while there are 3 divisions with 3 genera in zooplankton. Phytoplankton divisions are Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and Dinoflagellate, while zooplankton divisions are Arthropoda, Ciliophora, and Rotifera. The average value of total phytoplankton abundance reached 2,618,684 cells/L, while zooplankton was 10,504 Ind/L. The Chlorophyta division is the most commonly found phytoplankton, with a percentage ranging between 32.5 and 53.1%, respectively. Dictyosphaerium is a phytoplankton genus often found with the highest average abundance of 1,922,929 cells/L. The diversity index, uniformity index, and dominance index of phytoplankton ranged between 1.965-2.439, 0.945-1.173, and 0.125-0.213, respectively, while those of zooplankton were 0.496-0.529, 0.317-0.593 and 0.458-0.684, respectively. Rowo Klampok Swamp has a medium trophic level (mesotrophic) and shows moderate pollution. The water quality conditions are considered suitable for aquatic organisms, but we need to monitor and reduce phosphorus input into the bodies of water.

TI  - Direct seeding of forest species for ecological restoration in the Pampa - Atlantic Forest transition
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecotonal transition regions are neglected in floristic and ecological restoration studies, despite their vast occurrence and socioeconomic relevance. The present study evaluated the emergence and initial development of forest species from the ecotonal transition between the Pampas and the Atlantic Forest, in direct seeding, using inter-row green manure (Canavalia ensiformis). We tested sixteen species and evaluated emergence, survival and seedling height rates monthly for twelve months. Six species emerged and established themselves, with mean emergence values of 7%, survival rate of 73% and height of 20 cm. Larger seed species had higher emergence rates. All legumes in the study emerged (Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Parapiptadenia rigida, Bauhinia forficata and Mimosa bimucronata). The pitangueira (Eugenia uniflora) was the only recalcitrant seed species to present emergence. The coverage of jack bean provided greater establishment for Annona sylvatica and Enterolobium contortisiliquum, with statistical significance by the Wilcoxon test. For future studies on direct seeding, we recommend further study on the quality and size of forest seeds, responses in temperate climates, ideal sowing time, density and depth. For the green cover we recommend a higher sowing density and intercropping with other species, including native herbs and shrubs.

In 30 hours of focal observations on a specimen, using binoculars 10x25mm, between December 2008 and January 2009, 18 bird species consumed 169 fruits at 224 visits in an average of 5.6 +/- 3.6 feeding bouts/hour and 7.5 +/- 5.2 consumed fruits/hour.The potential for seed dispersal was relatively high, because 57.1% of fruits/arylated seeds were swallowed whole, especially by birds from the families Tyrannidae and Turdidae. Trichilia claussenii has demonstrated great potential for use in restoration projects of degraded areas focusing on plant-animal interactions, as its fruit has several characteristics that make them attractive to birds, being consumed by a large number of bird species and their seeds are apparently easily dispersed.

TI  - Can mulch be effective in controlling exotic grasses and promoting natural regeneration in ecological restoration?
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Mulching use in agriculture has been known since 1802 as the practice of spreading dry leaves and straw on the soil to prevent erosion and water loss. Our study evaluated the mulch effectiveness in the establishment of regenerating seedlings and its contribution to the control of exotic grasses. The studies were carried out in an ecological restoration area in the municipality of Itapira-SP. The treatment with mulching consisted in chemical desiccation with glyphosate herbicide application, keeping the dry grass on the ground. In the control treatment, after chemical weeding, the grass was removed with manual mowing, exposing the soil. Eight months after implantation, we sampled all regenerating seedlings in 100 plots of 50 x 50 cm in each treatment. We considered as seedlings all individuals of tree species less than 100 cm tall. We calculated richness, abundance, similarity, and the relationship of the frequency of seedlings to the height of the mulch. We sampled eight species with 42 seedlings, with only one not identified. The highest abundance and species richness were found in the treatment with mulch (n = 34 individuals; eight species), the most abundant being Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (14 individuals) followed by Solanum mauritianum Scop. (11 individuals), and Platypodium elegans Vog. (three individuals). The presence of exotic grasses was lower in the plots of the mulching (13%) compared to the control treatment (67%). The highest frequency of seedlings was obtained with mulch height from 21 to 37 cm. We suggest that adaptive management practices, such as the use of the mulching technique, can be implemented in ecological restoration areas, because they favor the natural regeneration of native seedlings and can contribute to the control of exotic grasses, but the height of the layer must be controlled.

TI  - Are Tree Seed Systems for Forest Landscape Restoration Fit for Purpose? An Analysis of Four Asian Countries
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality, suitably adapted tree seed at volume is a key component for the implementation and long-term success of forest landscape restoration (FLR). We analysed the tree seed systems in four Asian countries-the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and India-which have committed to restore in total over 47.5 million hectares of degraded lands by 2030. We assessed the national seed systems using an established indicator framework, literature review and expert surveys and interviews. Additionally, we surveyed 61 FLR practitioners about their challenges in acquiring seed to understand how the strengths and weaknesses identified at the national level were reflected in FLR projects on the ground. Identified key constraints common to the studied countries are (i) a mismatch between the growing demand for priority native species and the limited seed supply in terms of quantity and quality, (ii) lack of effective quality control for seed of native species and (iii) lack of information about the effects of climate change on native species to guide species selection and seed sourcing and to improve the resilience of restored ecosystems. We discuss options to strengthen seed systems for native tree species both in terms of quality and volume to enable them to effectively respond to the national FLR commitments and make recommendations on promising technical solutions.

TI  - MOWING AND HERBICIDE APPLICATION TO CONTROL Megathyrsus maximus: DAMAGE ON PRE-EXISTING VEGETATION IN A 20-YEAR REFORESTATION SITE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to control exotic grasses in areas of ecological restoration for long periods is followed by high economical costs of application, collateral damage on regeneration and other less obvious environmental harms. Thus, it is necessary estimate such drawbacks in order to evaluate the cost/benefit rate of the application of these techniques. This study aimed to assess the damage caused by two control techniques of Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K Simon & S. W. L. Jacobs), on pre-existing regeneration (environmental costs) in a 20-year reforestation site and estimate the economic costs of employing such techniques. Thirty 10 x 20m plots were divided into three groups: (CON) control, (ROC) mowing (using gas-powered brush cutters) and (HERB) mowing followed by the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide. We did a permanent inventory of all tree and shrub individuals, who were followed over a period of one year. No differences were found in mortality imposed by the initial mowing, neither in the mortality imposed exclusively by mowing nor in the mortality imposed exclusively by herbicide in HERB. After one year, there were no differences between mortality and species richness of the three groups. However, when the three groups were compared with themselves after one year, for plants > 1 m, we found a reduction on abundance in CON and reduction in species richness in HERB; whereas for plants < 1 m, ROC showed a reduction in abundance and HERB showed reduced abundance and species richness. Therefore, both techniques seem to affect more plants < 1 m (i. e., regeneration). The final economic cost of ROC was 34.1% bigger than the cost of HERB, and in spite of a likely reduction in costs to perform new interventions, proportional costs increased for scattered interventions over small areas. Both techniques were efficient to control Guinea-grass, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicide should be restricted to areas with low canopy cover, more maintenance-demanding sites, once the technique is more damaging on regeneration, since there was high mortality (73%) of individuals < 1 m in areas with dense grass infestation (100%).

TI  - Identification of Priority Areas for Forest Restoration Using Self-Organizing Maps Neural Network
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to identifying priority areas for forest restoration and analyze variables related to such areas at two distinct spatial scales using Self-Organizing Maps neural network (SOM). Initially, a SOM analysis was conducted to detect a watershed suitable for forest restoration within the Management Unit for Hydrological Resources of the Paraiba do Sul river, located in Sao Paulo State, southeast of Brazil. The variables employed in this analysis were environmental connectivity and forest cover. The Jaguari watershed, located in the municipality of Igarata, was selected as study area in the second stage of analysis. In the permanent preservation areas along riversides within this watershed, a new SOM analysis was performed to detect suitable areas for forest restoration. At this more refined scale, the regarded variables were distance to forest fragments, urban areas, paved roads, and rural constructions, as well as the NDVI (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and the natural soil erosion potential. At both scales, the priority areas for forest restoration were assessed based on cluster histograms of SOM. Finally, a contributive map of samples for the best matching units was elaborated, and that enabled an insightful approach for the analysis of the generated clusters.

TI  - Forest restoration after severe degradation by coal mining: lessons from the first years of monitoring
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration after mining often requires strong interventions, including soil reconstruction, which makes vegetation establishment a challenge. We analyzed regeneration of woody plant species in the first years of restoration in areas severely degraded by coal mining in the south Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. At the four restoration sites, we collected data on cover of the herbaceous layer (including invasive grasses) and on abundance and richness of introduced trees and of spontaneously establishing woody plants. We also evaluated soil chemical features at all sites. We compared functional characteristics of the woody regeneration with nearby forest remnants (target communities) and evaluated the dynamics of regeneration over 3 years by principal coordinates analyses. The influence of biotic and abiotic variables for the regeneration of woody species was analyzed by partial redundancy analysis. We found high variation in community composition and structure among restored sites. Most of this variation was explained by variables related to soil chemistry and introduced trees. Over time, an increase in woody species establishment could be observed, and woody species communities appear to be at the start of trajectories toward target communities. Fertilization of soil, as commonly applied in restoration, seems to increase cover of exotic grasses, which clearly impedes the development of planted trees and woody species regeneration. Although the restoration of abandoned mining areas is a challenge due to the severe degradation, our results-despite the short period of observation-allow for the conclusion that restoration is possible, even with high initial costs. We highlight the importance of monitoring the initial process of restoration and of (re) defining intermediate goal and project targets, following an adaptive management approach.

AB  - Harmonis, Rahim A, Hidayat HA, Saud OR, Wilujeng M, Sampe R, Kartika KF, Aminudin, Butar TB. 2022. Diversity of butterflies in the tropical wetland of Kayan-Sembakung Delta, North Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 3303-3312. Butterflies, which belong to the order Lepidoptera, are considered superior biological indicators to evaluate environmental conditions in various types of habitats due to their high richness in biodiversity, short generation time, good movement, and high sensitivity. Since butterflies produce various benefits for the ecosystem, their conservation currently receives significant attention in order to improve human wellbeing. However, there is still limited research about butterfly diversity in tropical wetlands, especially in Borneo (Kalimantan) Island. Herein, we identify the diversity of butterflies found in the Kayan-Sembakung Delta, North Kalimantan, which is still unexplored so far. The area was dominated by mangroves, peat swamps, and brackish swamps. The research locations inside the Kayan-Sembakung Delta were divided into 20 groups. The specimen was collected by an aerial insect net and bait traps. The diversity index, taxonomy structure, and domination index were further investigated. The results showed that the highest individuals (69) and species (36) had been found in Pembeliangan. Altogether, we found 608 individuals of 92 species in the areas studied. Among others, the family of Nymphalidae was noted as the most dominant. We stated that the diversity of butterflies was also influenced by the type of habitat, as it could be found at the peat swamp forest where the highest species were found. In the meantime, some unique species have been found in the KayanSembakung Delta, including Arhopala overdijkinki, Hypolycaena thecloides, Drupadia johorensis, Idea leuconoe, and Polyura jalysus. The results of this study are expected to give more information for future management and conservation of the wetland areas, especially in the Kayan-Sembakung Delta.

TI  - Geostatistical modeling applied to spatiotemporal dynamics of successional tree species groups in a natural Mixed Tropical Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A lack of ecological knowledge leads to innovative tools for investigating spatial relationships in natural forests, among which geostatistics stands out as a set of statistical techniques for modeling and mapping. Thus, this paper aims to apply geostatistical analysis to map and correlate the spatial patterns and dynamics of the basal area for successional tree species groups in a Mixed Tropical Forest remnant in the southern part of Brazil. The floristic composition was obtained through continuous inventory conducted in 400 plots, where the basal area was evaluated for total stock and ecological groups: pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax. Subsequently, geostatistical analysis was used for modeling the spatial patterns of the basal area, and ordinary kriging interpolation was applied to compose thematic maps. The results show that the forest structure presents spatial dependence and heterogeneous distribution, in which the spatial behavior of successional tree groups is associated with species aggregation patterns. Moreover, spatial dynamics are influenced by basal area increment, in which spatial changes indicate a natural forest in an advanced secondary successional stage, reflecting a favorable conservation status. This shows the importance of Conservation Units policies as preservation strategies and biodiversity sources for forest restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A review of the freshwater diversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana): taxonomic composition, ecology, comparison with similar systems and conservation status.
T2  - Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater organisms in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana) provide direct and indirect benefits to people and the economy of the region. However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region.

TI  - Tropical wetlands for climate change research, water quality management and conservation education on a university campus in Costa Rica
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - EARTH University is a small agronomic university with a theme of sustainability in eastern Costa Rica. Several natural and constructed wetlands on its campus are used for research, water quality improvement, and higher education. It has become an important location for research and teaching on humid tropical wetland ecology and management. A 112-ha flow-through Raphia taedigera (Arecaceae) forested wetland is being used for climate change research, focusing on carbon sequestration and methane generation. Methane emissions are measured seasonally and are comparable to rates in tropical wetlands published elsewhere. Carbon sequestration by the wetland appears to be substantially higher than similar flow-through temperate zone wetlands. Treatment wetlands are used on campus to improve water quality of effluents from an animal farm, a dairy plant, a landfill, and a banana paper plant. Water quality was substantially improved in all of these wetlands except the landfill leachate wetland. All of these campus wetlands have been integrated into the four-year education program of EARTH University and 22 undergraduate projects have been completed on wetlands over the past 14 years.

TI  - The restoration of tropical seed dispersal networks
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have led to the loss of habitats and biodiversity in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Brazil. Ecological restoration aims to rebuild this biome and should include not only the reinstatement of species but also the reestablishment of complex ecological interactions and the ecological functions that they provide. One such function is seed dispersal, which is provided by the interactions between animal frugivores and plants. We studied seed dispersal networks in 3 different tropical forest sites restored 15, 25, and 57 years ago; temporal scales rarely observed in restoration studies. We investigated changes in network structure (nestedness, modularity, and network specialization) in these communities over restoration time. Although network size and the number of interactions increased with time since restoration, the networks were composed of generalist birds, and the large frugivores remained absent. Contrary to our expectations though, species richness was highest in the 25-year-old site, maybe due to the higher number of species used in the planting. Nestedness values were low in all 3 networks, but the highest nestedness was observed in the intermediate-aged site. However, the oldest network was significantly modular and showed higher complementary specialization. These results suggest that 57 years after restoration, the complexity of mutualistic interactions in seed dispersal networks has increased, this enhancing ecosystem function in the Atlantic forest.

TI  - Diversity and Benefits of Arbuscular Mycorrhizae in Restored Riparian Plantations
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing use of vegetation for fuel wood, cattle, agriculture, and due to population pressure that negatively affects biodiversity values, more plantations are needed to obtain a permanent vegetal cover. Attention has been paid to microbial interactions (arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM)) for management and inoculation. To evaluate the benefits of inoculation, the root colonization of inoculated seedlings, soil aggregation, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity were examined by two field treatments (fertilized with organic matter (OM) vs. fertilized with natural rock phosphate (P)). The preserved and experimental areas presented higher AMF spore number and richness (nine species) than the degraded areas. The addition of OM or P did not improve root colonization by AMF; however, it was a guarantee for a successful restoration as, in the restored fields, a high soil aggregation was found, in addition to a high root colonization, spore number, and richness of AMF. However, the undisturbed site presented the more prominent values. This study showed that AMF are important components in riparian areas, and it brings information for inoculant production in ecological restoration using mixed plantations, contributing to the establishment of mycorrhizal vegetation and soil aggregation that not only benefit AM plants, but also allow non-host plants in degraded areas.

TI  - Organic carbon stocks across various land use systems in Sandy Ultisols and Oxisols in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major carbon pool that can be easily affected by land use change, especially in tropical humid sandy soils, where organic decomposition is fast and SOC stabilization is weak. Here, we assessed SOC stocks in coarse-textured Oxisols and Ultisols under six contrasting land uses in western Sao Paulo, Brazil, an area marked by warm temperatures, within the Atlantic Rainforest biome. Soils were sampled for bulk density and SOC content to a 1-m depth in areas under a) primary native forest, b) native forest restoration, c) pastures, d) sugarcane, e) cassava, and f) annual crops. Even under primary forests, SOC stocks were low relatively to other Brazilian soils under cooler climates and with finer textures, and the effect of land use changes varied with soil type. In both soil types, the lowest SOC stocks occurred under cassava cultivation, a traditional indigenous crop with low soil coverage and which requires intensive soil disturbance for harvesting. In Ultisols, forest restoration and sugarcane presented the highest SOC stocks, whereas in Oxisols, the highest stocks occurred under primary forests and pastures, suggesting that gramineous perennial crops with little soil disturbance are effective in preserving or even sequestering SOC in these areas. When only primary forests are compared, SOC stocks in Oxisols were higher than in Ultisols, probably due the effect of higher soil bulk densities on the Ultisols, rendering root development and thus SOC accrual in subsoil more difficult.

TI  - Richness of Cerrado Woody Species Engaged in Ecological Restoration in the Brazilian Federal District
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has evaluated the richness of Cerrado woody species engaged in ecological restoration in the Brazilian Federal District (BFD). A survey gathered information on plant species traded by local nurseries, species recommended in restoration plans (PRADs), species effectively introduced in areas under restoration, and species present in preserved fragments of Cerrado. Results summed 566 Cerrado woody species from 80 botanical families of which 171 species were traded by local nurseries, 277 were recommended in PRADs, 190 were effectively used in restoration projects, and 434 species were sampled in fragments of native Cerrado. We found low similarity between species composition available in nurseries, recommended in PRADs, used in restoration projects and present in preserved fragments of native Cerrado. Such results indicate a poor connection between steps related to the selection of native woody species that make up initial plant communities on sites under ecological restoration.

TI  - INTERCROPPING NATIVE TREE SPECIES OF SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST WITH CASSAVA (Manihot sculenta Crantz) FOR RESTORATION OF RIPARIAN FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercropping of trees and annual crops could be an important alternative for promoting forest restoration in small farms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the intercropping of cassava (Manihot sculenta Crantz) with native trees for restoration of natural forest in riparian areas in the western Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replications for comparing two restoration systems: pure afforestation and afforestation intercropped with cassava. It was evaluated the variables related to seedling development (height, crown diameter, crown cover, and height/crown diameter ratio), mortality and the economic impact were assessed for using cassava. No differences were found between treatments for any dendrometrical variable and mortality. Economic impact of the intercroppoing treatment was positive because costs for establishment of intercropped system were partially reduced by the income from the cassava crop, which covered 32% of total costs. Cassava income made final costs 19% lesser than restoration in the pure afforestation system.

TI  - Secondary forests offset less than 10% of deforestation-mediated carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km(2)of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 +/- 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.

TI  - Direct seeding in the restoration of post-mined campo rupestre: Germination and establishment of 14 native species
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding in the restoration of degraded areas requires less financial investment and facilitates the use of greater diversity of species from different functional groups than traditional planting of seedlings. However, the application of this technique in the ecological restoration of post-mined areas in grassland environments is still poorly investigated. This study evaluated seed germination under controlled conditions, seedling establishment and associated costs of 14 species native to the Brazilian campos rupestres through direct seeding in a post-mined area. The effects of the incorporation of plant material (litter) to the degraded substrate on plant establishment were also measured. Under controlled conditions, 64% (9 out of 14) of the evaluated species showed germinability between 30 and 77%. Under field conditions, one year after, it was observed that the incorporation of plant litter to the substrate allowed the establishment of 49 individuals m(-2) of nine species, four of which with establishment percentage and cost per seedling of, respectively, 1.4-6.2% and US$ 0.006-0.09. In the other treatments, no significant plant establishment was observed. Despite the low percentage of establishment, direct seeding combined with the incorporation of plant litter to the substrate allowed the revegetation of a post-mined area with viable cost. The use of suitable species for direct seeding combined with techniques that promote improvements in substrate conditions is critical to increase establishment success using direct seeding in the ecological restoration of campos rupestres post-mined areas. Further studies on techniques to improve substrate quality and seed germination of native species of campos rupestres are required.

TI  - AVIFAUNA AS A BIOINDICATOR FOR THE EVALUATION OF FOREST RESTORATION: A CASE STUDY IN A 40-YEAR OLD RESTORED FOREST IN VICOSA, MINAS GERAIS STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The point-counts method was used to evaluate the bird community in a small patch of forest (1 ha) restored through reforestation, with more than 40 years of deployment, in Vicosa, MG state. In total, 20 points were sampled in the reproductive period of the birds, during 2011. A total of 31 bird species and 160 contacts were recorded, and all species were identified as typical from a semi-deciduous forest and included five endemic species of the Atlantic forest biome. In the present study, the presence of frugivorous and insectivorous birds in the understory with little tolerance for open environments and strong insolation, suggests the good quality of the sampled habitat, confirming that the restored forest is in an advanced stage of succession. The results of this study also demonstrate that even in a small area, and with a few days of sampling, it is possible to obtain a rapid characterization of the bird community, being possible to associate it to the habitat conditions and allowing a safe evaluation of the success of a forest restoration project.

TI  - Effects of bamboo dominance and palm-heart harvesting on the phylogenetic structure of the seed and seedling communities in an old-growth Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive assessment of the effect of disturbances on tropical and subtropical forests is needed to better understand their impacts on forest structure and diversity. Although taxonomic and functional diversity measures have been successfully adopted in this context, phylogenetic diversity metrics are still poorly explored. We compared the phylogenetic structure of the seed rain and regenerating seedling community in patches of an old-growth Atlantic Forest remnant dominated or not by a ruderal bamboo species, Guadua tagoara. We sampled those patches before and after illegal harvesting of the palm Euterpe edulis thus assessing if the harvesting led to changes in the phylogenetic structure of the seed rain and the regenerating community in both patches. Bamboo-dominated patches showed a significantly higher presence of species in the seed rain that were more distantly related to each other in the phylogeny than expected by chance compared with patches without bamboos, but this difference disappeared after palm-heart harvesting. Contrary to what we expected, we did not find significant changes in the phylogenetic structure of seedlings before or after palm-heart harvesting. The phylogenetic structure at the tips of the phylogeny was random overall. The maintenance of a higher presence of far relatives in the phylogeny of the seedling community suggests, assuming trait conservatism, that despite bamboo dominance and palm-heart harvesting, functional diversity is being preserved at least in the early regenerating stages and in the time frame of the study. However, higher presence of pioneer taxa after palm-heart harvest indicates that this disturbance may lead old-growth areas to earlier successional stages.

TI  - Seed germination variability and its association with functional traits in submontane tropical forest species of Indonesia: recommendations for direct seeding
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed germination is a crucial component of the reproductive cycle of plants, and thus, knowledge of germination strategies plays a vital role in species selection for seed-based forest restoration. Conducting germination testing for tropical species requires enormous resources. Therefore, a functional trait-based approach is needed to predict germination success based on seed traits. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on germination and the correlation between functional traits and germination for tropical native species. In this study, we assessed seed traits and conducted germination assays for 31 woody plant species from the submontane tropical forest of West Java, Indonesia. Our results indicated that seed functional traits and germination varied among the species examined. Germination clustered into five categories: early-high, early-medium, early-low, late-low, and failed. Specific seed traits can be used to predict both germination percentage and mean germination time. Variability in seed coat ratio and seed dormancy explains differences in germination percentages, while mean germination time is primarily influenced by seed mass and seed coat thickness. This study presents valuable germination data for ten woody tropical native species that germinate readily without the need for special treatments, including Acer laurinum, Aphanamixis polystachya, Engelhardia serrata, Ficus fistulosa, F. ribes, Gaultheria leucocarpa, Maoutia diversifolia, Ormosia penangensis, Phyllanthus emblica, and Saurauia pendula. Incorporating a trait-based approach in species selection strategies may reduce the number of seeds required for direct seeding and enhance the germination success of direct seeding efforts.

TI  - From dropping to dropping: The contribution of a small primate to seed dispersal in Atlantic Forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic interaction between animals and plants through frugivory and seed dispersal is one of several ecological processes that modulates tropical biodiversity. Here we evaluated the potential role of a highly-frugivorous Neotropical primate, the black-fronted titi monkey (Callicebus nigrifrons), as seed disperser. We studied two titi monkey groups in semideciduous Atlantic Forest remnants. Each group fed on over 49 zoochorous plant species in about one year and ingested seeds from nearly a half of them, especially those with small seeds (< 0.5 cm). The groups of titi monkeys defecated a large number of seeds, reaching over 300 seeds per day (1-305). More than half of the total deposited seeds and seed species germinated after gut passage, however gut passage reduced germination success in three of five evaluated species. Feces were deposited in small clumps distributed across groups' home range. We suggest that the observed distribution pattern of feces may enhance plant reproductive fitness by increasing the probability of seeds being deposited far from parent plants, in novel and favorable sites. We concluded that the seed handling and deposition behavior of black-fronted titi monkey make this primate an important agent for Atlantic forest regeneration.

TI  - Recovery of genetic diversity levels of a Neotropical tree in Atlantic Forest restoration plantations
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To support the long-term ecological viability of restoration projects, it is necessary to reach adequate levels of genetic diversity in spontaneously recolonizing and reintroduced populations. The importance of genetic diversity in the long-term viability of populations is acknowledged, but still poorly monitored in restoration projects. This study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity and inbreeding levels of populations of a tree species widely used in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Centrolobium tomentosurn, exploring the potential of active restoration in successfully reestablishing populations with higher chances of long-term perpetuation in agricultural landscapes. We used both nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers to assess genetic parameters in juveniles and adult individuals in two high-diversity restoration plantations (28 and 60 years old), one disturbed fragment, and one large and well conserved protected area. We observed similar levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding, for juveniles and adults, in both restored and natural populations. Surprisingly, haplotype diversity was higher in restoration sites. We also found private alleles in juveniles in both restoration areas, and this is evidence of gene flow between restored and neighboring natural populations. However, we observed negative effects of inbreeding on the effective population size of populations from the disturbed natural remnant and restoration areas. These results provide evidence of the capacity of restoration plantations for recovering high levels of genetic diversity and the importance of maintaining large and well conserved forest remnants to be used as seed sources for restoration efforts.

TI  - Can native species control the above-ground biomass and reproductive output of Urochloa decumbens, an invasive grass in the Brazilian savannas?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of exotic species is a global problem that impacts natural ecosystems. Here, we assessed the impact of the annual grass Andropogon fastigiatus and the shrub Lepidaploa aurea, two native species commonly used in restoration projects in the Brazilian savannas, on the control of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens. We did a plant competition experiment using 40 plots, where a single U. decumbens individual was surrounded by eight individuals of A. fastigiatus, L. aurea, or a combination of both species, along with a control treatment with only U. decumbens. After 4 months, we collected the aboveground biomass and seed biomass of focal U. decumbens individuals. Native species did not reduce the biomass or seed production of the U. decumbens. However, A. fastigiatus exhibited competitive ability similar to U. decumbens, being the only treatment where there was no increase in the invasive grass biomass. In the presence of L. aurea and when A. fastigiatus density was reduced by half, the biomass of U. decumbens was about three folds that observed in the control plots. This is likely due to a more effective use of available resources in the soil. Despite these two species being widely used in ecological restoration efforts in the Cerrado, we found that only A. fastigiatus was able to control U. decumbens biomass, but neither species could reduce the invasive grass reproductive output. Nevertheless, at high density, A. fastigiatus can be a strong competitor against U. decumbens and should be included in seed mixtures for Cerrado restoration.

TI  - PHYTOSOCIOLOGY OF A LOWER MONTANE FOREST ON MT. BATULANTEH, SUMBAWA, INDONESIA
T2  - Reinwardtia
M3  - Article
AB  - While Indonesia's forests are globally known for their high species diversity but many regions remain little known. The objective of the study was to investigate the tree community in a lower montane forest at Mt. Batulanteh in Sumbawa. We subjectively laid out plots of 1.800 m(2) each, two in secondary forests and one in a disturbed primary forest. All stems over 5 cm diameters were measured and identified. In the plot of 0.54 hectare, we recorded 723 individuals, representing 78 species, 60 genera and 33 families. Estimated volume of boles was 183.2 m(3)/0.54 ha. The forest at Mt. Batulanteh was classified as Garcinia-Cryptocarya association consisting of Micromelum-Cinnamomum subassociation. Dipterocarpus-Calophyllum sub association and Garcinia-Syzygium subassociation. Dominant species were Micromelum minutum (IV=27.24), Mallotus philippensis (IV=26.2), Oyptocarya ferrea (IV=24.71) and Cinnamomum burmanni (W=23.81) in Plot 1, Dipterocarpus retusus (IV=77.4) and Calophyllum soulattri (IV=24.21) in Plot 2, and Garcinia celebica (IV=34.86) and Syzygium sp. 1 (IV=34.76) in Plot 3. Dipterocarpus retusus was unique of having restricted distribution. Fagaceae, typical family in montane forests, was absent. Shannon's diversity index was low (H-1 = 1.61). It can be concluded that the plots do not constitute a representative of Mt. Batulanteh and the surrounding forests, but they were sufficient to provide an illustration of the forests locally. The diameter class distribution indicated that the forests were regenerating. They were developing secondary forest and regenerating disturbed primary forest; slow successions were in the process and could be enhanced by ecological restoration. Further botanical explorations in poorly known regions of Sumbawa should be intensified further.

TI  - Functional trajectory for the assessment of ecological restoration success
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration aims to recover an ecosystem to a state before degradation. Comparison to reference ecosystems (old-growth forests) is a key component to define if restoration goals have been achieved ("success"). Nevertheless, it is still unknown how the functional composition of the initial community influences the trajectory of the ecosystem through time. Here, we evaluated restoration success based on the functional trajectory of six 20-year-old forest communities planted in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with distinct combinations of ecological groups (pioneers, secondary, and climax). These six communities ranged their species predominance regarding resource-use strategies, potential size, and functional diversity. To evaluate restoration success, we compared the functional trajectory between the six planted communities after 20 years of secondary succession and calculated their trajectories toward or away from the reference ecosystem. We found that the initial composition influenced the functional trajectory of the communities undergoing restoration and it was a key element to their success. Only the community planted using the highest functional diversity (i.e. pioneer + early and late secondary + climax species) became functionally similar to the reference ecosystem 20 years after planting. The functional trajectories were mostly driven by the mortality of planted individuals than by the colonization of new species. The regeneration is still functionally similar independently of the treatment evidencing little influence of priority effects in this stage of succession. Our study indicated that the initial functional composition of planted forest communities influences the magnitude and direction of their functional trajectory and may influence restoration success.

TI  - Diagnosis and strategies for the conservation or recovery of springs in environments of anthropic pressure
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation and restoration of native vegetation around springs is extremely important to guarantee and maintain the quality and quantity of water resources, having a protective nature in the legal premises of the new Brazilian Forest Code. In this context, the objective of this study was to diagnose and propose actions for the conservation or recovery of native vegetation in the Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) of ten springs located in environments with intense anthropic action (urbanization and mining) in the C & oacute;rrego de Fechos microbasin in Nova Lima- MG. Based on on-site analyses, an environmental diagnosis of the springs and their surroundings was carried out, based on several parameters, such as: forms of land use, conservation status of tree vegetation, natural regeneration, litter, occurrence of invasive species and soil conservation status. The definition of the best forest restoration alternatives was carried out by applying the analytical key by Brancalion et al. (2015). Among the springs evaluated, 07 were classified as little disturbed, 02 as very disturbed and only 01 as degraded, with no spring being diagnosed as preserved. As restoration strategies, favoring the natural regeneration of native species and densification for those springs classified as little or very disturbed are recommended, with enrichment indicated as an additional strategy for those that are very disturbed. As for the spring that is degraded, the introduction of native species in the total area is recommended, with the need to use high species richness.

TI  - Identifying hotspots for ecosystem restoration across heterogeneous tropical savannah-dominated regions
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is high potential for ecosystem restoration across tropical savannah-dominated regions, but the benefits that could be gained from this restoration are rarely assessed. This study focuses on the Brazilian Cerrado, a highly species-rich savannah-dominated region, as an exemplar to review potential restoration benefits using three metrics: net biomass gains, plant species richness and ability to connect restored and native vegetation. Localized estimates of the most appropriate restoration vegetation type (grassland, savannah, woodland/forest) for pasturelands are produced. Carbon sequestration potential is significant for savannah and woodland/forest restoration in the seasonally dry tropics (net biomass gains of 58.2 +/- 37.7 and 130.0 +/- 69.4 Mg ha(-1)). Modelled restoration species richness gains were highest in the central and south-east of the Cerrado for savannahs and grasslands, and in the west and north-west for woodlands/forests. The potential to initiate restoration projects across the whole of the Cerrado is high and four hotspot areas are identified. We demonstrate that landscape restoration across all vegetation types within heterogeneous tropical savannah-dominated regions can maximize biodiversity and carbon gains. However, conservation of existing vegetation is essential to minimizing the cost and improving the chances of restoration success.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Flower and Fruit Availability along a Forest Restoration Gradient
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Frugivores and pollinators are two functional groups of animals that help ensure gene flow of plants among sites in landscapes under restoration and to accelerate restoration processes. Resource availability is postulated to be a key factor to structure animal communities using restoration sites, but it remains poorly studied. We expected that diverse forests with many plant growth forms that have less-seasonal phenological patterns will provide more resources for animals than forests with fewer plant growth forms and strongly seasonal phenological patterns. We studied forests where original plantings included high tree species diversity. We studied resource provision (richness and abundance of flowers and fruits) of all plant growth forms, in three restoration sites of different ages compared to a reference forest, investigating whether plant phenology changes with restoration process. We recorded phenological data for reproductive plant individuals (351 species) with monthly sampling over 2years, and found that flower and fruit production have been recovered after one decade of restoration, indicating resource provision for fauna. Our data suggest that a wide range of plant growth forms provides resource complementarities to those of planted tree species. Different flower phenologies between trees and non-trees seem to be more evident in a forest with high non-tree species diversity. We recommend examples of ideal species for planting, both at the time of initial planting and post-planting during enrichment. These management actions can minimize shortage and periods of resource scarcity for frugivorous and nectarivorous fauna, increasing probability of restoring ecological processes and sustainability in restoration sites.

TI  - Living in a fragmented world: Birds in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - CONDOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is the second largest tropical moist forest domain in South America after the Amazon, home to over 800 bird species (223 endemics or 27% of the avifauna). With only 28% of the original vegetation left, mostly fragmented and altered, the Atlantic Forest is a hotspot for bird conservation. We first introduce the extent, vegetation types, and exploitation history of the domain, and the composition and biogeographic affinities of its birds. We then provide an overview of the knowledge gathered so far on the ways Atlantic Forest birds thrive in the often-fragmented landscape, highlighting the landscape features that influence their occurrence and movement behavior. We end with the conservation issues affecting the Atlantic Forest birds and the actions hitherto taken to address them, including the establishment of conservation units, forest restoration, and rewilding.

TI  - Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.

TI  - Ecosystem restoration job creation potential in Brazil
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The central motivation to restore ecosystems at a planetary scale has been to reverse degradation and provide multiple environmental benefits, but key global players like governments may be more interested in social outcomes from undertaking restoration, such as job creation. Assessing the job opportunities stemming from ongoing restoration programmes can leverage additional investments for their implementation and support their long-term maintenance. Here, we aimed to understand and quantify current and potential ecosystem restoration jobs in Brazil, based on a widely distributed online survey performed in 2020 and led by the main restoration networks in the country. We explored the structure, job distribution and outputs of the national restoration supply chain. At the beginning of 2020, 4713 temporary and 3510 permanent jobs were created, nearly 60% of which were generated by organizations specialized in restoration, mainly from the non-profit (48%) and private (37%) sectors. Restoration jobs were concentrated in organizations working in one (58%) or two (28%) biomes, and the vast majority were in the Atlantic Forest (85%). Similarly, most restoration jobs were concentrated in the southeast region (61%), with one-third in the state of Sao Paulo. This geographical distribution was more strongly associated with the states' GDP than with the legal deficit of native vegetation area. Nearly 20% of the restoration jobs were terminated during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We estimate that restoration activities can generate 0.42 jobs per hectare undergoing restoration, which could potentially create 1.0-2.5 million direct jobs through the implementation of Brazil's target of restoring 12 million hectares. We conclude by reinforcing the value of ecosystem restoration in promoting economic development and job creation, which can be crucial to promote countries' effective engagement in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We also highlight the critical role of grassroots organizations to maximize restoration opportunities for socioeconomic development during the post-pandemic economic recovery.

TI  - Making the most of native seeds: Management techniques interact with seed and seedling traits for enhancing direct seeding success
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding offers a cost-effective approach to large-scale restoration, but seedling establishment can vary greatly across species and regions. This study investigates how management techniques used for seed processing, site preparation, seeding, and post-seeding management interact with seed/seedling traits and influence direct seeding success. We conducted a systematic review of Brazilian direct seeding research, encompassing 26 % of global studies. We focused on paired experiments comparing management techniques against control treatments to analyze seedling establishment rates for trees, shrubs, and palms. The techniques included pre-soaking seeds, overcoming seed dormancy, seed burial, mulch application, soil fertilization, intercropping with green manure or agricultural crops, weed control, and sowing in the shade of secondary vegetation. Seed traits were fresh mass, water content, and shape, and seedling traits were functional morphology, successional guild, and vegetation guild, i.e., forest or savanna. Pre-germination treatments offered no significant benefit. Seed burial doubled establishment, and mulch application only aided unburied seeds. Organic fertilization reduced establishment for savanna species, while intercropping with green manure or crops enhanced establishment for forest species. Weed control effectiveness depended on functional traits. Mowing favored pioneers, while hoeing or herbicide application benefited large-seeded and epigeal-foliaceous-cotyledon seedlings. Pioneer species establishment was 15 % in full sun and 3 % in the shade, while shade-tolerant climax species established at 8 % in full sun and 28 % in the shade. By implementing management techniques, direct seeding success can be increased up to fourfold. This translates to a potential reduction in seed usage, the primary cost of direct seeding, by 25-75 %. These findings pave the way for cost-effective restoration efforts with improved seedling establishment rates.

TI  - Restoration of Araucaria forest:: The role of perches, pioneer vegetation, and soil fertility
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Araucaria forest is Brazil's highly threatened subtropical forest ecosystem that has been disappearing in recent decades. Restoration programs involving this forest type are scarce, and there is a lack of scientific information on how ecological processes such as competition, facilitation, and seed dispersal influence natural forest restoration. This work aims to investigate how use of perches to attract seed dispersers and the influence of pioneer vegetation and soil fertilization could affect the colonization of woody species in a degraded area. An experiment was conducted in an abandoned field where the natural establishment of seeds and seedlings of woody species was monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control); and (3) perches (presence and absence). Seed and seedling abundance, seed and seedling species richness, and seedling mortality were recorded monthly during 12 months. Seed abundance and species richness were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots. These results were consistent over the year and more pronounced when the surrounding forest produced a higher amount of fruit. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots, and in places with vegetation than without. Soil fertility did not influence seedling establishment. Facilitation and seed dispersal are important factors affecting the colonization of woody species in this subtropical area. Nutrient availability neither regulates the facilitation process nor influences species replacement during the early stages of Araucaria forest succession.

M3  - Article
AB  - To accelerate the recovery of degraded environments, it is necessary to use ecological restoration techniques, which require validation according to the ecosystem conditions where are implemented. This work aimed to evaluate soil microbiological attributes under different ecological restoration technologies in a subtropical forest. The study was conducted at UTFPR-DV, southwest of Parana, in an ecotone between Mixed Ombrophilous Forest and Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and on an Oxisol. In December 2010, a tillage area of at least 17 years old was isolated and the passive restoration, tree planting and nucleation treatments were installed in 40x54 m plots and four replications. In November 2018 the soil was sampled in these plots and in a native forest area as a reference. There were calculated soil organic carbon content (OCC) and microbiological attributes such as microbial biomass N and C (N-MIC and C-MIC), basal respiration, fungal spore content and the metabolic (qCO(2)) and microbial quotient (MICq). It can be concluded that nucleation technology can restore soil microbiological attributes but has not yet reached the conditions of a natural environment. Passive restoration is not a good technology for restoring soil microbiological attributes. The higher contents of C-MIC, N-MIC, OCC, MICq and fungal spores in the soil under native forest compared to ecological restoration technologies indicate that eight years of adoption of these techniques have not yet been enough to fully recover soil microbiological activity.

TI  - Soil macrofauna density and diversity across a chronosequence of tropical forest restoration in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Edaphic macrofauna must be better studied if we want to take advantage of their full potential for the restoration of tropical ecosystems. We investigated changes in edaphic macrofauna density and diversity along a secondary succession chronosequence in the Atlantic Forest. Our results show some clear patterns of change in soil macrofauna along the chronosequence. Density did not increase along secondary succession, but was correlated with canopy cover. Diversity was characterized by high dominance of social insects and evenness among other groups. We conclude soil macrofauna has a high capacity to recolonize young forests and that its recovery is considerably fast compared to other ecosystem transformations.

TI  - Use of woody species in the Caatinga dry forest may lead to higher vulnerability to extirpation: An assessment based on ethnobiological, reproductive and conservation criteria
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in maintaining, replenishing and conserving a large portion of the planet's biodiversity. However, these forests have been converted into anthropic landscapes, threatening the persistence of wildlife. The exploitation of forest products can result in different ecological impacts at different levels of biological organization. In this study, we propose a vulnerability index to examine the susceptibility of woody plants used by locals in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (i.e., the Catimbau National Park). We contrasted patterns of (1) plant use by local people (risk of use, collection risk, local importance, and diversity of use), (2) plant reproductive strategies (pollination, sexual and reproductive systems, dispersal mode, flowering and fruiting phenology), and (3) the conservation status of the plant species. We combined this information to propose a vulnerability index expressing species sensitivity to human disturbances in 14 regenerating and 14 old-growth forest stands. We tested the hypothesis that regenerating forest stands will harbor more vulnerable plant species compared to old-growth forest stands. Among the 119 plant species registered in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, 80 species (67.2 %) were recorded as useful for local people in Caatinga. Specifically, about 71.8 % and 70.5 % are exploited by the rural population for some type of use in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, respectively. The most frequent type of use was medicinal, followed by construction and fuel in both regenerating and old-growth forest stands. Regarding the potentially collected plant parts, the total removal of the individual and collection of leaves exhibited similar and higher relevance in regenerating, while leaves were the most collected part in old-growth forest stands. Of the 80 plant species analyzed, 62 % and 58.5 %, respectively, were classified as exhibiting moderate and high vulnerability to extirpation in regenerating and old-growth forest stands; thus not supporting our hypothesis. Our results suggest that in the Caatinga dry forest, (1) woody plant species responsible for forest regeneration in the context of slash- and-burn agriculture are exploited for multiple uses, (2) medicinal use is the main type of use of woody plants occurring in regenerating and old-growth forest stands, (3) total removal of the individual and collection of leaves were the most collected plant parts, and (4) both regenerating and old-growth forest stands showed a high vulnerability to human disturbances in the study area. In the long term, the exploitation of vulnerable plant species may negatively affect the composition and structure of the community and, consequently, the rate and trajectory of succession. It can be expected that as populations of vulnerable plant species are reduced or extirpated from the community, ecological interactions such as pollination and dispersal, which are key to ecosystem maintenance, will change along with the services provided.

TI  - Prioritize grassland restoration to bend the curve of biodiversity loss
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In times of unprecedented climate change, ecological restoration efforts have a strong focus on forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Grasslands, in contrast, remain relatively neglected in global restoration policies. Concurrently, we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis-it is estimated that 1 million species are globally threatened with extinction. Here, we present analyses from central Europe and southern Brazil that show that the majority of our endangered plant species are in fact found in open ecosystems. Using Germany as an example, we show that we could reduce plant extinction risk by up to 82% if we restore open, grassy ecosystems. This also holds true for southern Brazil, where grassland species constitute the single largest share of endangered species, but where grassy ecosystems continue to be systematically neglected by restoration policies. We further expand on our biodiversity argument to include the role that grassland restoration can play in mitigating climate change. We posit that ramping up grassland restoration efforts may not only be our best bet to bend the curve of biodiversity loss, but it will also make a critical contribution to the resilience of ecosystems in the dynamic decades to come. It is time for grassland restoration to receive higher priority in global restoration efforts and policy.

TI  - Does restoration enhance regeneration of seasonal deciduous forests in pastures in central Brazil?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of restoration is to accelerate ecosystem recovery, but in ecosystems that naturally regenerate rapidly restoration techniques need to be selected carefully to facilitate rather than impede natural recovery. We compared the effects of five restoration techniques, such as plowing the soil, removing grasses, adding forest litter, seeding, and planting nursery-growing seedlings, on the regeneration of seasonal deciduous forest trees in four abandoned pastures in central Brazil. We monitored all woody stems immediately prior to treatments and again 14 months after the treatments. We recorded an average of 16,663 tree stems per hectare and a total of 83 species before implementing treatments. Planting strongly increased species richness; adding litter and seeding had weaker positive effects on richness; and plowing and grass removal had no effect. Plowing substantially reduced the density of naturally established stems. Despite the high survival of planted seedlings, stem density in planting treatments did not change because the tractor and digging holes to plant seedlings caused mortality of naturally regenerating seedlings. Tree stems grew more in the grass release plots than in the control plots. Our results suggest that early succession of seasonal deciduous forest in pastures in the region studied does not need to be stimulated once the perturbation is stopped and that intensive restoration efforts may actually slow recovery. We recommend only enrichment planting of seedlings that are not able to resprout.

TI  - The effects of grazing on flowering and fruiting phenology in South Brazilian subtropical grasslands
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - In subtropical grasslands, characterized by the coexistence of species with different physiology, for example C3 and C4 grasses, studies on the reproductive patterns of plants at the community level are scarce. Most available studies are limited to plant -pollinator interactions, and do not include grasses, even though knowledge on phenology of this species group is highly relevant, e.g., for grazing management or ecological restoration. In this study, we monthly evaluated flowering and fruiting in Brazilian subtropical grasslands under different grazing intensities (high, moderate, low, very low, ungrazed) over one year. To estimate the effect of the seasonal variation on the phenology of functional groups (C3 grass, C4 grass, monocots, dicots, shrubs) we used circular statistics. The highest flowering activity occurred in October and November, while fruiting peaked in March and April. Shrubs had the highest number of flowers and fruits, and C4 grasses contributed the largest number of fruiting species. The flowering peak of most functional groups occurred in October, except for C4 grasses and shrubs that peaked in February and November, respectively. Fruiting of C3 grasses peaked in December, C4 grasses and shrubs were most abundant in April and dicots, and monocots peaked in October. Grazing treatments differed considerably in flowering and fruiting patterns for all species groups. Monocots and dicots herbs showed high flowering activity under intense grazing. C3 grasses presented highest peaks in moderate and low grazing intensities, while C4 grasses peaked in very low grazing, and shrubs showed the highest peaks in ungrazed plots. Flowering and fruiting occurred throughout the year in our study system, with clear variation among functional groups in response to climatic and management patterns. Our results can guide seed collection in the field or vegetation cutting for hay transfer, and thus should lead to improvements in the ecological restoration of subtropical grasslands.

TI  - A Contemporary Assessment of Change in Humid Tropical Forests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades the rate and geographic extent of land-use and land-cover change has increased throughout the world's humid tropical forests. The pan-tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long-term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large-scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small-scale deforestation, low-intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting. Our results highlight the enormous geographic extent of forest change throughout the humid tropics and the considerable limitations of the science and technology available for such a synthesis.

TI  - Attributes of stand-age-dependent forest determine technosol fertility of Atlantic forest re-growing on mining tailings in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how soil fertility changes due to environmental conditions and stand-age-dependent forest attributes is important for local-scale forest restoration. We evaluated the effects of stand-age-dependent forest attributes (plant community composition and litter stock) on soil and technosol fertility across two second-growth Atlantic forests (SGF) after the deposition of mining tailings in Mariana, southeastern Brazil. We hypothesized that technosol fertility in the SGF tailings is positively affected by plant community composition variability, stand age, and litter stock. We used total exchangeable bases and organic matter as fertility indicators for technosol and soil, and species composition and litter stock as stand-age-dependent forest attributes. Our results showed significant differences in the stand-age-dependent forest attributes and soil chemical properties between the two forest patches (SGF tailing and SGF non-tailing) evaluated. Thus, there was a marked gradient of litter storage and fertility between soil and technosol that can be important forest recovery indicators for the affected plant communities. Furthermore, according to the tested models, we corroborated the hypothesis that technosol fertility is positively affected by stand age, plant community composition variability, and litter stock, which may contribute considerably to forest recovery on tailings. Our results demonstrate that the fertility predictors analyzed to explain the forest recovery on tailings can also be considered as ecological indicators for assessing forest restoration in areas impacted by mining tailings in Mariana.

TI  - Soil organic carbon, microbial biomass and enzyme activities responses to natural regeneration in a tropical dry region in Northeast Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration may be a cost-effective method for recovering areas previously used for intensive agricultural purposes. Plant diversity in the succession periods has been well documented; however, less attention has been paid to the changes in soil attributes, which may work as an instrument for the validation of regeneration methods. The present study is part of a broader interdisciplinary research project assessing the effects of natural regeneration on biodiversity and the quality of the soil. We investigated the effects of natural regeneration on the physicochemical attributes of the soil, as well as on soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme attributes. We assessed three stages and five areas of each natural regeneration stage (early-ER, intermediate-IR and late-LR) in two layers: 0-5 and 5-10 cm. The present study found a 20% SOC increase due to natural regeneration. In the first layer, SOC, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase absolute activities were significantly higher in the two older natural regeneration stages (IR and LR) than those found in the ER stage. We found a reduction in specific enzyme activities per SOC unit in the ER areas. Natural regeneration influenced SOC and MBC, the absolute enzyme activities, and the specific enzymes per SOC unit, mainly in the surface layer. The present study provided some of the first data concerning the beneficial effects of natural regeneration on the quality of soil as measured through enzyme activity, SOC and MBC in a tropical dry region in Northeastern Brazil.

TI  - Vegetation Succession on Degraded Sites in the Pomacochas Basin (Amazonas, N Peru)-Ecological Options for Forest Restoration
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andes of northern Peru are still widely covered with forests, but increasingly suffer from habitat fragmentation. Subsequent soil degradation often leads to the abandonment of overused forests and pastures. Ecological knowledge on the restoration potential, e.g., on dependencies of soil conditions and altitude, is scarce. Therefore, we compared soil and vegetation patterns along nine transects within the upper Pomacochas Basin, which is an important biodiversity corridor along the Andes, between remaining forests, succession sites and pastures. Anthropogenic successional and disturbance levels, geological substrate, and altitude have the most important ecological impacts on vegetation and tree species composition. Species responded to sandstone versus calcareous substrates, but also to depths of the organic soil layer, and light conditions. The absence of organic layers under pastures contrasted with the accumulation of thick organic layers under forest cover. Vegetation composition at succession sites revealed certain starting points (herbal stage, bush stage, or secondary forest) for restoration that will determine the length of regeneration paths. Pre-forest patches of Alchornea sp. and Parathesis sp. may act as habitat stepping stones for expeditiously restoring biocorridors for wildlife. The key findings can contribute to the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity in a fragile ecoregion.

TI  - Survival and carbon stock of forest species in mixed plantation at 8 years of age
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations that aim to neutralize carbon contribute to climate change mitigation by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fixing it in its biomass. Climate change mitigation via forest restoration is still a practice that needs scientific advances. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the survival and carbon stock of forest species in carbon offset plantation at eight years. The planting took place in December 2010 to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions related to an event at the Federal University of Vicosa in Vicosa-MG. Two hundred and eleven planted seedlings of sixteen Atlantic Forest species had their survival and carbon stock assessed at eight years, aiming to understand the species' carbon removal. The inventory was carried out annually from 2011 (12 months of age) to 2018 (96 months). Diameter at ground height (DAS in mm) and total height (H in m) data were collected. Survival at the end of the eighth year was 52.30% (180 individuals). The evaluated species, Albizia niopoides, Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, Senna multijuga and Enterolobium contortisiliquum did not show mortality rates. Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, Anadenanthera colubrina, Ateleia glazioveana and Citharexylum myrianthum stood out as species with the highest carbon stock at 8 years of age. The pioneer species obtained the highest carbon stock and survival, while the species with the lowest stock were the non -pioneer species. Thus, species that have the greatest carbon stock and potential for the implementation of restoration and carbon neutralization projects are S. multijuga, S. polyphyllum, A. glazioveana e A. colubrina, due to the high survival and carbon storage of these species.

TI  - Forest recovery prognostics in conservation units of the Atlantic rainforest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growth models can provide valuable support tools for forest recovery assessment and forestry management, whether in the form of diagnostic or prognostic. Furthremore, they can be applied to characterize each phytophysiognomy in terms of vegetation growth parameters that and can be applied to gauge the spatiotemporal progress of recovery processes. Up to date, such parameters remain mostly unknown. In this paper, we explore a modelling framework aimed at providing computer-aided prognostics of forest recovery based on the diffusive-logistic growth (DLG) model and present case studies for a number of four preservation areas located in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest biome. The modelling framework involves the application of vegetation indices derived from satellite images and a computational implementation of the DLG model. The objective of the study is to illustrate how forest restoration and recovery projects could gain from the proposed methodology, due to the fact that the likely outcomes of management practices could be assessed in advance. Additionally, it aims to determine the characteristic parameters of forest growth for a portion of the Atlantic rainforest biome. The diffusion and growth rate parameters from the DLG model were calibrated and they show the evolution of forest density over the years. The results show that the forest recovery process can take several decades to stabilize in the absence of negative interventions in the forest growth. The model and the implementation presented in this work are freely available and they can be an important tool for decision and policy making in what concerns forest recovery.

TI  - Definition of priority areas for soil and water conservation in the Itangua watershed, Capao Bonito, SP state, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The improper soil use may lead to erosion and silting of watercourses, reducing the quantity and the quality of water in the watershed. The implementation of soil conservation practices and the presence of native vegetation are crucial for soil and water conservation in the basin, since they act by decreasing water runoff and erosion. This study aimed to develop a map of priority areas for soil and water conservation in the Itangua. watershed, Capao Bonito, SP state, based on the characterization of the use and land cover and slope of the basin and, define areas with a high need to implement conservation practices. For the creation of thematic maps with the information plans of land use, land cover and declivity were combined by the Boolean method on a geographic information system. After the analysis, it was found nine different priority classes for the implementation of conservation practices and six priority classes for forest restoration in the permanent preservation area. Areas with a dirt road in a region of higher declivity were identified as priority areas for conservation, including the permanent preservation area along watercourses in the basin. The study provides the first assessment of the land use and land cover at the basin level for Capao Bonito National Forest and provides a basis for identifying conservation priorities across the Itangua basin.

TI  - Structure and genetic diversity of natural Brazilian pepper populations (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi)
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of a possible loss of genetic diversity in plants due the environmental changes, actions to ensure the genetic variability are an urgent necessity. The extraction of Brazilian pepper fruits is a cause of concern because it results in the lack of seeds in soil, hindering its distribution in space and time. It is important to address this concern and explore the species, used by riparian communities and agro-factories without considering the need for keeping the seeds for natural seed banks and for species sustainability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure and the genetic diversity in natural Brazilian pepper populations (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi). Twenty-two alleles in 223 individuals were identified from eight forest remnants located in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe. All populations presented loci in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium deviation. Four populations presented six combinations of loci in linkage disequilibrium. Six exclusive alleles were detected in four populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed the absence of diversity between regions and that between the populations (G(ST)) was 41%. Genetic diversity was structured in seven clusters (Delta K7). Brazilian pepper populations were not structured in a pattern of isolation by distance and present genetic bottleneck. The populations Sao Mateus, Canastra, Barbacena, and Ilha das Flores were identified as management units and may support conservation projects, ecological restoration and in implementation of management plans for Brazilian pepper in the State of Sergipe.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Habitat Use of an Asian Elephant in Sumatra.
T2  - Animals
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, habitat fragmentation caused by agricultural and human development has forced Sumatran elephants into relatively small areas, but there is little information on how elephants use these areas and thus, how habitats can be managed to sustain elephants in the future. Using a Global Positioning System (GPS) collar and a land cover map developed from TM imagery, we identified the habitats used by a wild adult female elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) in the Seblat Elephant Conservation Center, Bengkulu Province, Sumatra during 2007-2008. The marked elephant (and presumably her 40-60 herd mates) used a home range that contained more than expected medium canopy and open canopy land cover. Further, within the home range, closed canopy forests were used more during the day than at night. When elephants were in closed canopy forests they were most often near the forest edge vs. in the forest interior. Effective elephant conservation strategies in Sumatra need to focus on forest restoration of cleared areas and providing a forest matrix that includes various canopy types.

TI  - Metabarcoding of Soil Fungal Communities in Rupestrian Grassland Areas Preserved and Degraded by Mining: Implications for Restoration
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rupestrian grasslands are vegetation complexes of the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savanna), exhibiting simultaneously great biodiversity and important open-pit mining areas. There is a strong demand for the conservation of remaining areas and restoration of degraded. This study evaluated, using next-generation sequencing, the diversity and ecological aspects of soil fungal communities in ferruginous rupestrian grassland areas preserved and degraded by bauxite mining in Brazil. In the preserved and degraded area, respectively, 565 and 478 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were detected. Basidiomycota and Ascomycota comprised nearly 72% of the DNA, but Ascomycota showed greater abundance than Basidiomycota in the degraded area (64% and 10%, respectively). In the preserved area, taxa of different hierarchical levels (Agaromycetes, Agaricales, Mortierelaceae, and Mortierella) associated with symbiosis and decomposition were predominant. However, taxa that colonize environments under extreme conditions and pathogens (Dothideomycetes, Pleoporales, Pleosporaceae, and Curvularia) prevailed in the degraded area. The degradation reduced the diversity, and modified the composition of taxa and predominant ecological functions in the community. The lack of fungi that facilitate plant establishment and development in the degraded area suggests the importance of seeking the restoration of this community to ensure the success of the ecological restoration of the environment. The topsoil of preserved area can be a source of inocula of several groups of fungi important for the restoration process but which occur in low abundance or are absent in the degraded area.

TI  - A review of the freshwater diversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana): taxonomic composition, ecology, comparison with similar systems and conservation status
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Freshwater organisms in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami (Botswana) provide direct and indirect benefits to people and the economy of the region. However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region.

TI  - Response of birds to high biodiversity silvopastoral systems: Integrating food production and biodiversity conservation through applied nucleation in southern Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of a landscape's matrix is a key condition for the conservation of biodiversity and affects the diversity and composition of bird assemblages in agricultural landscapes with forest remnants. In southern Brazil most agricultural landscapes are a mosaic of cultivated areas, treeless pastures and forest remnants. These landscapes must be planned and managed for food production while synergically enhancing ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we compared the diversity and composition of bird species in High Biodiversity Silvopastoral Systems (SPSnuclei), treeless pasture areas, forest edges and forest interiors. SPSnuclei is a type of silvopastoral system (SPS) whose design was inspired by applied nucleation reforestation techniques using multispecies agroforestry nuclei. In this study, we sought to understand the influence of the SPSnuclei on the diversity and composition of birds by comparing SPSnuclei to treeless pasture areas, forest edges and the forest interior. We hypothesize that multispecies agroforestry nuclei would restore some of the ecosystem biodiversity, and therefore resilience. To quantify bird diversity, sound recorders were installed simultaneously within these habitats during the spring and summer of 2016 and 2017 on three dairy farms. We identified calls from 108 bird species in 2400 min of recordings (600 min/habitat). The High Biodiversity Silvopastoral System increased the diversity of birds in the agroecosystem. Species richness was higher in the parcels with SPSnuclei compared to treeless pastures (P < 0,05). Although, species richness was smaller in the SPSnuclei than forest edge and interior of the forest remnants (P < 0,05). Eight species from the interior and forest edge were observed in the SPSnuclei, but not in the treeless pastures. This research presents evidence that SPSnuclei has positive effects on the diversity and composition of the avifauna in agricultural landscapes and could act as stepping stones that increase connectivity between forest remnants.

TI  - Evolution of Soil Chemical Fertility in an Area under Recovery for 30 Years with Anthropic Intervention
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation and application of recovery techniques associated with the use of qualitative and quantitative indicators enable the ecological restoration of these sites. In this context, the main difficulty consists of establishing the A horizon, capable of supporting the emergence of other horizons, choosing appropriate species, and adding organic matter to the soil in a balanced way. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate over time (1992 to 2022) the chemical properties of a stripped oxisol that has been in the recovery process for 30 years, using liming, gypsum, and plant species. All treatments were cultivated with Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) in 1999 and tree species in 2010, and the contents of phosphorus, organic matter, pH, and base saturation. ANOVA and Scott-Knott test (5%), Pearson correlation, and response surface analysis were performed for each studied soil attribute. The results showed that the treatments with green manure + limestone + gypsum had the highest values of organic matter compared to the recovery treatments and that the treatments have been efficient in soil recovery. Therefore, the soil undergoing recovery showed an increase in P, OM, pH, and base saturation until 2011, and the response surface method was the most efficient in analyzing the results over time.

TI  - Restoring Brazil's road margins could help the country offset its CO2 emissions and comply with the Bonn and Paris Agreements
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambitious aims have been set for the ecological restoration of degraded land worldwide. The first step to reach this goal is to identify suitable areas for restoration. Here, we advocate for the restoration of roadsides, an often neglected landscape that is usually degraded. Using Brazil as an example, we calculate the potential of roadside restoration for carbon storage, and discuss other additional positive environmental impacts. We show that in Brazil more than 566 thousand hectares of roadsides along federal and state highways are potentially available for restoration. This corresponds to a sequestration of up to 55.3 million tons of carbon, representing up to US$26.5 billion in the carbon market. Additional benefits would include erosion control, prevention of landslides, increased landscape value, pollinator habitat provisioning, and contribution to biodiversity conservation. We push for roadside restoration for its many environmental benefits and other practical reasons: roadsides in Brazil are governmentally owned, reducing the needing for negotiations with stakeholders in proposed interventions. Roadside restoration, however, is unlikely to re-establish predisturbance ecosystem conditions in all cases, but it may significantly contribute to biodiversity conservation, for instance, by providing habitat and increasing ecological connectivity for specific taxa and biomes. Thus, the restoration of roadsides in Brazil represents an immense potential for carbon sequestration, with other important environmental benefits. Proper management is necessary, and concrete strategies and goals in restoration planning will vary among different Brazilian biomes. The restoration of these currently undervalued public lands can make the financial and environmental benefits of land restoration evident to stakeholders and thus stimulate ecological restoration.

TI  - PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL AND PHYTOGEOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF A RIPARIAN FOREST SECTOR IN ALFREDO WAGNER, SANTA CATARINA STATE, AS SUBSIDY FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of floristic and structure of tree communities is essential to subside the strategies of forest restoration. In this sense, a phyto-sociological survey was conducted in a forest fragment situated along a tributary of Caete river, in Alfredo Wagner, state of Santa Catarina, in order to: i) know the structure of trees and flora in this forest, ii) classify the species found according to ecological groups and iii) compare the flora of the study area with other studies in Araucaria forest (FOM), Atlantic Rain Forest (FOD) and the transition area between FOM-FOD of Santa Catarina state. In this fragment, 10 plots of 400 m(2) were allocated, where all individual trees with the circumference at breast height (CBH, measured at 1.30 m above the ground) greater than or equal to 15.7 cm were measured, marked and identified. The species were classified into the following succession groups: pioneer, climax light-demanding or climax shade-tolerant. The Rectified Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used for the floristic comparison. The structure of the tree component was described by the density, frequency, dominance and importance value (VI). The results showed elevated species richness (98 species). It was found typical species of FOM, such as Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) Kuntze, and species characteristics of FOD such as Byrsonima ligustrifolia A. Juss., confirming the study fragment as an area of ecological tension between FOM and FOD. The species with most elevated VI were Psychotria vellosiana Benth., Alsophila setosa Kaulf. and Guatteria australis A. St.-Hil. The species with elevated VI, for their considerable representation in the area, are important in the restoration of degraded riparian forests in the region. The species seedlings plantation should be planned observing the group successional of each species, planting pioneer and light-demanding climax species first (e.g. Psychotria vellosiana), followed by, after the shading of the area, shade-tolerant species (e.g. Alsophila setosa e Guatteria australis).

TI  - Beauty before age: landscape factors influence bird functional diversity in naturally regenerating fragments, but regeneration age does not
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective ecological restoration actions should be able to recover ecosystem processes that influence community development in the long term. However, there is scarce information on how landscape factors promote or accelerate fauna recovery. We used a landscape framework to evaluate how functional groups respond to natural regeneration in a highly fragmented region of Atlantic Forest. Using bird functional groups sampled in 15 regenerating forest fragments, we built and ranked models using a model selection approach to test the relative effect of landscape variables on each group. Our results showed that bird community recovery is not determined by the duration of the regeneration process (i.e. forest age), but by how the species responds to the landscape context. Functional diversity and the abundance of the functional groups were mainly related to composition metrics, whereas the functional metric affected only specific groups. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the landscape level to ensure both the colonization of fauna and the restoration of ecological functions.

TI  - Use of geotextile collars in the revegetation of a fragment of gallery forest in the Brasilia Botanical Garden, Brazil: seedlings survival and development
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have caused damage to Cerrado, the second largest Brazilian biome. Among the most threatened Cerrado phyto-physiognomies stand out gallery forests. Many projects have aimed at gallery forest restoration, but herb invasion hinders the establishment and development of Cerrado woody species. In this scenario, 2 ha of gallery forest along Cabeca de Veado stream within the Brasilia Botanical Garden were cleared for subsistence agriculture and the area was subsequently dominated by Melinis minutiflora Beauv. (molasses grass). Some attempts at site restoration have failed due to competition between M. minutiflora and planted tree seedlings. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of using geotextile collars made of natural fibers on survival and development of Cerrado tree seedlings introduced in the area dominated by molasses grass. Seedlings of third native tree species were planted in holes chemically fertilized, and half of seedlings received geotextile collars while the other half did not for experimental control purpose. Four surveys were carried out, when survival, seedling height and diameter were measured. Results indicate that the geotextile collars increased seedlings survival in 19.6% and seven out third species achieved greater al-lometric increment from the use of geotextile collars. Increments of two species were higher in the absence of collars and the increment of half of species was not significantly affect by the geotextile protection.

TI  - Regeneration of riparian forests of the Brazilian Pantanal under flood and fire influence
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood and fire are considered ecological filters and can shape the structure of plant communities in tropical wetlands and floodable savannas, especially on regeneration. However, in systems exposed to recurrent flood and fire, there is little information on the vegetation effects and implications for management. To test the effects of fire on flood-prone riparian forests of the Brazilian Pantanal, we analyzed how natural flood and fire can interact and influence species composition, abundance, and richness of the woody regeneration. This neotropical savanna wetland is subjected to annual and predictable flood pulses and to occasional wildfires. We established 106 plots (2 x 5 m) within the riparian forest of the Paraguay River in burned (recurrent) and unburned areas from 2001 to 2011 (verified on satellite images). We compared the plot topography with historic data of river levels from Ladario gauge in the same period. We sampled all trees, shrubs, and lianas from 0.3 to 2.5 m high. Flood in plots varied from 38 (higher areas) to 98 (lower areas) days year(-1). Our results show that variation in flood duration and occurrence of fire interact in a synergistic manner to reduce stem numbers on regeneration and modify species composition and distribution. Species richness differed in relation to flood duration, but not to fire. All growth forms had low number of exclusive species in both unburned and burned sites. Our results have implications for wetland management. The natural flooding regime is responsible for the diversity of habitats and species. Changes of the hydrology due to land management or climatic changes may result in changes of fire regime with consequences for the analyzed vegetation patterns and ecosystem functions. This neotropical savanna wetland system is stable and resilient as long as its natural patterns and periodicities of flooding and wildfires are maintained. Our results point to the necessity to analyze the interacting effects of selective environmental forces in order to be able to preserve the form and functions of the huge wetlands of the Pantanal.

TI  - Conditions influencing the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in South America's commodity frontiers
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing large-scale deforestation in commodity frontiers remains a key challenge for climate change mitigation and the conservation of biodiversity. Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Forest fragments, primary and secondary forests harbour similar arthropod assemblages after 40 years of landscape regeneration in the Central Amazon
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale deforestation leads to habitat loss and fragmentation with major consequences for biodiversity. However, the impacts of these environmental disturbances can be mitigated by forest regeneration. We evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and vegetation recovery on arthropod assemblages in human-modified landscapes in the Amazon. Arthropods were sampled in 10-ha forest fragments, continuous primary forests, and secondary forests using Malaise traps. We identified arthropods in multiple taxonomic resolutions from order to species. We collected 25,230 arthropods belonging to 17 orders. Coleoptera and Hemiptera were more abundant in secondary forests compared to other habitats. A dipteran family (Clusiidae) and a horse fly species (Dichelacera cervicornis-Tabanidae) were identified as indicators of forest fragments and continuous forests, respectively. Similar levels of taxonomic diversity between habitats were documented. The taxonomic composition also was similar between studied habitats in all taxonomic resolutions. Although the studied landscapes suffered strong environmental disturbances four decades ago, the vegetation has been in continuous regeneration since then, favouring the dispersal of arthropods throughout habitats. Forest fragments and old secondary forests contribute to the maintenance of a rich and diverse arthropod assemblage in landscapes composed of large tracts of continuous primary forests.

TI  - High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD $8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector.

TI  - Technical assessment and decision making for the environmental recovery of waterways and their banks: a science-based protocol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The poor management of aquatic ecosystems often results in environmental degradation, which requires actions for its recovery. A field protocol was elaborated to guide users (restorationists) to assess degraded areas and provide site- and situation-specific interventionist actions. The protocol was developed following the plant or animal taxonomy framework by Linnaeus, considering that the first character has two mutually exclusive possibilities. It was elaborated in three parts: (1) a technical glossary, (2) a hierarchical key, and (3) a set of intervention actions that are indicated according to the case. Complementarily, ten degraded sites (lentic or lotic ecosystem), all located in continental regions of the Brazilian territory, were evaluated using this key. The protocol was thought to be applied to continental and superficial water bodies. It starts separating the lotic and lentic ecosystems, and after each part goes for specific ways, all of them finishing in one or more interventionist action(s). The set of actions presented is composed of fourteen scenarios, seven of them to be implemented on-site, five to be implemented off-site, and two to be implemented on- and/or off-site. The intervention actions range from simply monitoring, to revegetation of the riparian zone, to activities that target the reoxygenation of hypolimnion. The study cases exemplify the use of the key and provide insight into the required adjustments for the implementation of intervention actions. The protocol and guidelines presented here will allow in a systematic manner, assess and compare the outcomes and efficiency of river restoration projects, locally, regionally and internationally.

TI  - Ultrastructural and functional chloroplast changes promoting photoacclimation after forest management in a tropical secondary forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management involving the selective logging of exotic species in order to reestablish native flora alters microclimatic conditions and selects for species with heightened capacity to adapt to the new conditions. This study investigated whether, after forest management involving the removal of eucalyptus, ultrastructural adjustments in the chloroplast fostered the photoacclimation of the most abundant regenerating native species in a Brazilian Atlantic forest biological reserve. The influence of seasonality on photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency after the forest management was also assessed. To achieve this, in the rainy season mature leaves of native tree saplings (Xylopia sericea, Siparuna guianensis, and Byrsonima sericea) were subjected to ultrastructural analyses and the C isotopic composition (delta C-13) was determined; and in the dry and rainy season gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured. Species samples were obtained in: secondary forest, a eucalyptus understory with 15 years of regeneration before and 12 months after the management, and from herbarium samples from eucalyptus understories collected at the beginning of forest regeneration (9-16 years ago, for delta C-13 analyses only). Ultrastructural alterations such as the reorganization of thylakoids, starch grain changes, and the presence of plastoglobules and oils were verified after the management in all the species. F-v/F-m, values varied between 0.80 and 0.90 regardless of the management or season of the year. There was a reduction of C assimilation after the management, especially in the dry season. C-13 enrichment was observed for B. sericea, S. guianensis, and X. sericea in herbarium samples (-31.4 parts per thousand, -32.0 parts per thousand, and -31.4 parts per thousand, respectively) and after the forest management (-31.2 parts per thousand, -32.5 parts per thousand, -31.4 parts per thousand), while samples depleted in 13C were registered before the management (-33.4 parts per thousand, -33.3 parts per thousand, -33.2 parts per thousand) and in the secondary forest (-34.0 parts per thousand, -33.9 parts per thousand, and -33.6 parts per thousand). The data suggest that ultrastructural alterations may have aided in maintaining electron flow after the increase in irradiance due to the forest management, avoiding photochemical stress, as evidenced by Fv/Fm values. The forest management increased the efficiency of water use and fostered abiotic conditions similar to those present at the beginning of the understory regeneration. These previous conditions favored the current high level of abundance of these three species, highlighting the importance of monitoring to ensure that the management practices do not promote the future dominance of few species at the expense this biome's high biodiversity.

TI  - Use of artificial perches for wild birds in a degraded area in southern Brazil.
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - . One of the major setbacks in environmental restoration is how to promote the arrival of propagules in degraded areas, and this issue is intensified at sites without vegetation, where natural dispersal is limited. To overcome this issue, one of the methods employed is the use of artificial perches, intended for attracting seeddispersing birds, providing perching sites, and thus, facilitating the formation of vegetation nuclei from the seeds that are excreted, regurgitated, or accidentally dropped. The aim of this study was to quantify and identify the birds that used the artificial perches in a degraded area on the margins of the Forqueta River, RS, Brazil, in order to evaluate their effectiveness as an ecological restoration method. Over one year, 11 bird species were observed to use the perches. Despite the presence of birds, there was no significant seed germination at the base of the perches. Absence of frugivorous species and adverse conditions of the soil might have contributed to this result. Previous studies showed diverging results on the effectiveness of artificial perches, indicating the need for considering several factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of invasive species. The present study highlights the complexity of ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded areas and the importance of adaptive approaches to reach effective results.

TI  - CONTRIBUTION OF ARTIFICIAL PERCHES TO SEED DISPERSAL AND ITS APPLICATION TO FOREST RESTORATION
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of artificial perches is an efficient technique to forest restoration. We aimed to (1) evaluate the effect of the presence of artificial perches on the number of forest seeds deposited on seed fall collectors, (2) identify the seed dispersal syndromes, and (3) to analyze the effect of distance from the forest border on seed input. Field work was performed in the municipality of Iguaba Grande, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We installed 70 seed fall collectors (with diameter of 0.50 m) distributed in transects parallelly distant 5, 15 e 35 m from the forest border in abandoned pasture, and in one transect 10 m from the border, in the forest interior. Each transect outside the forest patch received ten seed fall collectors, installed under artificial perches, and ten seed fall collectors, installed without perches. In the forest interior, we installed ten collectors. During three weeks of sampling, we obtained 418 seeds, classified into 242 zoochoric seeds (57.9%) and 176 anemochoric seeds (42.1%). The average seed with the presence of artificial perch was 7.4 (+/- 3.9) seeds/m(2)/month while in the absence of artificial perch the average was 1.7 (+/- 1.8) seeds/m(2)/month, considering anemochoric and zoochoric seeds. Different distances from the forest edge, up to 35 m, did not influence the number of zoochoric and anemochoric seeds. The presence of artificial perches increased at 118 times the number of seeds dispersed by animals when compared to traps without perches. Artificial perches work as catalyzing structures for forest restoration, with a significant increase in the input of zoochoric seeds.

TI  - Assessing carbon sequestration in a high-diversity restoration plantation in the Atlantic Forest of southwestern Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration spotlights the urgent need for global efforts to restore ecosystems and mitigate climate change. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha-1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha-1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative.

TI  - Monitoring restored tropical forest diversity and structure through UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensors, onboard orbital platforms, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance our understanding of changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function of forests, offering multi-scale monitoring of forest restoration. UAV systems can generate highresolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data-canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI-and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data-15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of UAV-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale.

TI  - Diversity, genetic structure, and population genomics of the tropical tree Centrolobium tomentosum in remnant and restored Atlantic forests
T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid pace of deforestation and fragmentation that took place in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and other global hotspots for biodiversity conservation has motivated ecosystem restoration efforts. The genetic viability of restored tree populations and their potential to conserve genetic diversity remains, however, unclear. Here, we assessed the genetic viability and potential to conserve the genetic diversity of restored populations of Centrolobium tomentosum, a native legume tree, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, based on a genotyping by sequencing (GBS). We have successfully generated a total of 2877 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the whole C. tomentosum genome. Surprisingly, restoration sites presented overall higher levels of genetic diversity compared to natural remnant areas and negative inbreeding coefficient (F-IS), mainly in juveniles' trees from newer restored areas, indicating an excess of heterozygotes probably due to the founding event. The most likely number of genetic clusters found was two (K = 2), suggesting that diverse seed sources were used to produce seedlings for restoration. Clear signs of gene flow from restored to natural remnants areas had also been detected when diversity values of adults and juveniles were contrasted. Even though we did not find any clear relation of the genetic diversity and landscape composition, the low percentage of forest and high levels of fragmentation are likely reducing patch connectivity in some areas. LOSITAN detected 88 SNP outliers under positive selection, but analysis with Bayescan failed to support this evidence. In conclusion, our post hoc evaluation of restored tree populations indicated that the old restored area is stable and new areas have great potential to contribute to conserving genetic diversity and increasing the chances of the natural populations to persist over time.

TI  - Control strategies of Urochloa spp. in the formation of forest restoration
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration in pastures dominated by Urochloa spp. (brachiaria) shows relatively high cost, mainly by the difficulty of controlling this weed. The objective of this work was to determine the most efficient brachyria control for forest restoration formation. Four different strategies for brachiaria control in the forest restoration area were compared in the city of Bom Jardim, Rio de Janeiro state: T1 weeding in strips in the planting lines and mowed between the lines; T2 weeding in strips in the planting lines and applications of glyphosate (1.44 kg i.a. ha(-1)) between the lines; T3- weeding in total area and consortium with herbaceous legumes nitrogen-fixing; T4- weeding in strips in the planting lines, mowing and consortium with eucalyptus between the lines. The growth in height, the diameter at ground level and the diameter of the top of ten forest species at different ages were evaluated, as well as all costs involved in the application and maintenance of each treatment, up to 30 months after planting. In every age of valuation, forest plants showed significantly higher average growth in height and diameter at the ground level in the treatment of consortium with herbaceous legumes and application of glyphosate. At 24 months after planting, the top of the trees that were introduced had already covered 80% to 90% of the area of experimental unit that received the T3 (legumes) and T2 (Glyphosate) treatments, respectively. However, the maintenance cost of the T3 was almost double the T1 units and the cost of the latter was almost three times higher than the units analyzed for T2. As a general rule, eucalyptus consortium between the lines of planting did not harm, but also did not benefit the growth of the native species planted up to 30 months after planting. Chemical control and consortium with herbaceous legumes can be pointed as effective alternatives to control the brachiaria of this area, anticipating the formation of stands and resulting in resource savings.

TI  - Early responses of regeneration to weeding and herbicide application to control Guinea-grass in a 20-year-old Atlantic Forest undergoing restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the invasive grasses harming natural ecosystems in Brazil, Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus) has received significant attention due to its high invasive potential and damage it causes to restoration sites. Here, we show the response of seedlings (10 cm to 1 m) and saplings (>1 m) one year after Guinea-grass removal in a 20-year-old restoration site in the Atlantic Forest. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were installed and assigned into three treatments: control, mechanical removal using gas-trimmers, and mechanical removal followed by the application of Roundup Transorb R (glyphosate). Forest canopy and grass cover were also assessed. Guinea-grass was negatively correlated with woody species richness and abundance. Forest canopy cover was positively related to species richness and abundance, and negatively related to Guinea-grass. Treatments applied were successful in controlling the plant invader and did not cause any significant reduction in the total abundance or richness of saplings after one year. For seedlings, however, the abundance and richness of pioneer woody species increased over time with mechanical removal, while the abundance and richness of non-pioneer woody species decreased in plots treated with herbicide. We expect regeneration responses to continue to improve with time. Our results support the use of both herbicide and mechanical removal to reduce Guinea-grass in Atlantic Forest sites undergoing restoration, although the use of herbicide lowers native seedling richness in the short-term, while mechanical removal may be better for small sites, where it is more feasible and less demanding.

TI  - Influence of soil characteristics on physiological and growth responses of Cytharexyllum myrianthum Cham. (Verbenaceae) to flooding
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of watershed riparian forest restoration programs can be affected by the selection of plant species tolerant to flooding and soil types that occur along water courses. We evaluated physiological and growth responses of Cytharexyllum myrianthum seedlings to flooding in three different soil types representative of the Almada River Watershed (ARW), southern Bahia, Brazil. The soils selected, based on the relative abundance and importance in the ARW, were: Luvisol, Argisol, and Spodosol. After 35 days of flooding, the Argisol had the lowest and the Spodosol had the highest reduction-oxidation (redox) potential (E-h). After 35 days of flooding, the Luvisol had higher pH and electrical conductivity (E-c) than the other soils. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthesis (A) significantly declined in all soil types after 7 days of flooding. After that period, morphological changes characteristic of flood-tolerant plants, such as lenticel hypertrophy and adventitious root formation, were observed in all flooded plants. Following the morphological changes, g(s) and A in flooded plants increased to values close to those of the non-flooded plants. The highest relative growth rates based on mass (RGRm) and net assimilation rates (NAR) for the non-flooded plants were observed in the Argisol. After 35 days of flooding, no significant differences in RGRm or NAR were observed between non-flooded and flooded plants in the Luvisol, but large significant decreases in RGRm and NAR were observed for the flooded plants in the Spodosol. Our results demonstrated that the ability of seedlings of the same species to acclimate to flooded soil conditions differs among soil types. Therefore, the characteristics of soils present in a watershed should be considered when selecting tree species for the reforestation of riparian forests.

TI  - Natural Regeneration in Plantations of Native Trees in Lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Community Structure, Diversity, and Dispersal Syndromes
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations of native-tree species are often recommended for ecological restoration, but the understanding of how these techniques catalyze natural ecological processes is limited. We investigated natural regeneration in five plantations of native trees in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve (PABR) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The plantations were 9-11 years old, and contained 8-14 native-tree species with different compositions and relative density of species. We analyzed floristic composition, structure (density and basal area) of overstory and understory strata, as well as other ecological attributes (dispersal syndromes, fruit or seed size, and the availability of fruit for frugivores). Zoochorous species comprised 77% of the community, with a prevalence of the two smallest size classes of propagules (< 0.6 and 0.6-1.6 cm) in natural regeneration. The density of zoochorous plants in the understory was positively correlated with their density in the overstory, indicating their influence on natural regeneration (r2 = 0.36; p < 0.0002). Fruit availability for frugivores (density and richness of plants fruiting during the year) was also positively correlated with the density of stems in the understory. Therefore, attributes such as dispersal syndrome and fruiting season should be considered in selecting species to be planted. The differences in natural regeneration observed in each of the native-tree plantations indicated that the performance of plantations as a restoration strategy may differ, depending on initial species composition, planting density, and site conditions.

TI  - Survival and growth of tree seedlings as a function of seed size in a gallery forest under restoration
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed size is commonly related to higher rates of emergence and survival, and biomass of seedlings when introduced by direct seeding. However, few studies have evaluated whether this relationship persists when species are reintroduced as seedlings or if this effect persists after seed reserves decline. This study evaluated the effect of seed size (mass) on the probability of survival and growth of seedlings of nine native tree species introduced into a pasture area, which was originally a gallery forest in the state of Sao Paulo in Southeastern Brazil. The experiment occurred over the course of 24 months, in which was divided into three separate time intervals: 14 to 61 days, 61 days to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months. Seedling survival in the field was high for all three time-intervals. Seed mass positively influenced the probability of seedling survival throughout all three time-intervals after planting, but the intensity of this effect decreased with time. Species with smaller seeds exhibited higher relative growth rates (height), but only until the end of the first year. Our results suggest that seed mass is a functional trait that can predict the probability of the establishment of individual trees during forest restoration.

M3  - Article
AB  - (The influence of forest litter on the endomicorritic fungi community in a natural regeneration area in Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Natural areas of high biological diversity are being degraded to meet man's need to convert them to various uses. The ecological restoration through litter transposition enables for the reestablishment of ecological processes and may contribute to the increase of microorganisms. It aimed to evaluate the influence of litter on the community of mycorrhizal fungi in an area of Cabreuva, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots were delimited, five control and five treatment. Soil samples were collected during two distinct periods for physical, chemical and microbiological analysis. Results indicated that the edaphic conditions of the place are consistent with the presence of AMF; also, the transposed organic matter did not increase species richness and did not facilitate the colonization of plant species, whereas gravimetric humidity and grass may have influenced species richness.

TI  - Ecological indicators of passive restoration in South Brazil's Atlantic Forest areas with former Pinus taeda L. plantations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural regeneration and the restoration course. However, most developed restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014) formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover, dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium of the NAtive Seed Science, TEchnology and Conservation (NAS-STEC)
CL  - Royal Botan Gardens, Kew, ENGLAND
AB  - Large-scale restoration programmes in the tropics require large volumes of high quality, genetically diverse and locally adapted seeds from a large number of species. However, scarcity of native seeds is a critical restriction to achieve restoration targets. In this paper, we analyse three successful community-based networks that supply native seeds and seedlings for Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado restoration projects. In addition, we propose directions to promote local participation, legal, technical and commercialisation issues for up-scaling the market of native seeds for restoration with high quality and social justice. We argue that effective community-based restoration arrangements should follow some principles: (i) seed production must be based on real market demand; (ii) non-governmental and governmental organisations have a key role in supporting local organisation, legal requirements and selling processes; (iii) local ecological knowledge and labour should be valued, enabling local communities to promote large-scale seed production; (iv) applied research can help develop appropriate techniques and solve technical issues. The case studies from Brazil and principles presented here can be useful for the up-scaling restoration ecology efforts in many other parts of the world and especially in tropical countries where improving rural community income is a strategy for biodiversity conservation and restoration.

TI  - RADIAL WOOD ALLOCATION IN SCHIZOLOBIUM PARAHYBA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Premise of the study: Pioneer species of tropical trees allocate wood specific gravity (SG) differently across the radius. Some species exhibit relatively uniform, low SG wood, whereas many others exhibit linear increases in SG across the radius. Here, we measured changes in SG across the radius of Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae), a wide-ranging, neotropical pioneer, used extensively in land reclamation and forest restoration in Brazil.Methods: Pith-to-bark radial wood cores were extracted with increment borers from 42 trees at five sites, in Central and South America. Cores were cut into 1-cm segments whose specific gravities were determined and analyzed via linear and nonlinear regression. Wood specific gravity, very low initially at 0.15-0.20, doubled or tripled across the tree radius to 0.45-0.65 for large adults.Key results: Unlike linear increases in other tropical pioneers, the increases in Schizolobium were nonlinear (convex up). At one site with even-aged trees, the magnitude of the radial increase was similar in all trees, despite a 4-fold difference in diameter among trees, implying that the radial increases in Schizolobium were regulated by tree age, not by tree size.Conclusions: This unique pattern of development should provide an extended period of growth when SG is low, facilitating hyper-extension of the bole, at some risk of structural failure. Later in growth, the SG rate of increase accelerates, reinforcing what was a precarious bole. Overall, these results suggest a third model for xylem allocation in tropical trees, a model that may be associated with monopodial stem development and limited life span.

TI  - A cost-efficient method to assess carbon stocks in tropical peat soil
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of belowground carbon stocks in tropical wetland forests requires funding for laboratory analyses and suitable facilities, which are often lacking in developing nations where most tropical wetlands are found. It is therefore beneficial to develop simple analytical tools to assist belowground carbon estimation where financial and technical limitations are common. Here we use published and original data to describe soil carbon density (kgC m(-3); C-d) as a function of bulk density (gC cm(-3); B-d), which can be used to rapidly estimate belowground carbon storage using B-d measurements only. Predicted carbon densities and stocks are compared with those obtained from direct carbon analysis for ten peat swamp forest stands in three national parks of Indonesia. Analysis of soil carbon density and bulk density from the literature indicated a strong linear relationship (C-d = B-d x 495.14+5.41, R-2 = 0.93, n = 151) for soils with organic C content > 40 %. As organic C content decreases, the relationship between C-d and B-d becomes less predictable as soil texture becomes an important determinant of C-d. The equation predicted belowground C stocks to within 0.92% to 9.57% of observed values. Average bulk density of collected peat samples was 0.127 g cm(-3), which is in the upper range of previous reports for Southeast Asian peatlands. When original data were included, the revised equation C-d = B-d x 468.76 + 5.82, with R-2 = 0.95 and n = 712, was slightly below the lower 95% confidence interval of the original equation, and tended to decrease C-d estimates. We recommend this last equation for a rapid estimation of soil C stocks for well-developed peat soils where C content > 40 %.

TI  - Monitoring ecological restoration of riparian forest: Is the applied nucleation effective ten years after implementation in the Pampa?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is a process that helps restore a degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystem. Applied nucleation is considered a strategy that facilitates the development of vegetation, attracts dispersers, and, over time, tends to expand, coalescing into continuous forests. However, simply implementing restorative techniques is not enough, it is also necessary to monitor the process. Monitoring requires good ecological indicators, which is a challenge for ecological restoration. The present study aims to evaluate, through ecological indicators, the effectiveness of the applied nucleation for restoration of riparian forest. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, Pampa region, southern Brazil. Ecological indicators were analyzed in two areas of restoration: passive and active restoration. In the area under active restoration, paired plots were evaluated: intra-nuclei (inside the nuclei) and inter-nuclei (outside the nuclei). To assess natural regeneration, all regenerant shrubby and arboreal individuals taller than 30 cm were counted and taxonomically identified. The species were classified according to the dispersal syndrome. Shannon diversity indices and Pielou evenness were calculated. The canopy cover of nuclei and trees planted crown cover were evaluated. Ecological indicators were compared using Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between passive, intra-nuclei, and inter-nuclei restorations for the evaluated indicators, with higher averages for intra-nuclei, followed by inter-nuclei and passive resto-rations. It is concluded that the intra-nuclei plots showed an increase in richness, abundance, biotic dispersal syndrome, canopy cover, and soil cover by plant litter and arboreal species. The applied nucleation is an effective strategy for ecological restoration in the study region.

TI  - Reference and comparison values for ecological indicators in assessing restoration areas in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on reference values is one of the great demands in ecological restoration, as they enable evaluating the restoration progress and taking adaptive management measures. Here we aimed to: (i) verify whether ecological indicators are influenced by the area of reference ecosystems (mature fragments); (ii) determine reference and comparison values for comparing the restoration progress; and (iii) check how long restoration forests take to reach naturalness values that are like the reference ecosystems (and can therefore be considered restored). We used the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as an object of study and compilated information about 967 secondary, mature and restoration forests in a wide geographical extension. In total, 14 ecological indicators were assessed in a sampling area of 1,928,024 m(2). We used simple linear regression to analyze the data and descriptive statistics for creating the reference and comparison values. We found that ecological indicators were not related to the area of mature fragments. Thus, they are useful for monitoring reference ecosystems of different sizes, and more attention can be given to the degree of conservation of the ecosystems. We defined intermediate and final reference values from secondary and mature forests, respectively. We also established comparison values for several restoration stages using data of planting, assisted and unassisted restoration areas. At the same time, we applied the concept of naturalness in restoration and obtained a continuum of naturalness, which was very useful for tracking the restoration progress. With the reference and comparison values determined, restoration practitioners can evaluate their restoration areas by comparing their monitoring results with ours. Moreover, by using the naturalness concept we verified that indicators can have different restoration trajectories. Some indicators reached similar naturalness levels as references from the beginning of restoration, but others required between one and two decades to recover. This study is the first to create evaluation criteria for forest restoration based on a large data set, and we hope that similar studies can be developed in other biomes.

TI  - Carbon balance of plywood from a social reforestation program in Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social reforestation programs plant trees on degraded, uncultivated land in low-income regions to allow the local population to generate income from selling wood products and-in case of agroforestry systems-to grow food. For fundraising it is of interest to demonstrate not only positive social impacts but also environmental ones. Proving negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would allow the programs to enter the market for carbon offsetting projects and liberate further funding. In a case study, a social reforestation program in Kalimantan, Indonesia, is analyzed. GHG emissions (according to ISO 14067, PAS 2050 and EU ILCD Handbook for LCA) of the main product, laminated veneer lumber plywood, are determined as 622 and 21 kg CO2-e/m(3) for short-term and long-term (above 100 years) plywood use, respectively. Switching to lignin-based resins and renewable electricity could reduce emissions down to - 363 kg CO2-e/m(3) for long-term use. The analyzed agroforestry system produces almost carbon-neutral plywood today and could be climate positive in the mid-term.

TI  - Hydrocarbon and elemental carbon signatures in a tropical wetland: Biogeochemical evidence of forest fire and vegetation changes
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence of changing vegetation in the tropical wetland (Rawa Danau, west Java, Indonesia) over the past 7428 years is illustrated by elemental (soot) carbon (EC) and n-alkane composition of sedimentary geolipids. In this study, vegetation changes and relevant controlling factors (e.g. forest fire and climate change) were documented on a decadal to centennial scale. The n-alkane composition that changes with depth might record changes in sources of organic matter (OM) in the wetland. The presence of EC (0.01-0.24% of organic carbon: OC) during late (0-1700 cal. year BP) and mid (3500-4500 cal. year BP) Holocene (at depths 0-50 cm, and 160-210 cm) indicated that large-scale forest fires severely affected the tropical vegetation. The hydrocarbon indices (CPI: carbon preference index, MCN: mean carbon number, and HVI: hydrocarbon vegetation index) significantly correlated with one another while a comparison of EC profile with the profiles of hydrocarbon indices indicated that n-alkane composition of the geolipid in lake sediment could record signatures of changes in catchment vegetation. Forest fire and vegetation changes might be related to regional climatic shifts relating to ENSO activity as well as being influenced by human influences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil macrofauna in areas with different successional vegetation stages after Eucalyptus grandis harvest in Brazil
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the composition of soil macrofauna over different periods after the harvest of Eucalyptus grandis to understand the ecological restoration process. Data collection was carried out in each climatic season by the "Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility" Program. In general, 25,789 individuals were collected from the soil macrofauna and distributed in 26 taxonomic groups, with the Formicidae family being the most abundant. Of the individuals found, 7,418 were collected during autumn, 7,320 in summer, 5,553 in winter, and 5,498 in spring. The soil macrofauna was influenced by seasonality, with a higher density of individuals in autumn and summer. Regarding functional groups, social groups were dominant in all areas and seasons, comprising 74.50% of the total number of individuals. The detritivores group comprised 17.98% of the total individuals. Herbivores, snails, and slugs accounted for 3.98% of the total individuals. The functional groups detritivores, herbivores, and predators were more abundant in the litter, while the social groups were predominant in the soil depths of 0 to 30 cm. As the forest progressed, the richness of the macrofauna groups increased, demonstrating the influence of successional dynamics on the composition of the soil macrofauna.

TI  - Less is more: Little seed processing required for direct seeding in seasonal tropics
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed processing and dormancy break treatments are recommended for rendering seeds restoration-ready. Conversely, fruit structures and seed coats may protect seeds from environmental harm in the field. We evaluated the effects of seed processing (by either keeping fruit structures or extracting seeds) and/or scarification (of physically dormant seeds) on the seedling emergence and establishment of 10 legume tree species from tropical forests and savannas of Central Brazil. We sowed seeds in a greenhouse for reference and in a field experiment conducted in tilled ready-to-seed sites. We monitored seedling emergence and survival for a year. We calculated the costs of harvesting, processing, and pretreating seeds, and considered the final cost of a 1-year-old seedling. Seed extraction resulted in lower emergence for most species in the greenhouse and in the field. It also accelerated emergence of three and four species in the greenhouse and the field, respectively. Scarification resulted in lower seedling emergence in the field for half of the species, while it increased emergence of three species in the greenhouse. Most species presented accelerated emergence both in the greenhouse and the field. The seedling cost was 1.6 to 74.6 times higher when seeds were processed, and 1.3 to 6.0 times when seeds were scarified, except for one species. Keeping fruit structures and seed coats reduced the costs of seeds and increased the success of direct seeding.

TI  - Wildlife Recovery During Tropical Forest Succession: Assessing Ecological Drivers of Community Change
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the high proportion of secondary forests in the tropics, their conservation value remains poorly understood, particularly with regard to animals. Most theoretical studies of succession have focused on plants, linking life history trade-offs to well-known patterns of community change. However, the same trade-offs proposed for plants should apply to animals, and indeed, animal studies show a change in community dominance from habitat generalist to forest specialist species during succession. Focusing on the diverse terrestrial small mammals of the endangered Atlantic Forest, we assessed which ecological drivers (habitat structure and food availability) affect community changes during succession. If the change in community dominance is driven by trade-offs between productivity and efficiency, it should be mainly associated with a decrease in food availability. As expected, from younger to older forest, habitat generalists decreased in richness and total abundance, concurrent with a decrease in arthropod biomass. By contrast, the increase in richness and total abundance of forest specialists was not clearly supported by the data; however, this group was not affected by food availability. These results are congruent with a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to use abundant resources, and indicate that the major community change during succession involves habitat generalists. Secondary forests may thus be valuable for conservation, at least where habitat loss and fragmentation are not high, and old growth forest is available.

TI  - Carbon stocks, emissions, and aboveground productivity in restored secondary tropical peat swamp forests
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetlands such as peat swamp forests (PSFs) have been known globally as one of the carbon (C)-rich ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of understanding on the C cycle in PSFs, especially in association with land use and cover changes (e.g., ecosystem degradation and restoration). This study presents the C stocks, removals, and emissions dataset, as well as the determining factors from an early restoration stage of secondary tropical PSFs in Central Kalimantan. We assessed various biophysical parameters such as forest structure, above- and belowground C-stocks, aboveground primary productivity, total and heterotrophic soil respirations, and groundwater level (GWL). We found that tree density varied from 1200 to 1825 trees per hectare (ha) across the plots, whereas the mean of stand basal area was 32.86 +/- 4.72m(2)ha(-1). Mean ecosystem C stocks in the study site was 1752 +/- 401Mg-Cha(-1), of which 93% was stored in belowground organic peat soils. A mean aboveground litterfall production of 4.6 +/- 0.5Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) and biomass C sequestration through tree diameter increment with 2.7 +/- 0.5Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) was obtained. We observed slightly larger portion of annual mean total soil respiration with 14.2 +/- 1.1Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1) than heterotrophic respiration 11.1 +/- 0.9Mg-Cha(-1)year(-1), emphasizing the lower contribution of autotrophic respiration from the belowground rooting system. Findings imply that further conservation management efforts through ecosystem restoration may preserve C stored and enhance C input in PSFs substantially, and could be potentially included in national climate change mitigation strategies.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the development of shrub live cuttings and their effect on slope stability. Vertical in situ pullout tests and measurements of Phyllanthus sellowianus shoots and roots of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 months old were conducted. Stability analyses were conducted for slopes with planar and curved rupture surfaces and for soils with and without plants. The results showed that seasons affected plants growth and their ability to provide soil strength. Soil shear strength values ranged from 4.5 kPa (2 months old) to 47.6 kPa (14 months old). The critical factors of safety (FS) for slopes for both planar and curved rupture surfaces were found in the absence of plants and reached the stability condition (FS>2) with plants at 4 (planar) and 6 (curved) months old.

TI  - Deforestation and forest fires transforming the reality of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve (RECM) is a sustainable use conservation unit that covers almost one million hectares, located in the state of Acre, in Brazil's southwestern Amazon. Withten thousand in habitants estimated, it is a concrete example of the legacy of Chico Mendes and an emblematic one of the challenges faced by conservation units in the Amazon. Significant changes occurred since the reserve was created in 1990 in relation to deforestation and forest degradation. About 5.6% of the RECM, 54,741ha, was deforested between 1997 and 2016, according to Prodes / Inpe data. A comparison of deforestation rates recorded by Prodes and the Global Forest Change Project (GFC) showed deceptively similar results for the period 2000 to 2016: 31,485ha and 34,102ha, respectively. Only during the period 2007 to 2011, the two monitoring systems gave similar results. From 2012 to 2016, the GFC recorded annual rates about 75% higher than the annual Prodes rates. The average size of polygons per year increased 3x in the last 10 years, from 3 ha/year (2001 to 2006) to 8 ha/year (2007 to 2016), with 92% expansion of existing deforestation. The spatial distribution of deforestation was concentrated in ten of the 46 RECM rubber plantations, some of which recorded more than 50% deforestation by 2016, according to Prodes. Forest fires have been a major concern for the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, due to the impact of 50,363ha of forests degraded by fire, an area equal to total deforestation. This degradation affects carbon stocks and damages the species used for extractivism. Scars from contiguous forest fires > 1,000ha formed more than half of the total burned area and occurred in sparsely populated areas of RECM. Severe droughts appear to be fundamental for the propagation of forest fires that originated in cleaning and tillage fires for pasture and/or agriculture of less than 30ha, providing a new paradigm of forest degradation by fire. With the increase in the average size of deforestation polygons, the RECM faces a situation that goes against the legacy of Chico Mendes: an expansion of deforestation for pastures and fire degradation of the forests that form the base of extractivism.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of natural regeneration can provide information on potential species for use in ecological restoration projects, as well as provide indications of the area resilience after degradation. In order to analyze variations of natural regeneration in two successional stages and to subsidize the indication of species for planting and enrichness, two abandoned pastures were sampled in Serra do Itajai National Park (PNSI), Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil. In the analysis of the main components, the plots differed according to the change in the quantitative variables of the species (Monte Carlo, P <= 0.05), and two groups were segregated: the first one constituted by the vegetation in the initial stage, and the second one, by intermediate stage vegetation. Twenty-one species were sampled and the intermediate stage showed the greatest richness (n = 19). The pioneer species were predominant in both stages, especially Vernonanthura discolor, Piptocarpha regnellii and Myrsine coriacea. The results demonstrate that the initial stage does not have indicator species, because all species occur frequently in the intermediate stage. However, the intermediate stage was distinguished by the presence of eight indicator species, which are potentially recommended for reforestation and enrichment plantations of Montana Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the PNSI.

TI  - Establishment of Native Species Through Direct Seeding in Piauitinga River - Sergipe
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The direct seeding technique stands out for forest restoration projects due to savings in deployment costs and has been increasingly used. This work was carried out with the objective of assessing emergence, survival and establishment of native forest species, by means of seeds, in riparian areas of Piauitinga River, in the municipality of Lagarto-SE. The species used were Libidibia ferrea var. leiostachya (Benth.) L.P. Queiroz., Cassia grandis L.F., Cecropia pachystachya Trec., Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong and Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. The field work was performed in a randomized block design (RBD) with four replications in factorial scheme, testing five species with and without treatment for overcoming of dormancy. It was observed that direct sowing is a viable technique for the area of study only for the species L. ferrea var. leiostachya, E. contortisiliquum and Cassia grandis, using seeds with and without dormancy.

TI  - AN ATTEMPT TO PREDICT WHICH AMAZONIAN TREE SPECIES MAY BE THREATENED BY LOGGING ACTIVITIES
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of logging on Amazonian ecosystems has been the focus of considerable attention both within and outside of Amazonia. However, the impacts of logging on individual timber species has not been at all adequately investigated. Logging affects timber species by: (1) removing mature individuals that are important sources of seeds; (2) damaging seedlings and saplings (i.e future generations of canopy adults); and (3) creating conditions that favour fire by opening the canopy and leaving slash as fuel on the forest floor.In this study we summarize information on the ecological characteristics of 305 timber species in Brazilian Amazonia. We identify seven ecological parameters that are useful in evaluating a species ability to resist the negative impacts of logging. These characteristics are: (1) effective long-distance dispersal ability; (2) abundance of saplings in forest regeneration; (3) rapid growth; (4) ability to resprout; (5) capacity to withstand fire; (6) broad geographic distribution; and (7) high density of adults. We hypothesize that species with characteristics opposed to these parameters and subjected to intense logging pressure will have difficulty in maintaining their populations in logging reg ions.We use a simple scoring system to rank species with regard to their hypothesized ability to withstand logging impacts. Among the species that are potentially susceptible to logging impacts are euxylophora paraensis (Pau Amarelo) and Swietenia macrophylla (American Mahogany). The sawn lumber from these two species goes principally to European and North American buyers, revealing a direct link between First World consumption and possible biodiversity impoverishment in the Brazilian rain-forest. These two species, and others that might experience population reductions as a result of logging, merit special study.

TI  - Germination, viability and dormancy of 47 species from threatened tropical montane grassland in southeast Brazil: Implications for ex situ conservation
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate anthropogenic impacts on plant diversity in tropical montane grasslands, one of the most threatened ecosystems in Brazil, it will be essential to develop ex situ conservation strategies to preserve wild species. The lack of basic research on the seed storage behaviour of grassland species may, however, limit their use for reintroduction and restoration projects.We investigated seed storage behaviour at the community level by comparing the effects of cold-low RH (10 degrees C; 10% RH) and freezing-low RH (20 degrees C; 10% RH) conditions on seed viability, germination and dormancy of 47 species.Fresh seeds of 43% of the species showed primary dormancy. More than half of the species showed high seed survival responses (viability >60%) under both storage temperatures. Despite a variety of dormancy responses among the different species, the low RH storage conditions tested released dormancy for most species during 12- and 30-month storage times. Multivariate analysis of the best (freezing-low RH, 30 months) storage condition evidenced the formation of five distinct groups, three with species having high conservation potential in seed banks.Although further studies are needed to test dormancy-breaking treatments and improve seed conservation practices, this first approach to assessing seed banking techniques could contribute to demand for locally adapted seeds for ecological restoration projects in tropical montane grasslands.

TI  - Growth seedlings of Poincianella pluviosa (DC.) LPQueiroz in different substrates and irrigation blades
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, Brazil has a demand for 21 million hectares of forest restoration, and consequently, a great demand for good quality native species seedlings. It is important to employ techniques that reduce the costs of productive inputs as substrates and the irrigation water. In this context, the paper aimed to evaluate the growth of Poincianella pluviosa (DC.) L.P.Queiroz seedlings produced in four substrates elaborated with different solid wastes (sewage sludge, composted sawdust, and charcoal powder) and under two irrigation depths (0,03 L/h and 0,05 L/h). The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design with a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement (four substrates and two irrigation depths), eight treatments in total. The physical (porosity, density etc) and chemical (nutrients and organic matter contents) properties of substrates were evaluated. The seedlings shoot height, collar diameter, shoot, root, and total dry mass were measured. The substrates S1- pure sewage sludge and S2- sludge + sawdust (1:1) presented the better physical characteristics and substrates S1- pure sewage sludge and S3- sludge + charcoal powder (1:1) showed the better nutritional composition. For the growth in height there were no difference between the substrates and the irrigation depths. The substrates formulated with 50% of sludge and 50% of sawdust or charcoal powder, combined with the higher irrigation depth, resulted in seedlings with higher collar diameter, biomass, and quality, for which they are recommended to produce P. pluviosa.

TI  - WEIGHTED LINEAR COMBINATIONOF A GIS ENVIRONMENT IN THE DEFINITION OF PRIORITY AREAS FOR CONNECTIVITY AMONG FOREST FRAGMENTS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

TI  - Soil dynamics and carbon stocks 10 years after restoration of degraded land using Atlantic Forest tree species
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Atlantic Forest ecosystem has been greatly affected by land use changes, with only 11.26% of its original vegetation cover remaining. Currently, Atlantic Forest restoration is receiving increasing attention because of its potential for carbon sequestration and the important role of soil carbon in the global carbon balance. Soil organic matter is also essential for physical, chemical and biological components of soil fertility and forest sustainability. This study evaluated the potential for soil recovery in contrasting restoration models using indigenous Atlantic Forest tree species ten years after their establishment. The study site is located in Botucatu municipality, Sao Paulo State-Brazil, in a loamy dystrophic Red-Yellow Argisol site (Typic Hapludult). Four treatments were compared: i) Control (Spontaneous Restoration); ii) Low Diversity (five fast-growing tree species established by direct seeding); iii) High Diversity (mixed plantings of 41 species established with seedlings) and; iv) Native Forest (well conserved neighboring forest fragment). The following soil properties were evaluated: (1) physical- texture, density and porosity; (2) chemical-C, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, Al and pH; (3) biological-microbial biomass. Litter nutrient concentrations (P, S, K, Ca and Mg) and C and N litter stocks were determined. Within ten years the litter C and N stocks of the Low Diversity treatment area were higher than Control and similar to those in both the High Diversity treatment and the Native Forest. Soil C stocks increased through time for both models and in the Control plots, but remained highest in the Native Forest. The methods of restoration were shown to have different effects on soil dynamics, mainly on chemical properties. These results show that, at least in the short-term, changes in soil properties are more rapid in a less complex system like the Low Diversity model than in the a High Species Diversity model. For both mixed plantation systems, carbon soil cycling can be reestablished, resulting in increases in carbon stocks in both soil and litter.

TI  - Effects of topographic variability and forest attributes on fine-scale soil fertility in late-secondary succession of Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding how soil fertility changes due to topographical conditions and forest attributes is an essential premise for local-scale forest management practices. We evaluated the effects of topographic variables and forest attributes on soil fertility along a local topographical gradient in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We hypothesised that soil fertility is positively affected by topographic variability and forest attributes (structure and diversity). We used tree species richness, composition, abundance, and aboveground biomass as forest attributes. We analysed two 1-ha forest patches with contrasting topographical conditions. We used different linear mixed effects models (LMMs) to test the main effects of different forest attributes and topography variables on soil fertility. Results The results showed that higher topographic variability determines soil fertility along a fine-scale gradient. The first two axes of the PCA explained 66.8% of the variation in soil data, with the first axis (PCA(1)) explaining 49.6% of the variation in soil data and positively correlating with fertility-related soil properties. The second axis (PCA(2)) explained 17.2% of the variation in topographical data and positively correlated with convexity (the elevation of a plot minus the average elevation of all immediate neighbour plots) and elevation. Our best models showed that topographic variables (elevation and convexity) are the main predictors that affect fine-scale soil fertility. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the topographic variability, mainly elevation and convexity, determines fine-scale soil fertility in an Atlantic Forest. These results advance our understanding that context-dependent conditions based on topography and soil properties have a high variability at a fine scale, which can influence variations in forest attributes (i.e., species distribution, diversity and structure of tree communities). In addition, the information generated in this research may be important for planning forest restoration activities (passive and active) based on the high variability of environmental variables at a fine scale.

TI  - Playback point counts and N-mixture models suggest higher than expected abundance of the critically endangered blond titi monkey in northeastern Brazil
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of threatened species requires accurate population size estimation and monitoring. However, reliable population size estimates are lacking for many endangered species. The critically endangered blond titi monkey (Callicebus barbarabrownae) is an endemic primate of the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. A previous assessment based on presence-only data estimated a minimum population size of 260 mature individuals in 2,636 km(2), and studies based on visual records suggested very low local relative abundance. However, this cryptic species is known to be difficult to visually detect. We played back recordings of C. barbarabrownae loud calls to count the number of responding groups in 34 sampling sites during 9 consecutive days in a 221-km(2) study area. Repeated group counts at sites were used in N-mixture models, which account for imperfect detection, to estimate the number of groups in relation to dry forest area and distance to villages. We estimated a total of 91 groups in the study area. Considering the mean number of adults per group as three, we estimated a population of 273 adult individuals, resulting in a density of 2.3 individuals/km(2) in the dry forest habitat. Detection probability was four times higher for surveys conducted between sunrise to midmorning than between midmorning to sunset. We also found that C. barbarabrownae abundance increases with increasing dry forest area and increasing distance to the nearest village, indicating the need to promote dry forest restoration in the Caatinga. As our results suggest a larger population of C. barbarabrownae than had been previously estimated for its entire distribution, our results suggest a need for similar assessments in other areas to reliably estimate the total population size. This study demonstrates how playback surveys coupled with N-mixture models can be used to estimate population sizes of acoustically-responsive primates, and thus contribute to more effective conservation management.

TI  - Intensive silvicultural practices enhance the performance of forest species in restoration plantations
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing native forest tree species in degraded areas is a considerable challenge for forestry. Adverse ecological filters can compromise the sustainability of ecosystems undergoing restoration. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the effects of three silvicultural practices on the allocation of aboveground biomass, nutrient content, and control of invasive plants in a mixed plantation of native forest species in the extreme south of the Atlantic Forest Biome. The experiment was conducted in an area belonging to the Quarta Col & ocirc;nia State Park. It was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of three silvicultural practices (intensive silviculture, conventional silviculture, and low-input silviculture). At 36 months after planting, assessments of the biomass allocation of tree species, weed biomass, and nutrient content in the leaf tissue were conducted. The greater input of nutrients and the use of glyphosate to control weeds in the initial periods after planting led to higher biomass values for all the species studied. However, the use of silvicultural practices with low intervention levels has increased the number of invasive plants. We also verified that native forest species had higher levels of nutrients, that is, mainly N and K, in plots managed with intensive silviculture compared with other silvicultural practices.

TI  - The structure of bird communities in areas revegetated after mining in southern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mined areas undergo physical changes and profound alterations in the structure and composition of the vegetation. Hence, the fauna cannot return to these areas without human intervention, usually through revegetation. In the state of Parana, southern Brazil, we assessed the structure of bird communities (species richness, composition, trophic guilds, and forest dependence) in areas of different ages (5, 10, and 20 years) that were revegetated after mining with a single species of native tree (Mimosa scabrella). These areas were compared with a forest area with no mining influence (control). The areas differed in species richness and species composition. Birds of some foraging guilds (e. g., frugivores) were absent from 10- and 5-year-old areas. The occurrence of forest-dependent birds increased, whereas forest-independent birds decreased with increasing area age. The death of Mimosa scabrella trees between 10 and 20 years after planting reduced vegetation complexity and affected the bird fauna. To avoid such an effect, and to assure the presence of frugivorous birds that are important to restore the vegetation through seed dispersal, we recommend the use of a high diversity of plant species in the initial planting, including plants with fleshy fruits that attract frugivorous birds.

TI  - IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT RESTORATION PROGRAM IN PROTECTION FOREST
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A restoration program is needed by West Lampung District, because 80% of the protected forests in this district have been damaged. Bina Wana (BW) Community Forest Group (CFG) has been successful in carrying out restoration program of 465 ha of Bukit Rigis protected forest. It resulted in an 80% increase in its members' income and an increase by 2.58% of the forest cover. To maintain the success of a sustainable restoration program, high commitment from the community is needed. This research has been conducted in June July2019 at West Lampung District, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The objective of this research is to analyse the social variables that affect restoration in the protection forest. The dependent variable is income and independent variables consist of respondents' characteristics as individuals and social characteristics of the community. Based on the multiple regression linear analysis from 75 respondents, it was found that the significant variables for the sustainability of the restoration of Bukit Rigis protected forest are as follow: age, sex, education, status in CFG, distance from home to CF areas, social aids and social capital (networks, norms and trust). Existence of the youth groups namely Himpunan Pemuda Peduk Hutan dan Lingkungan (HPPHL) and Melati Women Forest Farmer Group (WFFG) plays an important role in implementing the restoration program. Establishment of HPPHL will ensure regeneration in maintaining the sustainability of restoration achievements. The role of WFFG is also important because their households' income is supported by WFFG and enables the BW CFG members to be more concentrated in maintaining forest sustainability.

TI  - Review of the science and practice of restoration in Argentina: increasing awareness of the discipline
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of this work was to obtain an overview of studies on ecological restoration carried out in Argentina to date. By means of the Scopus database, we performed two literature searches, one in Spanish (restau* and Argentina) and the other in English (restor* and Argentina). Between 1996 and 2013, 105 publications were registered, representing 2% of publications in Biology and Ecology. Most of these appeared in international journals (87%), in English (86%), and 28% were coauthored with researchers from other countries, favoring visibility at an international level. We observed an increase in the number of studies per year over time, with a significant increase beginning in 2008. Of the 18 ecological regions in Argentina, we found studies relating to 12 as well as four studies relating to restoration in urban areas. This review of the literature is intended to increase awareness of restoration in Argentina and help identify current gaps relating either to this subject or to specific ecological regions.

TI  - Integrating species and successional classes for wood production in a mixed forest restoration system in a neotropical region
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As forests in neotropical regions, particularly in developing countries, are devastated, interventions to restore biodiversity and its ecological functions are needed. Rural producers have thus been encouraged to grow trees for wood production as an economic activity. The objective of this study was to quantify the increment of wood density of four forest species from different successional classes of a mixed system of restoration in a neotropical forest in Brazil. Tree discs were sampled at breast height and analyzed radially by X-ray densitometry to obtain apparent density and basic density. Three trees each of a species from the pioneer, early and late secondary successional stages and of the dominant species in the climax community. The radial profiles indicated increasing density from the pith to bark of trunks, except for some variations due to wood defects and growth. Average density was 0.576 g cm(-3), 0.655 g cm(-3), 0.706 g cm(-3) and 0.775 g cm(-3), respectively, for Peltophorum dubium, Schinus terebinthifolius, Cariniana estrellensis and Hymenaea courbaril. Radial profiles indicated higher amplitudes in the apparent densities for slow-growing species. X-ray densitometry generated parameters such as minimum, average and maximum densities, and radial density variations. These parameters are important for understanding the ecological functional role of successional classes of the Atlantic Forest from the Neotropical region.

TI  - Bird Extinctions in Brazil's Atlantic Forest and How They Can Be Prevented
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird species extinctions in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil have been predicted since the early 1990s, but it has become accepted wisdom that none have yet been documented. We revisit this question in light of updates to the global Red List, and conclude that between five and seven bird species have likely been driven to extinction in the wild in this biome in recent decades, plus a further two species that occurred elsewhere in Brazil. These extinctions were the result of habitat loss in combination with other threats. A further nine Atlantic Forest bird species are Critically Endangered, plus six from elsewhere in Brazil. We review growing efforts to help these species avoid extinction using a range of tools including multi-stakeholder planning, advocacy, habitat protection and restoration on public and private land, focussed research, and intensive population management, drawing on examples from the most threatened Atlantic Forest endemics. Conservation organisations, local communities, government agencies, zoos, international funders, universities and others are working together to prevent these species from disappearing. While the political environment in Brazil has rarely been more hostile to conservation, there are also some positive trends. Rates of deforestation in the Atlantic Forest have fallen, forest restoration and recovery is increasing, and an unprecedented number of ordinary people are taking an interest in birds and participating in citizen science. With dedication, collaboration, sufficient resources, and a focus on evidence-informed solutions, we are hopeful that many of the Critically Endangered species can be pulled back from the brink of extinction.

TI  - Genomic diversity is similar between Atlantic Forest restorations and natural remnants for the native tree Casearia sylvestris Sw.
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary focus of tropical forest restoration has been the recovery of forest structure and tree taxonomic diversity, with limited attention given to genetic conservation. Populations reintroduced through restoration plantings may have low genetic diversity and be genetically structured due to founder effects and genetic drift, which limit the potential of restoration to recover ecologically resilient plant communities. Here, we studied the genetic diversity, genetic structure and differentiation using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers between restored and natural populations of the native tree Casearia sylvestris in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We sampled leaves from approximately 24 adult individuals in each of the study sites: two restoration plantations (27 and 62 years old) and two forest remnants. We prepared and sequenced a genotyping-by-sequencing library, SNP markers were identified de novo using Stacks pipeline, and genetic parameters and structure analyses were then estimated for populations. The sequencing step was successful for 80 sampled individuals. Neutral genetic diversity was similar among restored and natural populations (A(R) = 1.72 +/- 0.005; H-O = 0.135 +/- 0.005; H-E = 0.167 +/- 0.005; F-IS = 0.16 +/- 0.022), which were not genetically structured by population subdivision. In spite of this absence of genetic structure by population we found genetic structure within populations but even so there is not spatial genetic structure in any population studied. Less than 1% of the neutral alleles were exclusive to a population. In general, contrary to our expectations, restoration plantations were then effective for conserving tree genetic diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that genotyping-by-sequencing can be a useful tool in restoration genetics.

TI  - Linking above and belowground carbon sequestration, soil organic matter properties, and soil health in Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting ('active restoration'): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using & delta;13C and & delta;15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha-1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha-1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had & delta;13C and & delta;15N values of 2.1 and 1.7 & PTSTHOUSND;, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 & mu;g m-2 h-1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage.

TI  - SPECIES-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION IN THE INTERIOR AND ON THE EDGE OF A SEMI-DECIDUOUS SEASONAL FOREST FRAGMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at analysing the distribution of 40 tree species with the highest absolute density within a semi-deciduous seasonal forest fragment located in the municipality of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espirito Santo, Brazil. There were 39 plots allocated for the study, consisting of 27 on the edge and 12 inside the fragment. The environmental variables used were: aluminium saturation, base saturation, soil moisture, leaf area index (LAI) and average slope. Canonical correspondence analysis using the CANOCO 2.1 program was applied to analyse the species-environment interactions on the edge and inside the fragment. Although the most striking heterogeneity in the fragment was related to the LAI and the land slope, the species showed the highest correlation with the soil characteristics (base saturation and aluminium saturation), suggesting that these species have generalist behaviour in relation to the availability of solar radiation in the environment and seek to establish their niche in the soil gradient. The results are helpful in increasing our understanding about the interactions between the species and the environmental variables involved in the study, enabling a more effective indication of them in forest restoration projects.

TI  - Natural regeneration of tree species in the understory of Corymbia citriodora in Florestal city, Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BRASILIENSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural regeneration of tree species in forested areas has been studied by several researches. This study aimed to evaluate the natural regeneration of tree species in Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) K. D. Hill & L. A. Johnson planted forest understory in Florestal, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were evaluated in seven 25 x 4 m plots randomly distributed. A phytosociological survey was carried out and the ecological groups and the dispersal syndromes of the regenerants were determined. We found 28 species belonging to 12 families, among which Fabacea and Annonaceae stood out. Density was 1,557 regenerants ha(-1), and basal area was 23 m(2) ha(-1). The most important species were Psidium sp; Schefflera macrocarpa (Cham & Schltdl.) Frodin; Pera glabrata (Schott) Poepp. ex Baill.; Astronium fraxinifolium Schott & Spreng.; Matayba guianensis Aubl.; and Plathymenia reticulata Benth. We found 35% pioneer, 40% early secondary, 18% late secondary, and 7% climax species, of which 57% are zoochoric, 40% anemochoric, and 3% autochoric. It is concluded that the natural regeneration in the understory studied comprises typical species of the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest of the Atlantic Forest biome, presenting significant density and individuals from all ecological groups.

TI  - Small mammals in a mosaic of forest remnants and anthropogenic habitats-evaluating matrix quality in an Atlantic forest landscape
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The matrix of altered habitats that surrounds remnants in human dominated landscapes has been considered homogeneous and inhospitable. Recent studies, however, have shown the crucial role of the matrix in maintaining diversity in fragmented landscapes, acting as a mosaic of units with varying permeability to different species. Inclusion of matrix quality parameters is especially urgent in managing fragmented landscapes in the tropics where agriculture frontiers are still expanding. Using standardized surveys in 23 sites in an Atlantic forest landscape, we evaluated matrix use by small mammals, the most diverse ecological group of mammals in the Neotropics, and tested the hypothesis that endemic species are the most affected by the conversion of original forest into anthropogenic habitats. By comparing species distribution among forest remnants and the predominant adjacent habitats (native vegetation in initial stages of regeneration, eucalyptus plantations, areas of agriculture and rural areas with buildings), we found a strong dissimilarity in small mammal assemblages between native vegetation (including initial stages) and anthropogenic habitats, with only two species being able to use all habitats. Endemic small mammals tended to occupy native vegetation, whereas invading species from other countries or open biomes tended to occupy areas of non-native vegetation. Our results highlight that future destruction of native vegetation will favor invading or generalist species which could dominate highly disturbed landscapes, and that some matrix habitats, such as regenerating native vegetation, should be managed to increase connectivity among populations of endemic species.

TI  - COMPARING NUCLEATION TECHNIQUES USED FOR THE RESTORATION OF DEGRADED AREAS IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil exploration in the Amazon generally results in the creation of clearings. The traditional planting of tree seedlings in these remote degraded areas uses air and river transport of machinery and supplies resulting in a very expensive restoration process. To develop low cost nucleation techniques based on the application of locally available natural elements, allowing the natural regeneration of pioneer tree species, 5 treatments with 5 replicates, distributed in a 25 x 25 m Latin square, were tested, in the region of Urucu, Amazonas: T0 (control), T1 (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds of manually scarified soil with sides protected using Cecropia logs), T2 (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds without lateral protection), T3 (application of topsoil directly on the fertilized surface of the degraded area) and T4 (application of topsoil by hydroseeding on seedbed). The effects on apparent density and soil fertility, as well as on the density and growth of emerged seedlings, were evaluated. After 18 months, the T1, T2 and T3 treatments resulted in the establishment of 3, 1 and 1 individuals m(-2), respectively, with similar heights, originating from the topsoil. The T0 and T4 treatments had no seedling emergence. The soil density was higher in treatments (>1.3 g cm(-3)) compared to the forest (0.95 cm(-3)). While the application of fertilizer and limestone promoted an increase in the soil fertility in the treatments, the levels of nitrogen and organic matter were higher in the forest.

TI  - Epiphytic orchid diversity in Schima wallichii trees in a forest region of Mt. Sanggara, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - III INTERNATIONAL ORCHID SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Orchid Symposium
CL  - Seoul, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Schima wallichii is a forest tree species that grows in critical land areas and is widely used for forest restoration. To clarify the relation between epiphytic orchid diversity and S. wallichii host populations, 40 S. wallichii trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 20 cm were randomly chosen and the attached epiphytic orchids identified in a forest region of Mt. Sanggara, West Java Province, Indonesia. The diameter and height of each host tree were measured. The growing positions of epiphytic orchids on each host tree were grouped using Johansson's method into five different zones based on tree architecture. A total of 39 epiphytic orchid species were identified from whole host trees. The most abundant species were Coelogyne miniata, followed by Bulbophyllum flavescens and Eria multiflora. The mid-canopy (Johansson zone 4) of the host with a suitable number and size of branches was the most abundant zone for epiphytic orchids. The diversity of epiphytic orchids grown on S. wallichii trees was categorised as medium (H'=2.69). The DBH of S. wallichii showed a positive effect on epiphytic orchid abundance (p<0.01), species richness (p<0.05), and diversity (p<0.05). Conservation of S. wallichii will lead to the sustainability of the number, species richness, and diversity of epiphytic orchids in the mountainous forest regions of West Java.

TI  - Direct sowing for the implantation of a riparian forest at the lower San Francisco River in Sergipe State, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was undertaken with the goal to evaluate the initial growth of five forest species, after direct sowing in a riparian area at the lower San Francisco River, Sergipe. The experiment was carried out in Santana San Francisco County, SE (10 degrees 18 '' 56' S e 36 degrees 52 '' 58' W), in a randomized block design, with line plantings, alternating pioneer and climax species. The evaluated parameters were: seedlings' emergence, survival and initial growth by height, base diameter and relative growth. Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Hymenaea courbaril and Cassia grandis showed the best percentages of seedling emergence, while Schinus terebinthifolius and Caesalpinia leiostachya were in the lower percentages. Seedling establishment was affected by specific mass and length of seeds. E. contortisiliquum and H. courbaril were superior to other species in survival at 30 months. C. leiostachya and E. contortisiliquum presented the best growth in height, while S. terebinthifolius had the largest base diameter. S. terebinthifolius had the best relative growth in height and base diameter. The studied species showed potential for the use in the restoration of riparian forests by direct sowing.

TI  - Is Direct Seeding a Biologically Viable Strategy for Restoring Forest Ecosystems? Evidences from a Meta-analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has become an important technique for mitigating the human impacts on natural vegetation. Planting seedlings is the most common approach to regain lost forest cover. However, these activities require a large economic investment. Direct seeding is considered a cheaper and easier alternative technique, in which tree seeds are introduced directly on the site rather than transplanting seedlings from nurseries. To evaluate the effectiveness of direct seeding, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature using restoration', direct seeding' and sowing' as keywords, and we performed a meta-analysis using 30 papers and 89 species. We used two different measures of restoration success: seed germination probability and success probability (the chance that a seed germinates and survives until the end of the experiment). In general, restoration attempts using direct-seeding techniques were relatively unsuccessful. On average, seed germination and success probability were 0239 and 0114, respectively, and were not affected by climate, species successional group or the application of pre-germinative treatments. Germination and success probability increased with seed size, and the use of physical protections resulted in a nearly twofold increase in germination probability, but this effect faded by the end of the experiments. Because of the low rate of seedling success, we suggest the use of direct seeding as a complementary technique to reduce restoration costs, particularly for species with large seeds and known high germination rates, but our results do not support direct seeding as a substitute for seedling planting.

TI  - Protected area types, strategies and impacts in Brazil's Amazon: public protected area strategies do not yield a consistent ranking of protected area types by impact
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The leading policy to conserve forest is protected areas (PAs). Yet, PAs are not a single tool: land users and uses vary by PA type; and public PA strategies vary in the extent of each type and in the determinants of impact for each type, i.e. siting and internal deforestation. Further, across regions and time, strategies respond to pressures (deforestation and political). We estimate deforestation impacts of PA types for a critical frontier, the Brazilian Amazon. We separate regions and time periods that differ in their deforestation and political pressures and document considerable variation in PA strategies across regions, time periods and types. The siting of PAs varies across regions. For example, all else being equal, PAs in the arc of deforestation are relatively far from non-forest, while in other states they are relatively near. Internal deforestation varies across time periods, e.g. it is more similar across the PA types for PAs after 2000. By contrast, after 2000, PA extent is less similar across PA types with little non-indigenous area created inside the arc. PA strategies generate a range of impacts for PA types-always far higher within the arc-but not a consistent ranking of PA types by impact.

TI  - Effects of the control of an invasive tree on the structure of a plant-frugivore network.
T2  - Ecological Applications
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive non-native species are one of the main causes of degradation of ecosystems worldwide. The control of invasive species is key to reducing threats to ecosystem viability in the long term. Observations of structural changes in ecological interaction networks following invasive species suppression can be useful to monitor the success of ecological restoration initiatives. We evaluated the structure of plant-bird frugivory interaction networks in a plant community invaded by the guava tree (Psidium guajava L.) by comparing network metrics before and after control actions. Psidium guajava was relevant in all metrics for the unmanaged network in this study, with high degree centrality and high nestedness contribution. Based on the asymmetry of species interactions, we found that birds were highly dependent on the invasive plant before suppression. Once P. guajava trees were eliminated, bird and plant species richness, total number of interactions, and modularity increased, whereas nestedness and interaction strength asymmetry decreased. The diet of the bird community became more diversified once P. guajava was no longer available and relevant species roles in community structure emerged. Our results corroborate the fact that ecological restoration interventions should include the control of non-native plant species that attract frugivorous animals in order to diversify plant-frugivore interactions and thus maintain biodiversity in natural ecosystems.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION STRATUM AS AN INDICATOR OF RESTORATION IN AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPENSATION FOR MINING LIMESTONE, MUNICIPALITY OF BARROSO, MG, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in a forest under restoration process, which belongs to the company Holcim Brasil S/A, in the municipality of Barroso, state of Minas Gerais (21 degrees 00' to 22 degrees 00'S and 43 degrees 00' to 44 degrees 00'W), where 40 plots (2 x 2 m) were set, spaced at 10 m, forming eight strata parallel to the watercourse present in the area. Floristic composition and natural regeneration stratum were characterized, and the formed strata allowed evaluating whether the riparian vegetation and watercourse influence on the local regeneration. It was found 162 individuals of 13 families, 18 genera and 22 species, and 10,125 individuals/ha were estimated. Successional classes from pioneer and early secondary and zoochory dispersion syndrome prevailed among species and individuals. The watercourse and riparian vegetation did not exercise significant influence (p>0.05) on the number of species and regenerating individuals among the different strata of the forest. The diversity index of Shannon-Wiener (H') and equability of Pielou (J') were 2.691 and 0.870, respectively. The species Psidium guajava and Myrtaceae families presented the highest VI (value of importance). Natural regeneration analysis showed the low floristic diversity in the area, suggesting that corrective management actions should be adopted.

TI  - Genomic population structure of Parkia platycephala Benth. (Leguminosae) from Northeastern Brazil
T2  - GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Parkia platycephala Benth. is a native species with high nutritional and ecological potential that is used in forest recovery and restoration. However, studies on the diversity and population genetic structure of this species are limited. Therefore, 5036 nucleotide polymorphism loci (resulting from genotyping by sequencing) were used to investigate the diversity and population structure of P. platycephala in two localities of Northeast Brazil. One of the evaluated areas comprised the Conservation Unit, Sete Cidades National Park, the other location consisted of the trees located around the park. A high level of genetic diversity was found for both populations, with similar values of expected heterozygosity (H-E = 0.29), showing the existence of a considerable level of genetic variation. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the diversity (99.06%) was distributed within populations. The results of the genetic structuring indicated little divergence between the plants, suggesting that the evaluated groups could be considered a single population. Few loci under selection (outliers) were identified; thus, no significant evidence of adaptive divergence was found. The results indicate that P. platycephala trees inside and outside the Conservation Unit maintain high genetic diversity, which has potential for use in breeding programs and for the production of seedlings for forest restoration. Furthermore, the importance of the Sete Cidades National Park for in situ conservation of this species is highlighted.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to analyse the co-benefits of reforestation projects developed in the voluntary carbon market based on the analysis of a single case study: the Ecological Corridor Project Monte Pascoal-Pau Brazil, the first forest restoration project in Latin America to receive the seal climate community and biodiversity (CCB). To achieve this purpose, the research combined: i) primary sources, obtained from visits and interviews with key actors and script for semi-structured, with; ii) secondary sources, including reports of institutions on this theme and references. The results presented showed that forestry projects have positive co-benefits beyond those achieved in reducing deforestation and carbon sequestration, whether in environmental and social benefits. The case study had interesting picture of forest governance, growing in transparent structures of popular participation, but has exposed deficiencies in the sector, as the absence of a strong institutional framework which leads to legal uncertainty and policy.

TI  - Direct and cascading effects of landscape structure on tropical forest and non-forest frugivorous birds
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by land-use change, but the direct and indirect drivers of species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes are poorly known. Forest-dependent species are expected to be particularly sensitive to changes in landscape composition (e.g., forest loss) and configuration (e.g., increase of forest edges), both directly and indirectly through cascading landscape effects on local patterns of forest structure and resource availability. In contrast, non-forest-dependent species are probably more strongly related to landscape changes than to local forest patterns, as these species are able to use resources not only from the forest, but also from other landscape elements over larger spatial scales. We tested these hypotheses using structural equation modeling. In particular, we sampled 20 landscapes (115 ha each) from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to assess the effect of landscape-scale forest cover and amount of forest edges on the diversity of frugivorous birds, both directly and indirectly through the effect that these landscape variables may have on vegetation complexity and fruit biomass. We separately assessed the response of forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent frugivores to infer potential mechanisms underlying bird assemblages in fragmented landscapes. The diversity of forest-dependent birds mainly decreased with the simplification of vegetation complexity in more deforested landscapes, but increased with increasing fruit biomass in more forested landscapes (indirect effects). Both patterns were significant, thus supporting a strong bottom-up control, i.e., local habitat simplification and resource scarcity in highly deforested landscapes limits the maintenance of forest-dependent birds. Conversely, but as expected, non-forest-dependent birds were more strongly and directly related to landscape-scale patterns. In particular, landscapes with higher forest edge amount showed higher bird species diversity, probably because the increasing length of ecotones and interspersion/juxtaposition of different habitat types in landscapes with more forest edges can increase resource availability and foraging efficiency of non-forest-dependent birds. As the seed dispersal services offered by forest-dependent species cannot be ecologically compensated for by the proliferation of non-forest-dependent species, preventing forest loss is imperative to maintain forest-dependent birds and forest regeneration in this vanishing biodiversity hotspot.

Understanding how matrix dynamics, especially secondary forest regrowth, can lessen fragmentation impacts is key to understanding species persistence in modified landscapes. Here, we use a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment to investigate how bat assemblages are influenced by the regeneration of the secondary forest matrix. We surveyed bats in continuous forest, forest fragments and secondary forest matrix habitats, similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance, to investigate temporal changes in the occupancy and abundance of old-growth specialist and habitat generalist species. The regeneration of the second growth matrix had overall positive effects on the occupancy and abundance of specialists across all sampled habitats. Conversely, effects on generalist species were negligible for forest fragments and negative for secondary forest. Our results show that the conservation potential of secondary forests for reverting faunal declines in fragmented tropical landscapes increases with secondary forest age and that old-growth specialists, which are often of most conservation concern, are the greatest beneficiaries of secondary forest maturation. Our findings emphasize that the transposition of patterns of biodiversity persistence in island ecosystems to fragmented terrestrial settings can be hampered by the dynamic nature of human-dominated landscapes.

TI  - Seed Bank from Abandoned Pastures in the Coastal Region of Parana
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seed bank of three contiguous areas: pasture abandoned for ten years, with soil amended by partial beheading for two years at horizon A (area I); pasture identical to the previous example, but with recent mobilization of the topsoil (area II); area in the early stages of regeneration (area III). Field work was conducted in Morretes-PR, in an area of evergreen rain forest. In November 2013, seed bank samples were collected from ten points per area (0.30 x 0.30 m) and at three depths (0-3 cm + litter, 3.1 to 6.0 cm and 6.1 to 9.0 cm). We obtained 25.151 seeds m(-2), distributed between 85 species. The predominant life form was herbaceous (98%), with the Cyperaceae family being the most abundant. In the seed banks of the three areas, only a few seeds from a restricted number of woody species were found, which therefore, represents a limited resource for forest restoration purposes.

TI  - Assessing Sumatran Peat Vulnerability to Fire under Various Condition of ENSO Phases Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau's peatland as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change.

TI  - How the Adequate Choice of Plant Species Favors the Restoration Process in Areas Susceptible to Extreme Frost Events
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the impacts caused by extreme frost events in an ecological restoration area. We grouped the species in three ways: (1) type of trichome coverage; (2) shape of the seedling crown; and (3) functional groups according to the degree of damage caused by frost. The variables of the restored area and species characteristics were selected to be subjected to linear generalization analysis models (GLMs). A total of 104 individuals from seven species were sampled. The most affected species were Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (98% of leaves affected), followed by Cecropia pachystachia Tr & eacute;cul and Hymenea courbaril L. (both 97%), Inga vera Willd. (84%), and Senegalia polyphylla (DC.) Britton & Rose with 75%. Tapirira guianensis Aubl. was considered an intermediate species, with 62% of the crown affected. Only Solanum granulosoleprosum Dunal was classified as slightly affected, with only 1.5% of leaves affected. With the GLM analysis, it was verified that the interaction between the variables of leaf thickness (Chi(2) = 37.1, df = 1, p < 0.001), trichome coverage (Chi(2) = 650.5, df = 2, p < 0.001), and leaf structure culture (Chi(2) = 54.0, df = 2, p < 0.001) resulted in a model with high predictive power (AIC = 927,244, BIC = 940,735, Chi(2) = 6947, R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.001). Frost-affected crown cover was best explained by the interaction between the three functional attributes (74%). We found that there is a tendency for thicker leaves completely covered in trichomes to be less affected by the impact of frost and that the coverage of the affected crown was greatly influenced by the coverage of trichomes. Seedlings with leaves completely covered in trichomes, thicker leaves, and a funneled or more open crown structure are those that are most likely to resist frost events. The success of ecological restoration in areas susceptible to extreme events such as frost can be predicted based on the functional attributes of the chosen species. This can contribute to a better selection of species to be used to restore degraded areas.

TI  - TOPOGRAPHY AND SEASONALITY PROMOTES TAXONOMIC BETA DIVERSITY OF SEEDLINGS IN A TROPICAL WETLAND
T2  - Oecologia Australis
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal beta diversity of seedlings in tropical wetland remain poorly understood. We assessed the ecological pattern of taxonomic beta diversity of seedling assemblages along a topographic gradient, seasonally flooded disturbance, and sampling years in a tropical wetland. We tested that seasonally flooded disturbance on seedling assemblage promotes a high taxonomic beta diversity due to a high taxonomic turnover along the topographical gradient. Here we examined a large database from 200 plots (each having 0.5 x 0.5 m), across eight seasonally flooded grasslands in the Pantanal of central-west Brazil. We selected data on ponds for four years at two characteristic hydrological phases per year: post-flood (July and August), and post-dry season (October and November). We classified the topographical gradient into three levels 1) low-longer duration of flood; 2) mid-intermediate level; and 3) high-short duration of flood (dry soil). For both post-flood and post-dry seasons, we counted the number of seedlings within five plots at each topographic level. Additionally, taxonomic beta diversity was examined via novel abundance-based metrics (including both turnover and nestedness patterns). Overall, taxonomic beta diversity was consistently higher in high topographic level and post-dry season plots. We observed differences in beta diversity components between topographical levels, seasons and years. Topographical gradient and seasonally flooded promotes more variation in taxonomic turnover and beta diversity; due to these environmental filters we presume that the resulting beta diversity can be decisive in the species diversity in this tropical wetland.

TI  - AUTOECOLOGY, DIVERSITY, AND INTERNAL GENETIC STRUCTURE OF Ocotea porosa (NEES & MART.) BARROSO: SUBSIDIES FOR SEED COLLECTION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration mitigates the negative effects of fragmentation and habitat loss. This practice allows the conservation of key species, such as Ocotea porosa, a tree native to the Araucaria Forest and extremely endangered. A key point in restoration projects is the source of seeds, as well as guidelines for collection. When carried out under technical criteria, the collection allows the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptive potential in restoration plantations. Given the importance of seed source, genetic diversity, and adaptive potential, this study aimed to define areas and criteria for collecting seeds by characterizing the demography, genetics, and reproductive phenology of an O. porosa population. A plot of 16 hectares was installed in the municipality of Passos Maia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and a demographic survey of trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 15 cm was carried out. Indices of diversity and internal genetic structure (IGS) were estimated using allozyme markers. The reproductive phenology of 67 individuals was evaluated during 8 months. The studied population showed a high density of individuals (10.7 ind. ha(-1)) with normal diametric distribution. The phenological pattern of the species is regular, seasonal, and annual. The evaluated population showed high genetic diversity, high fixation index, and significant IGS up to 80 meters away. Based on these results, the evaluated fragment can be used as a seed collection area. It has high genetic diversity, density, and area size sufficient to contain several demes. In addition, it is highly recommended that the matrices be at least 80 meters apart to avoid the effects of significant IGS.

TI  - The native psyllid Mastigimas anjosi (Hemiptera: Calophyidae): first record and abundance on pink cedar, Cedrela fissilis (Meliaceae), trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and report on the occurrence of Psylloidea damaging pink cedar, Cedrela fissilis Vell. (Meliaceae), plants in the municipality of Sorocaba, in the southern region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Psyllids were collected on C. fissilis plants, and sent to authorities for identification. Psyllids damaging C. fissilis plants in urban areas and fragments of semideciduous seasonal forest were identified as Mastigimas anjosi Burckhardt, Queiroz D., Queiroz E., Andrade, Zanol Rezende & Kotrba (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Calophyidae), which is native to Brazil. Cedrela fissilis also is endemic to Brazil, and has high ecological and economic value. It is harvested for timber production and is on the endangered species list. This is the first report of M. anjosi damaging C. fissilis plants in Sao Paulo State, Brazil and the importance of this plant for conservation and ecological restoration areas in Brazil justifies research to develop management programs for this psyllid.

TI  - Defining national biogenic methane targets: Implications for national food production & climate neutrality objectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas (GHG) modelled distinctly from long-lived GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide to establish global emission budgets for climate stabilisation. The Paris Agreement requires a 24-47% reduction in global biogenic methane emissions by 2050. Separate treatment of methane in national climate policies will necessitate consideration of how global emission budgets compatible with climate stabilisation can be downscaled to national targets, but implications of different downscaling rules for national food production and climate neutrality objectives are poorly understood. This study addresses that knowledge gap by examining four methods to determine national methane quotas, and two methods of GHG aggregation (GWP100 and GWP*) across four countries with contrasting agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sectors and socio-economic contexts (Brazil, France, India and Ireland). Implications for production of methane-intensive food (milk, meat, eggs and rice) in 2050 and national AFOLU climate neutrality targets are explored. It is assumed that methane quotas are always filled by food production where sufficient land is available. Global methane budgets for 1.5 degrees C scenarios are downscaled to national quotas based on: grand-parenting (equal percentage reductions across countries); equity (equal per capita emissions); ability (emission reductions proportionate to GDP); animal protein security (emissions proportionate to animal protein production in 2010). The choice of allocation method changes national methane quotas by a factor of between 1.7 (India) and 6.7 (Ireland). Despite projected reductions in emission-intensities, livestock production would need to decrease across all countries except India to comply with quotas under all but the most optimistic sustainable intensification scenarios. The extent of potential afforestation on land spared from livestock production is decisive in achieving climate neutrality. Brazil and Ireland could maintain some degree of milk and beef export whilst achieving territorial climate neutrality, but scenarios that comply with climate neutrality in India produce only circa 30% of national calorie and protein requirements via rice and livestock. The downscaling of global methane budgets into national policy targets in an equitable and internationally acceptable manner will require simultaneous consideration of the interconnected priorities of food security and (land banks available for) carbon offsetting.

TI  - Global forest restoration opportunities to foster coral reef conservation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment runoff from disturbed coastal catchments is a major threat to marine ecosystems. Understanding where sediments are produced and where they are delivered enables managers to design more effective strategies for improving water quality. A management strategy is targeted restoration of degraded terrestrial areas, as it provides opportunities to reduce land-based runoff from coastal areas and consequently foster coral reef conservation. To do this strategically, a systematic approach is needed to identify watersheds where restoration actions will provide the highest conservation benefits for coral reefs. Here, we develop a systematic approach for identifying global forest restoration opportunities that would also result in large decreases in the flux of sediments to coral reefs. We estimate how land-use change affects sediment runoff globally using high-resolution spatial data and determine the subsequent risk of sediment exposure on coral reefs using a diffusion-based ocean transport model. Our results reveal that sediment export is a major issue affecting 41% of coral reefs globally. The main coastal watersheds with the highest sediment export are predominantly located in Southeast Asian countries, with Indonesia and the Philippines accounting for 52% of the sediment export in coastal areas near coral reefs. We show how restoring forest across multiple watersheds could help to reduce sediment export to 63,000 km(2) of coral reefs. Although reforestation opportunities in areas that discharge onto coral reefs are relatively small across watersheds, it is possible to achieve large sediment reduction benefits by strategically targeting watersheds located in regions with a high density of corals near to the coast. Thus, reforestation benefits on coral reefs do not necessarily come from the watersheds that produce the highest sediment export. These analyses are key for generating informed action to support both international conservation policy and national restoration activities.

TI  - Strategies for herbivory mitigation by capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris in a riparian forest under restoration in the Sao Francisco river basin Brazil
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the potential use of diversionary feeding and behavior-contingent sonic deterrents to mitigate the herbivory impacts of capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris on a riparian forest restoration site in the watershed of the Velhas River, the main tributary of the S. Francisco River in southeastern Brazil. Paspalum notatum, popularly known as batatais or bahia grass, was chosen as a diversionary food candidate and motion-activated sonic alarms were used as deterrents. A field experiment was conducted to compare the plant cover and the damage incidence in a fenced-off control on open plots with and without sonic deterrents. In these plots, P. notatum was cultivated alongside other restoration species of interest. Capybaras distinctly preferred P. notatum, which suffered 8.14-fold greater damage than other species and suffered coverage losses of up to 40% outside of the control plots, whereas the remaining species showed no difference from the control. The sonic deterrents did not influence the soil cover by any of the species, but did mitigate the damage to P. notatum independently of time. The damage was 93% more prevalent in the plots without deterrents. This success was partial, however, because damage also occurred in the presence of the deterrents. P. notatum was efficient at attracting and concentrating the interest of capybaras and therefore showed promise as a cover crop to protect other species of interest. Overall, the results of this study suggest that P. notatum is more efficient than electronic deterrents to protect a forest under restoration process against capybara damage.

AB  - Monoculture of pine alters the soil fauna community structure, but forest farms, mixed with natural areas, are restoring the original vegetation to protect, the diversity and ecosystem functions. In restoration initiatives it is necessary to consider the soil fauna. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how the process of restoration of the soil community occurs over time in areas after pine harvesting. Areas in natural regeneration with 4 and 10 years, pine plantations adjacent to these areas (representing previous use), and areas of natural forest (reference) were evaluated, it was evaluated three areas per treatment, with six sampling points spaced 30 m apart, totalling 18 sampling points for each treatment (n = 18). Soil mesofauna and macrofauna were collected through soil monoliths and pitfall traps. The comparison of the statistical analysis was to check for changes in the soil fauna over time (4 and 10 years) compared with that observed in secondary forest areas. The study showed that, along the natural regeneration time (4 and 10 years), it was observed increments in the diversity and evenness of the soil community and a reduction in the dominance of groups like Formicidae and increases in the community structure complexity with the resurgence of micropredators/regulators (Collembola and Acari), litter transformers (Oligochaeta, Diplopoda, Blattodea, Coleoptera (Larva), Diptera (Larva) and Coleoptera) and predators (Pseudoscorpiones, Opiliones, Symphyla and Coleoptera) after 10 years of natural regeneration, the areas have already recovered groups with important ecosystem functions, but are not yet at the level of abundance, functional diversity and community structure of native forest areas. The 4- and 10-year regeneration areas present major number of soil fauna groups of native forest (20 groups in regeneration areas and 17 in the native forest areas). Even so, the forest showed a major complexity of soil fauna community structure, evidenced by the diversity. This study contributes to the understanding of natural regeneration for soil fauna along a temporal gradient and these findings can guide the conservation of regional soil fauna diversity.Over the time of regeneration, there were gains in soil fauna groups. Micropredators/regulators, litter transformers and predator groups were recovered. Regeneration had less dominant soil fauna groups and higher community complexity. Ten years was not enough time for achieving soil community structure like a forest. image

TI  - Mapping of the Successional Stage of a Secondary Forest Using Point Clouds Derived from UAV Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The definition of strategies for forest restoration projects depends on information of the successional stage of the area to be restored. Usually, classification of the successional stage is carried out in the field using forest inventory campaigns. However, these campaigns are costly, time-consuming, and limited in terms of spatial coverage. Currently, forest inventories are being improved using 3D data obtained from remote sensing. The objective of this work was to estimate several parameters of interest for the classification of the successional stages of secondary vegetation areas using 3D digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A cost analysis was also carried out considering the costs of equipment and data collection, processing, and analysis. The study was carried out in southeastern Brazil in areas covered by secondary Atlantic Forest. Regression models were fit to estimate total height (h), diameter at breast height (dbh), and basal area (ba) of trees in 40 field inventory plots (0.09 ha each). The models were fit using traditional metrics based on heights derived from DAP and a portable laser scanner (PLS). The prediction models based on DAP data yielded a performance similar to models fit with LiDAR, with values of R-2 ranging from 88.3% to 94.0% and RMSE between 11.1% and 28.5%. Successional stage maps produced by DAP were compatible with the successional classes estimated in the 40 field plots. The results show that UAV photogrammetry metrics can be used to estimate h, dbh, and ba of secondary vegetation with an accuracy similar to that obtained from LiDAR. In addition to presenting the lowest cost, the estimates derived from DAP allowed for the classification of successional stages in the analyzed secondary forest areas.

TI  - Riparian restoration for protecting water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change in riparian zones is one of the most significant threats to water quality in watershed ecosystems. Riparian forests play a major role in protecting water quality, and there is a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water quality in a tropical agricultural watershed. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapui River watershed, located in southeast Brazil. We observe a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Watersheds with agricultural and some residential areas had a higher sediment and nutrients loads than forest and with pasture land uses, especially during the wet season. Forested watersheds in general had a better water quality than other LULC types. Riparian restoration in the study watershed can reduce suspended sediment (9.26%), total nitrogen (22.6%), and total phosphorus (7.83%). Protecting riparian zone and site-conservation practices is critical to improve water quality. We observe that the simulation model provides a satisfactory baseline of the watershed system to evaluate impacts of land use changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Short-term responses of native tree species to site conditions after mining in the Central Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring mining areas is a hard challenge to tropical silviculture, given the high levels of degradation caused by the removal of forest cover and decrease to soil quality. It is necessary to know the soil limitations for planting and the adequate treatments to revert these limitations and select good-performance species. The monitoring based on functional traits can contribute to the selection of the most suitable species for mining restoration projects. Here, we investigated the functional performance of native tree species as modulated by site conditions after cassiterite mining in the Central Amazon. We planted saplings of seven Amazonian tropical tree species in three site conditions (Stripping, Grasses, and Tailings), and measured soil properties, survival, growth, and 15 photosynthetic leaf traits ten months after planting. Silvicultural treatments enhanced the chemical properties in all site conditions (e.g. increase in bases saturation), and physical properties in some site conditions (e.g. reduction of penetration resistance in Stripping). The performance (survival and growth) and traits changed more among species than sites. Species with high photosynthetic resource use efficiency had better performance. Pseudobombax munguba was the species with the highest performance and can be indicated as a key species for the efforts of restoration in the region. Select species with traits similar to those of P. munguba can lead to greater success in restoration projects of mining areas in the Amazon.

TI  - Thinning temporarily stimulates tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data.

TI  - Potential of three homogeneous forest plantations as facilitators of natural regereneration of tree and shrub species
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations established in the transition region between field and forest can catalyze the natural regeneration of other species to create more favorable microsites for seed germination and seedling development. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of three homogeneous forest plantations as facilitators of natural regeneration of trees and shrubs species. Plantations of Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub. (canafistula); Handroanthus heptaphyllus (Vell.) Mattos (ipe-roxo); and Hovenia duicis Thunb. (uva-do-japao) were inventoried in 24 plots randomly installed in each plantation. Individuals with height >= 1m were measured. The highest species density (5.2 sp 100 m(-2)) and the highest individuals density (10.4 ind 100 m-2) were observed in plantation of "ipe-roxo", where the pioneer species Varronia curassavica (RNR = 20, 11%) and Baccharis sp. (16.98%) were the most representative. The highest average (3.3 m) and ampleness of height (1.0 <= height <16.0 m) were verified in plantation of "canaffstula", where the species Piper amalago L. showed the highest value of RNR (18.38%). The species itself was the most representative of its understory (RNR= 34.15%) in the plantation of "uva-do-japao". This plantation showed the smallest amplitude in diameter (0.3 <= DBH < 11.8 cm). These results indicate that the native species "canafistula" and "ipe-roxo" have potential to be used as facilitators of natural regeneration of other native species, influen-

TI  - Forest recovery by direct seeding on the southern edge of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Broad-scale parameters are crucial for the restoration of forest to align with the United Nations resolutions for the "Decade on Ecosystem Restoration." Direct seeding is a moderately priced, active method with potential use in forest recovery. This study evaluated the recovery of woody vegetation from 23 restored forests (RF) located on the southern edge of the Brazilian Amazon, a region known as the "Arc of Deforestation". We ask: (1) What are the differences in abundance, species richness, and alpha diversity between seeded and regenerated species in RF? (2) How does the structure, floristic composition, species richness, and alpha diversity of RF compare with adjacent primary forests (PF)? After 12 years of intervention, our results reveal that RFs exhibited lower species richness, alpha diversity, aboveground biomass (AGB), basal area, and dissimilar floristic composition when compared to PFs. Recovery in PFs reached 40% for AGB, 55% for basal area, 24% for alpha diversity, and 60% for species richness. These findings indicate ongoing recovery of evaluated parameters, highlighting the success of the seeding method in restoring degraded riparian forests. We also observed similar species richness between seeded and regenerated species in RFs, yet absolute density, AGB, and alpha diversity were higher in seeded species. The notable presence of non-seeded species in our plots provides evidence that direct seeding fosters spontaneous regeneration from the regional species pool. Our findings suggest that direct seeding is a viable option for restoring forest structure and diversity in areas with limited or no potential for passive regeneration.

TI  - Forest restoration methods, seasonality, and penetration resistance does not influence aboveground biomass stock on mining tailings in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration methods applied on the areas affected by the Fundao tailings dam collapse have a high priority in Mariana region. We evaluated the effect of different restoration methods and site preparation techniques, depth and seasonality on penetration resistance of tailings, and how these predictors affect tree aboveground biomass in areas affected by the Fundio dam collapse in Mariana, Brazil. No significant differences in penetration resistance and aboveground biomass between treatments were observed, but significant differences were observed between seasonal periods. The main univariate model explained the significant effects of depth and seasonality, mainly by a negatively wet effect on penetration resistance. According to the best models (univariate and multivariate) were those that had depth as a predictor. This study showed how penetration resistance can be an indicator to select the best period for restoration process in areas affected by the collapse of the Fundao dam, but no limit to the aboveground biomass recovery on tailing.

TI  - Limited Edge Effects Along a Burned-Unburned Bornean Forest Boundary Seven Years after Disturbance
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Large parts of the everwet tropics have been burned, leaving many unburned-burned forest edges. Here we studied a Bornean forest edge to determine: (1) how unburned and burned forest differ in vegetation structure, diversity, composition and plant functional traits 7 yr after fire, and (2) if these variables showed significant edge effects. Environmental and inventory data from 120 plots (0.01 ha each), covering both sides of a similar to 1.3 km forest boundary were sampled. Differences in vegetation structure, diversity, composition and plant functional traits were analyzed in relation to disturbance type (Mann-Whitney tests) and edge distance (partial correlation analysis that controlled for confounding effects of elevation, slope and fire intensity). Seven years after fire, burned forest differed significantly from unburned forest in most measured variables while few significant edge effects were detected, i.e., there existed a sharp delimitation between the two forest types. The regeneration of the burned forest depended almost entirely on in situ recruitment with little input of late successional species from the neighboring old growth forest. On the other hand, old growth forest showed few signs of edge degradation. A possible explanation for these results might be related to the absence of a mast fruiting event during these first 7 yr of forest recovery, resulting in low levels of late successional species seed input into the burned forest, combined with the quick development of a closed canopy in the burned forest by early successional species that shielded the unburned forest from adverse edge effects.

TI  - Earlier biomarkers in fish evidencing stress responses to metal and organic pollution along the Doce River Basin*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Doce River Basin (DRB) represents a well-described watershed in terms of contamination by metals, especially after a major environmental disaster of a mining tailing dam failure. Despite the massive mortality of the ichthyofauna, very few studies addressed the risks to the health of wild fish exposed to complex mixtures of pollutants from multiple sources. The present study proposed to investigate earlier responses of fish for assessing the impacts of multiple sources of pollution, considering: different niches of fish and target organs; and the influence of seasonality, associated with their probable sources of pollution. To achieve that, fish were collected along the DRB, and biomarkers responses were assessed in target organs and correlated with the levels of inorganic and organic contaminants. As one of the most prominent responses, fishes from the Upper DRB showed the highest expression of the metallothionein and oxidative stress parameters which were related to the higher levels of metals in this region due to the proximity of mining activities. On the other hand, higher levels of DNA damage and increased AChE activity from fish sampled in the Mid and Lower DRB were more associated with organic contaminants, from other sources of pollution than mining residues. The integrated biomarker responses also revealed seasonal variations, with higher values in fishes from the dry season, and pelagic fish showing greater variation within the seasons. The multivariate analysis integrating suitable biomarkers with chemical data represented an adequate strategy for assessing the ecological risks in the DRB, allowing the identification of distinct spatio-temporal impacts from multiple sources of contaminants. The continued exposure of the ichthyofauna representing future risks reinforces the need for ecological restoration and the protection of the fauna from the Doce River.

TI  - Harvestmen in an Atlantic forest fragmented landscape: Evaluating assemblage response to habitat quality and quantity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of considering arthropods in monitoring programs and conservation planning given their diversity in terrestrial ecosystems and potential in revealing environmental disturbances, most studies on the effects of habitat disturbances in tropical forests focused on vertebrates, plants and a few arthropod groups. By sampling 16 sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories (continuous mature and secondary forest and large and small secondary forest fragments), we investigated how harvestmen (Opiliones), which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests, are affected by habitat quality and quantity. Richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality.(first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure), increasing in less disturbed/mature forests. Richness, total abundance, abundance of rare species and of one of the three common species were higher in continuous forest, while only total abundance differed between large and small fragments. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments, while several others were associated with continuous and/or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments. Our results suggest that harvestmen (1) are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity, probably because, compared to other arthropod groups, they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects (nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility); (2) are probably more indicative of intermediate-level disturbances, given the absence of species associated with highly-disturbed areas.(C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Natural regeneration on land degraded by coal mining in a tropical climate: Lessons for ecological restoration from Indonesia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are few examples of primary succession from tropical conditions, especially on land degraded by human activity, for example, mine wastes. Such studies would assist in informing ecological restoration of these degraded sites. Here, a chronosequence approach was used to investigate early-stage primary succession on overburden spoil wastes derived from coal mining in a tropical climate over a 64-month period. Plant species composition and several microclimatic and spoil physicochemical and microbial properties were measured, and responses analysed using regression and multivariate (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) analyses. A clear primary successional process was described showing that vegetation cover and species richness generally increased through time with a successional pathway from graminoids and herbs as the early dominants, shrubs in midsuccession, and trees in the later-successional stages. Two important differences were noted between our results and primary successions elsewhere; a lower abundance of nitrogen-fixing species and the colonization by some late-successional shrubs and trees at the start. During the succession, aggregate stability and organic matter (total C) increased-whereas electrical conductivity and some potentially toxic elements (Al, B) decreased. The constant high spoil moisture content appears to be an important determinant of vegetation development during primary succession and may be a factor in the rapid pace of succession detected here. The lessons for ecological restoration for coal overburden spoil under tropical conditions are that succession can proceed relatively rapidly.

TI  - Can partnerships and community-based conservation reverse the decline of coral reef social-ecological systems?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine aquarium trade has played an important role in shaping the ecological state of coral reefs in Indonesia and much of the Asia-Pacific. The use of cyanide by ornamental fishers in Buleleng District, Bali, in the 1980s and 1990s has resulted in a precipitous decline in the ecological health of reefs. Cyanide-free harvesting techniques were introduced after 2000, along with reef restoration measures. This paper examines social and ecological processes in the fishing village of Les, Bali, in ending the use of cyanide and the resulting ecological restoration. An emphasis on conservation-development (with livelihood objectives) was important in securing interest and cooperation across stakeholder groups. Adaptive approaches to governance and knowledge co-production were also important. The strategy used at Les is now being exported to other communities across Indonesia, and provides a promising example of a marine resources-based conservation-development initiative that may be implemented at other, similar communities.

TI  - USING BARE-ROOT AND ROOTSTOCK SEEDLINGS FROM NATURAL REGENERATION OF CEDRELA FISSILIS
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of forest creation relies on seedling availability and quality. The aim of this research is to assess the possible use of rootstock and bare-root seedlings of Cedrela fissilis obtained from natural regeneration for direct field planting. We used Generalized Linear models to assess survival and Hierarchical Models to assess height growth over one year after planting. Initial root-collar diameter (RCD) and treatment (rootstock or bare-root) affected survival and growth. Rootstock and larger seedlings presented higher levels of survival and growth. Higher seedling quality in the rootstock treatment is due to higher water stress tolerance. Rootstock seedlings with more than 1 cm of initial RCD had over 80% of survival probability, while small bare-root seedlings had mean survival probability as low as 20%. Rootstock seedlings grew as much as fourfold more than bare-root. Using natural regeneration of C. fissilis as a source of rootstock seedlings may be a cheap alternative for forest restoration and enrichment planting projects.

TI  - Implementing Brazil's Forest Code: a vital contribution to securing forests and conserving biodiversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Meeting Brazil's ambitious national commitments on both climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation depends on securing its reserves of forest carbon and biodiversity. Brazil's 'Forest Code' is a key tool to reconcile environmental preservation and agricultural production; it limits deforestation and requires forest restoration in illegally deforested areas. However, not all provisions of the law's 2012 revision have yet been implemented and some are facing new challenges. Using modelled land use change projections for the whole of the country, we show that full implementation and enforcement of the law has the potential to contribute to conserving biodiversity. Biodiversity outcomes will be especially positive if (i) deforested areas are restored in ways that support recolonization by native species and (ii) additional measures are implemented to protect native vegetation in areas like Caatinga dry forests and Cerrado savannas, which may experience added pressure displaced from other regions by Forest Code implementation.

TI  - Regeneration response of Brazilian Atlantic Forest woody species to four years of Megathyrsus maximus removal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5 x 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10 cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guineagrass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives.

TI  - Ecological restoration and protection of remnants are key to the survival of the critically endangered Araucaria tree under climate change
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia - 'araucaria'- is a critically endangered conifer tree of great ecological, economic, and cultural importance occurring in subtropical forests and grasslands in southern Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling we estimated its distribution in the present and future scenarios (2050), assessed sources of uncertainties, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas, and indicated suitable sites for restoration efforts to maintain viable populations. For this, we generated and compared 11,484 models with different combinations of variables and parameters. The final model included variables related to climate, soil, and topography. The potential distribution of araucaria was estimated to be 489.8 x 10 3km2, with a predicted reduction in 2050 from 45% to 56% (SSP245 and SSP585, respectively). The reduction within remaining habitats is estimated to range from 32% to 44%. Combined, current habitat availability and climate change accounted for a reduction from 70% to 75% of the potential distribution. Only 5% of the current potential distribution is within protected areas, which may be reduced to 1%. In addition, 40% of suitable sites in remaining habitats are not protected, which may reduce to 24-28% in 2050. Restoration efforts may contribute to an increase of 42-45% of the remaining population. We show that estimates of araucaria distribution in the future are variable and dependent on climate projections and scenarios, however, the potential distribution in natural grasslands may remain stable. Coordinated actions involving the protection and restoration of habitats associated with population growth are urgent to improve the persistence of araucaria in the future.

TI  - Distinct tree regeneration patterns in Araucaria forest and old monoculture tree plantations
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world, plantations of tree species (native and exotic) for production purposes make up an important part of tree cover, often at the expense of natural forests. Monocultures of exotic and native species generally show a very distinct vegetation physiognomy when compared to natural forests. In the case of abandoned plantations, existing tree regeneration may provide a high potential for restoration of these areas. In this study, we evaluated composition and structure of the adult (upper layer) and regenerative (lower layer) tree component of natural Araucaria forest and of monoculture plantations of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze and Pinus sp., and their relationship with edaphic variables and sunshade discontinuity. We aimed to answer the following questions: To which extent do regeneration patterns of native species in the plantations resemble those in natural forests? Does natural regeneration provide a potential for transformation of plantations into natural forests? Does the exotic species regenerate in high abundances, and do other exotic/invasive species establish? Which environmental factors influence regeneration of native species? We expected to find differences in the species composition of the planted areas in relation to the native forest, and more pronounced in the regenerative component. Therefore, the soil parameters and the canopy discontinuity should also be distinct in the distinct vegetation formations. Density of species and tree individuals of the regenerative layer was significantly lower in the plantations, especially in the pine plantation, at the plot level. However, overall species richness was quite similar between vegetation types, with a total of 98 species distributed into 38 families. While light availability did not differ significantly, the soil parameters organic matter, pH, phosphorus and potassium showed significant differences among the vegetation types (in general, lower fertility in plantations). These variables were related to the specific composition of areas, indicating influence of the vegetation on soil conditions and regeneration patterns. Overall, we conclude that restoration of plantations into natural forest based on the existing forest regeneration seems possible, but should be done with caution and under monitoring.

TI  - Carrots, Sticks and the Brazilian Forest Code: the promising response of small landowners in the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Forest Code has been in existence more than 80 years but has largely been ineffective in reducing deforestation in the Amazon due to a lack of adherence and enforcement. Recent revisions to the law reduced the restoration requirements for Areas of Permanent Preservation (APP) and Legal Reserve (LR) and established new tools to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation and strengthen the supervision and monitoring of protected areas. The goal of these changes is to facilitate compliance, encourage environmental conservation, and strengthen the monitoring of protected areas. This paper investigates the probability that a household in Rondonia, Brazil will set aside land for permanent preservation and, once this decision is made, the extent of restoration. Our results suggest that-even in a region that is heavily deforested and under conditions of weak enforcement-households are complying with the law by developing formal plans for restoration. Most important, we find that access to extension agents, existing APP guidelines, and other policy levers (such as environmental licensing) have made a significant impact on the development of these plans suggesting that the 2012 Forest Code has the potential to impact future land restoration decisions.

TI  - Genetic diversity among Hymenaea courbaril L. genotypes naturally occurring in the north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hymenaea courbaril L. is a tropical tree species with economic and medicinal potential largely used in programs for the recovery of degraded areas. The use of molecular markers in genetic studies can help in the definition of forest restoration strategies. This study was conducted to analyze the genetic diversity among H. courbaril ('jatoba') genotypes naturally occurring in the north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, using ISSR markers, aiming to contribute to the development of seed collection and seedling production strategies. Twenty-four H. courbaril individuals were sampled by collecting leaves for DNA extraction by the CTAB method. The individuals were genotyped using 14 ISSR primers, resulting in the amplification of 87 bands in total, 65 of which were polymorphic. The ISSR markers presented average polymorphism information content of 0.44. Dissimilarity values based on the Jaccard coefficient ranged from 0.12 to 0.52. The most divergent individuals were 3 and 22, whereas 14 and 19 were the most genetically similar. The UPGMA and Tocher clustering methods indicated the formation of four distinct groups, revealing genetic variability among the 24 H. courbaril genotypes. Therefore, all the evaluated genotypes can be used for seed collection and seedling production, but the most divergent individuals should be prioritized.

TI  - Passive Restoration of Atlantic Forest Following Pinus taeda Harvesting in Southern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The understory of exotic tree plantations can have non-negligible native species richness. Ecological restoration of these sites may include the harvest of trees, depending on the tradeoff between timber income and harvest impacts on biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate how a site can recover from harvest disturbance, by comparing the regeneration of woody species in the understory of two types of 37-year-old Pinus taeda plantation (P1 and P2, high and low relative density of pine seedlings in the understory, respectively), with stands that were similar to P2 but subjected to harvest and then abandoned for 15years (R sites). Secondary forests (SF) were used as references. We sampled three different sites for each stand condition; soil chemical properties, estimations of litter mass, and canopy cover were measured. P1 had low species diversity, and P2 and R had 50 and 46% of SF richness, respectively. The R site contained few pine saplings and was floristically similar to P2; this indicated that 15years was sufficient for the recovery of plant diversity to near pre-harvesting levels. Soil fertility was highest in SF and lowest in P1. Thus old plantations of P. taeda with low relative density of pine juveniles can be cost-effective starting points for restoration. Despite the destructive effects of pine harvest, recovery of native species can occur rapidly. In situations in which clearcutting of pine stands is not planned or possible, modest thinning of P. taeda adults and/or intensive thinning of juveniles could expedite restoration.

TI  - Floristic inventory and conservation of one of the most striking coastal mountains in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is made up of different vegetation types over extensive latitude. Most of its remnants are in mountain ranges, which are responsible for the maintenance of most endemic and threatened species in this domain. Here we present the floristic composition of the area de Protecao Ambiental Mestre alvaro (APAMA), a coastal massif at Espirito Santo State with expressive altitudinal amplitude (100-800 a.s.l.) containing remnants never floristically studied. Knowing the composition of this protected area is important because it includes an altitudinal range not yet evaluated in floristic comparisons involving highland and lowland forests between the latitudes 18-21 degrees S. We found 493 species (in 292 genera and 91 families): ten are regional endemic species, nine are new records of occurrence for the state, and 52 are under some degree of threat of extinction. Our results indicate the presence of flora elements' typical of both highland and lowland forests, which makes the APAMA essential in a scenario extremely fragmented. Finally, our data provide an unprecedented floristic list for regional forest restoration projects, as well as an invaluable source of data for biogeographic studies that seek to understand the effect caused by neighboring vegetation types on the composition of lowland forests.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities shaped by host-plant affect the outcome of plant-soil feedback in dryland restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can be a useful tool to overcome challenges in dry forest restoration. However, advances are still needed to guide choices regarding soil origin and inoculum production methods, since outcomes can vary due to plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). We evaluate how soil origin and host plant used for inoculum production affect AMF community and therefore the plant biomass accumulation and functional traits. In the conditioning phase, we investigated whether soils originating from a recovered area (Quarry) and a vegetation fragment (Caatinga) would have their AMF communities modified due to the growth of Sorghum bicolor (used for inoculum production) and Senna uniflora (used in Brazilian semiarid restoration). In the feedback phase, we compared the performance of four plants species growing on a degraded soil and inoculated or not by a mixture of AMF isolates in comparison to soil inoculum prepared from the conditioning phase. The inoculum from Caatinga presented seven times more AMF species compared to that from the Quarry, which presented ruderal and stress tolerant species. The soil inoculum conditioned by S. uniflora, regardless of origin, presented greater evenness compared to the soil inoculum produced with S. bicolor and promoted 33% more plant biomass compared to the control without inoculation. Root colonization by AMF increased PSF and decreased plant investment in functional traits such as specific root length (SRL) and specific leaf area (SLA). Our results demonstrate the importance of adopting strategies that preserve local adaptation of inoculants produced. The use of native plant for propagation of native AMF in the conditioning phase provided more positive responses for Mesosphaerum suaveolens and Rhaphiodon echinus than inoculated with introduced AMF isolates. This is probably due to the interaction of inoculated plants with responsive AMF present in the soil. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that conditioning field-collected soil with Senna uniflora and using it for inoculation can be a simple technique to promote biomass accumulation for other native herbaceous species. This preserves the compatibility between the soil inoculum produced with native AMF and native plants, representing an important tool for restoration programs.

TI  - Direct seeding reduces costs, but it is not promising for restoring tropical seasonal forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding is a potential technique to restore forests; however, further studies are needed before its application on a large scale. We carried out a field experiment in a deforested area in southern Brazil to test the technical and economic feasibility of a direct seeding system with high tree species diversity to restore the tropical seasonal forest. We also compared species performances and tested the effects of seed size and successional group on tree seedling emergence and development. The trial was established at two different sowing times using 31 tree species. For two years after sowing we evaluated seedling emergence, establishment, survival and early growth of tree species, weed competition and costs for plantation establishment and early maintenance. Most species had low seedling emergence and establishment, but high survival rates, implying that low seedling emergence is the main barrier to community assembly that must be overcome. The most successful species had larger seeds, belonged to non-pioneer categories and had slower growth rates. Final costs after two years were lower than has been reported in the literature for most restoration planting using seedlings both in Brazil and elsewhere; however, seedling density was low. Although direct seeding may be a feasible alternative to decrease planting costs, the poor species performances and low seedling density may reduce its applicability. Thus, we recommend direct seeding only in association with the planting of pioneer species seedlings.

TI  - Afforestation effects on vegetation structure and diversity of grasslands in southern Brazil: The first years
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of afforestation on the composition and structure of southern Brazilian subtropical grasslands directly beneath tree plantations, in pastures, and in permanent protection areas near watercourses. Cover of plants was registered in 120 plots of 1 m(2) in grasslands located at two distances from small watercourses in pasture and eucalypt plantation areas within a livestock ranching landscape. Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant. Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form increased markedly, as well as standing herbs. These increases occurred mainly at the expense of prostrate herbs and subshrubs, which were significantly reduced. Plot-level species density was significantly affected by distance from watercourse and, more importantly, was significantly influenced by the interaction between management regime and distance to watercourse. It was reduced in eucalypt plantations relative to permanent protected areas. Current management of eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil produce unsuitable conditions for grassland species to thrive within plantations. Livestock densities <1.0 animal unit ha(-1) in eucalypt plantations undermines the ability of surrounding permanent protection areas to act as ecological networks for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Conflicts and opportunities for commercial tree plantation expansion and biodiversity restoration across Brazil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial global restoration commitments are occurring alongside a rapid expansion in land-hungry tropical commodities, including to supply increasing demand for wood products. Future commercial tree plantations may deliver high timber yields, shrinking the footprint of production forestry, but there is an as-yet unquantified risk that plantations may expand into priority restoration areas, with marked environmental costs. Focusing on Brazil-a country of exceptional restoration importance and one of the largest tropical timber producers-we use random forest models and information on the economic, social, and spatial drivers of historic commercial tree plantation expansion to estimate and map the probability of future monoculture tree plantation expansion between 2020 and 2030. We then evaluate potential plantation-restoration conflicts and opportunities at national and biome-scales and under different future production and restoration pathways. Our simulations show that of 2.8 Mha of future plantation expansion (equivalent to plantation expansion 2010-2020), similar to 78,000 ha (3%) is forecast to occur in the top 1% of restoration priority areas for terrestrial vertebrates, with similar to 547,500 ha (20%) and similar to 1,300,000 ha (46%) in the top 10% and 30% of priority areas, respectively. Just similar to 459,000 ha (16%) of expansion is forecast within low-restoration areas (bottom 30% restoration priorities), and the first 1 Mha of plantation expansion is likely to have disproportionate impacts, with potential restoration-plantation overlap starkest in the Atlantic Forest but prominent in the Pampas and Cerrado as well. Our findings suggest that robust, coherent land-use policies must be deployed to ensure that significant trade-offs between restoration and production objectives are navigated, and that commodity expansion does not undermine the most tractable conservation gains under emerging global restoration agendas. They also highlight the potentially significant role an engaged forestry sector could play in improving biodiversity outcomes in restoration projects in Brazil, and presumably elsewhere.

TI  - Litter as an Ecological Indicator of Forest Restoration Processes in a Dense Ombrophylous Lowland Forest
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of spacing, species richness, and sampling time on accumulated litter in forest restoration areas in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The experiment was conducted under a randomized complete block design, in a subdivided plot scheme. Six treatments were evaluated, consisting of a combination of spacing levels and species richness. Accumulated litter samples were weighed and chemically analyzed to obtain nutrient concentrations. The variables analyzed in the restoration process, in general, did not influence litter biomass and nutrient concentrations. The time elapsed between restoration implantation and data sampling for the present study may have been insufficient for the occurrence of differences in variables evaluated. Despite the small amount of accumulated litter, it is of great importance for soil physical protection and fertility improvement, generating conditions for the stabilization of new forest species in the restoration area.

TI  - Conversion from Forest to Agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon from 1985 to 2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon biome are key processes that influence the environment and societies at local, national, and global scales. Numerous studies have already relied on land-cover and land-use maps to analyze change processes. This study presents a new dataset created by calculating the time required for deforested areas to transition to agriculture (annual and permanent crops) in the Brazilian Amazon biome. The calculations were performed over MapBiomas land-cover data (version 7), which range from 1985 to 2021, at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The method consists of basic algebraic operation and recursion to identify every conversion from forest to agriculture between 1985 and 2021. The results show a correlation between environmental policies and the time required for the conversion to be completed, such as the adoption of the soy moratorium and the New Forest Code, that were followed by a search for old cleared areas for the establishment of new agricultural sites. The new data can be useful in interdisciplinary studies focused on land-use and land-cover change analysis in Brazil, such as planning of forest restoration initiatives, and the evaluation of carbon stocks according to conversion length. Our accuracy assessment shows an opportunity to improve conversion length calculations by reducing errors in the classification of agriculture establishment. The major innovation of this study is the establishment of explicit links between the deforestation year of a given pixel and its respective year of agriculture establishment, which can provide new insights into understanding long-term land-use conversion processes in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Identification of Priority Areas for Ecological Restoration in Eastern Para, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to identify priority areas for the passive restoration of the Arauai river basin, municipality of Moju, Para, using a multicriteria model. This basin is located in a region with intense land use dynamics and expansion of oil palm cultivation, and with high forest loss and fragmentation. The Weighted Linear Combination method was used, with the aggregation of five criteria (Natural Erosion Vulnerability, Potential Land Use and Cover to Passive Restoration, Proximity to the Primary Forest, Forest cover deficit in PPAs, and Distance from Roads and Highways). This analysis allowed to evaluate different biophysical classes and types of land use that affect the selection of areas for restoration. A total of 207.82 km(2) of priority areas for passive restoration were identified in the studied basin, with about 80% of its priority areas having medium to very high priority. The final map generated proved to be a useful instrument in the environmental management of restoration plans in the Amazon watershed.

TI  - POTENTIAL OF Eucalyptus grandis AS FACILITATOR OF NATURAL REGENERATION
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of regeneration of native species under homogeneous forest planting is considered an important factor for the maintenance of the diversity and the wealth of native forest species. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the natural regeneration of the underbrush of an Eucalyptus grandis stand, located in the municipality of Frederico Westphalen, RS. There were installed 10 parcels of 10 m x 10 m, in which there were measured all the individuals with equal or higher height than 1 m. The sampled species were distributed in height classes or diameter classes and classified in relation to the successional class and dispersal syndrome. There were calculated the indexes of Shannon diversity and of Pielou evenness. In total, there were sampled 414 individuals; the floristic of the area includes 32 species distributed in 20 families and 30 genera. The Myrtaceae family, presented the greatest richness of species, and the Prunus myrtifolia and Sebastiania commersoniana were the species with greater number of individuals. The index of Shannon diversity was estimated in 2.36 nats. ind.-1. The natural regeneration showed itself diverse, with predominance of initial and later secondary species, highlighting that the stand of Eucalyptus grandis performed as facilitator of natural regeneration.

TI  - From overgrazed land to forests: assessing soil health in the Caatinga biome
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overgrazing is the primary human-induced cause of soil degradation in the Caatinga biome, intensely threatening lands vulnerable to desertification. Grazing exclusion, a simple and cost-effective practice, could restore soils' ecological functions. However, comprehensive insights into the effects of overgrazing and grazing exclusion on Caatinga soils' multifunctionality are lacking. This study examines (i) how overgrazing impacts multiple soil indicators, functions, and overall soil health (SH) and (ii) whether natural early forest growth post-grazing exclusion enhances critical soil functions for ecosystem restoration. We compared preserved dense forests, longterm overgrazed pastures (over 30 years), and young fenced-off open forests (three years old) along a longitudinal transect in the Caatinga biome: 36 degrees W (Sao Bento do Una), 37 degrees W (Sertania), and 40 degrees W (Araripina). Soil samples from the 0-20 cm layer were analyzed for thirteen physical, chemical, and biological indicators for a structured SH assessment, calculating index scores based on soil functions. Forest-to-pasture transition and subsequent overgrazing consistently compacted the soils and decreased nitrogen, carbon (C), microbial biomass C, and glomalin protein, thus degrading the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions. Regionally, this conversion depleted 14.7 Mg C ha(-1) and reduced overall SH scores by 18%, severely impacting biological functions ( e.g.,-43% for sustaining biological activity). No significant differences in functions or SH were found between grazed pastures and open forests. SH scores and C stocks were highly interrelated (r > 0.5; p < 0.001), suggesting that C losses and SH deterioration were closely aligned. We conclude that overgrazing degrades soil multifunctionality and health across the Caatinga biome, with biological functions most severely damaged and legacies obstructing soil recovery for up to three years of grazing exclusion. Future SH studies should include open forest chronosequences with older ages and active restoration practices ( e.g., planting trees or green manure) to enhance Caatinga's ecological restoration knowledge and efforts.

TI  - Monitoring of an Indonesian Tropical Wetland by Machine Learning-Based Data Fusion of Passive and Active Microwave Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel data fusion approach was used to monitor the water-body extent in a tropical wetland (Lake Sentarum, Indonesia). Monitoring is required in the region to support the conservation of water resources and biodiversity. The developed approach, random forest database unmixing (RFDBUX), makes use of pixel-based random forest regression to overcome the limitations of the existing lookup-table-based approach (DBUX). The RFDBUX approach with passive microwave data (AMSR2) and active microwave data (PALSAR-2) was used from 2012 to 2017 in order to obtain PALSAR-2-like images with a 100 m spatial resolution and three-day temporal resolution. In addition, a thresholding approach for the obtained PALSAR-2-like backscatter coefficient images provided water body extent maps. The validation revealed that the spatial patterns of the images predicted by RFDBUX are consistent with the original PALSAR-2 backscatter coefficient images (r = 0.94, RMSE = 1.04 in average), and that the temporal pattern of the predicted water body extent can track the wetland dynamics. The PALSAR-2-like images should be a useful basis for further investigation of the hydrological/climatological features of the site, and the proposed approach appears to have the potential for application in other tropical regions worldwide.

AB  - The sustainability or degradation of the environment can be estimated, among others, for the evaluation and monitoring of sensitive soil attributes for the use and management over time. Understanding the changes resulting from management uses in different systems can assist in the knowledge of ecological processes that advocate restoration ecology. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the soil quality based on its chemical attributes in different uses, being five areas in ecological restoration, an area of native vegetation and a sugarcane crop, all locations in a rural property in Rio Brilhante city, MS, in a transition area between the Cerrado-Mata Atlantica Biomes. The chemical attributes evaluated were: organic matter (OM), pH, cation exchange capacity (CTC), sum of bases (SB), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (V%) and potential acidity (H + Al). The data were submitted to multivariate analysis, among them: the principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering. The PCA indicated, among the studied areas, the areas under ecological restoration 1 (REC1) presented a lower relation with soil chemical attributes (except for the potential acidity in the surface layer) and showed greater similarity with a sugarcane cultivation area. On the other hand, REC3 presented a better soil chemical quality and greater similarity with native vegetation area, thus evidencing that the vegetation cover development and a mechanization absence were important to promote an improvement of soil quality. The data obtained suggest that the new forms of management in restoration areas imply different levels of soil system quality, tending to increase stability and biological integrity, changes that are part of the ecological processes common to preserved ecosystems.

TI  - The Determination of Priority Areas for the Restoration of Degraded Tropical Peatland Using Hydrological, Topographical, and Remote Sensing Approaches
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Degraded peatland is caused by forest clearing and the construction of artificial water networks. When water management is not implemented across land uses in the entire peatland landscape, then it will be a big issue that causes a water deficit and leads to increasing droughts and fires. Effective restoration must first identify the part of Peatland Hydrological system Units (PHUs) with insufficient water storage and resources. This study used intercorrelated factors of water balance, deficit months, NDMI-NDVI indices, dry periods, recurrent fires, peat depth, and water loss conditions, as the evaluation parameters, within individual sub-PHUs to determine the most degraded areas that require intervention and restoration. Sub-PHU was determined based on the peat hydrological unity concept by identifying streamline, outlet channels, peat-depth, slopes, and network connectivity. Global hydrological data using TerraClimate and CHIRPS, combined with field observations, were used to validate and calculate each sub-PHU's water balance and dry periods. Soil moisture (NDMI), vegetation density (NDVI), and fire frequency were extracted from multispectral satellite images (e.g., Landsat 8, MODIS-Terra, and MODIS-Aqua). Each parameter was ranked by the score for each sub-PHU. The parameters that can be ranked are only the ordinal type of number. The lowest ranks indicated the most degraded sub-PHUs requiring peat rewetting interventions.

TI  - Sucessional trajetories of bird assemblages in amazonian secondary forests: Perspectives from complementary biodiversity dimensions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests occupy extensive areas in tropical regions, providing an opportunity to investigate their relevance to biodiversity restoration. However, determining the conservation value of secondary forests and evaluating their successional trajectories depends on how biodiversity is measured. Here, we explore different biodiversity dimensions to understand how bird assemblages recover from forest disturbance caused by small scale farmers in the Amazon. We sampled bird species through standard visual and auditory censuses in 24 small plots of 1-hectare distributed in a paired design of old growth forests and secondary forests from different age categories (early, middle and late succession). We used 12 biodiversity metrics to explore the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions of bird diversity. Total species richness and evenness was similar between secondary and old growth forests. In contrast, the number of passerine species and disturbance-vulnerable species were higher in the controls of old growth forests compared to secondary forests. The relative abundance of birds with distinct functional traits consistently differed between the secondary forests of different age categories and their old growth forest counterparts. Functional evenness and divergence increased with canopy height and basal area through forest regeneration. In contrast, bird phylogenetic diversity in secondary forests was higher compared to those found in old growth forests while accounting for forest types and age categories of secondary forests. Bird species tolerant to disturbances partially compensate the loss of avian taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity during the conversion of undisturbed forests to agricultural fields. Changes in functional evenness and functional divergence suggest that resources used by birds are altered along the secondary succession and that the niche complementarity among species is reduced in more intensively managed sites. Ecological succession can be highly complex in terms of taxa identity, their functional roles and evolutionary history. Therefore, measurements that explore distinct biodiversity dimensions are fundamental to understanding how species are organized in assemblages across time and space.

TI  - Bee pollinator functional responses and functional effects in restored tropical forests.
T2  - Ecological Applications
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild pollinators are necessary for ensuring plant reproduction, not only among crop fields but also remnant and restored ecosystems. Restoration activities should, therefore, lead to wild pollinator recovery, and thus be monitored to evaluate effects on pollinator diversity and functionality. We assessed bee pollinator functional responses in restoration plantings by creating functional groups (traits: body size, nesting location, sociality, and foraging strategy), comparing their abundance and diversity to that of other habitats (i.e., conserved and degraded primary forest fragments, anthropogenic wetlands, and sugarcane fields), and testing for an effect of source habitat (i.e., primary forest fragments) isolation. We analyzed functional effects on pollen transportation by identifying the pollen grains attached on the bodies of bees; creating plant functional groups with the identified species (traits: habit, successional class, geographic origin, and pollination mode); comparing their frequency, diversity, and interaction network structure among habitats; and searching for key interactions in network modules. In general, the abundance and diversity of bee communities and the frequency and diversity of the interacting plant species in restoration plantings were lower than those in primary forest fragments but higher than those in anthropogenic wetlands and sugarcane fields, suggesting that restoration plantings better enhance bee community recovery and functionality than other disturbed habitats. The interacting bees and plants were also negatively affected by habitat isolation, demonstrating the importance of primary forest fragments to supply bee populations to restored sites. The structure of interaction networks was little affected by habitat change and isolation, but the composition and diversity of functional groups varied significantly. There were more effects on larger bee species with more restricted nesting and floral requirements, and the woody species with which they interact most frequently. We identified key functional groups of bee pollinators that deserve priority for conservation because they play an important role in the pollen transportation of some the most relevant species in remnant forests and restoration plantings and also respond more negatively to habitat disturbances. Restoration efforts should include provisioning of nesting resources and management and conservation of primary forest remnant fragments that represent source habitats for them.

TI  - Changes in plant species composition and functional traits along the successional trajectory of a restored patch of Atlantic Forest
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the dynamics of ecosystems undergoing restoration are needed to verify whether they are following the expected trajectory, developing in unexpected ways, or becoming stabilized in a non desirable intermediate stage of blocked succession. In order to elucidate the successional trajectory of the plant community in a 20 ha patch of riparian Atlantic Forest (southeastern Brazil) undergoing restoration, we assessed native tree and shrub species regenerating at 18, 28 and 38 years after planting. We analyzed changes in floristic composition and proportions of functional traits, by comparison with the set of 166 species originally planted most of which were non-native, and with the plant assemblages of two reference riparian ecosystems - a primary-type and a secondary forest, in the same eco-region. Despite isolation from extant forests, immigrating native species have enriched and dominated the community undergoing restoration. Thus, the floristic composition and the proportions of species among functional guilds is becoming more distinct through time from the set of species planted and more similar to the nearest secondary forest (1.6 km), but is still dramatically different from that of a primary forest 50 km away. The proportions of functional guilds among individuals regenerating have shown stability over time but differ in general from the primary forest, particularly for the higher proportion of zoochorous plants in the forest undergoing restoration. The proportion of non-native species as well as of individuals of these species in the community have decreased over time, even though they were the majority of the species planted, refuting the hypothesis of priority effect driving the community assembly.

TI  - Analysis of effectiveness of three forest interventionist techniques and proposal of a new and integrated model of forest restoration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the efficacy of three different forest intervention techniques, in terms of phytosociological and edaphic responses, that were implemented in 2007. In a farm where trees are planted and managed for cellulose production as well as set aside for environmental conservation, four stands were analysed: three of them were considered degraded and were managed using different intervention techniques (transposition, perch, and abandonment), and a fourth stand comprising pristine vegetation was considered a control (reference). Floristic and phytosociology data were collected in three 10x10m plots established in each stand. Also, a total of 48 soil samples were collected to analyse physical and chemical attributes of the topsoil for the different stands. In terms of biodiversity, all the treatments showed significantly lower values when compared to the reference area. However, the soils in all the treatment and reference stands are similar in terms of physical and chemical attributes. Taking into account the specificities of each restoration technique, we verified that the integrated use of a set of management practices, constituted by the (1) abandonment of the area and (2) following a selective killing of the eucalyptus, is the most suitable and promising model to provide fast and effective restoration in terms of environmental indicators.

TI  - EVALUATION OF DIRECT SEEDING AND SEEDLING PLANTING OF TWO NEOTROPICAL TREE SPECIES WITH THE USE OF NATURAL INPUTS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding of native tree species could be a low cost alternative for forest restoration. The paper aimed at evaluate direct seeding of two species from Southern Brazil, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and Citharexylum solanaceum Chamisso, comparing with seedling planting. The effects and costs of forest topsoil and forest litter addition were also evaluated in the direct seeding. The experiment was accomplished during 2009/2010. The treatments of direct seeding were CONTROL - control without seeding, TSEED - only seeding, TLITTER-seeding with forest litter cover, TTOPSOIL - seeding with forest topsoil, TBOTH - seeding with forest litter and with forest topsoil, LTCONTROL - control with forest litter and forest topsoil. The species C. solanaceum did not germinate at field. The species S. terebinthifolius had higher germination in the TBOTH, either at 30 days (21.6%) and 360 days (9.0%), which correspond to a density of 9,000 plants . ha(-1) after 360 days. The litter singly contributed less to the survival than the forest soil, however a synergic effect between the two inputs was observed. The TBOTH presented a higher growth (42 cm of plant height at 360 days). The costs of direct seeding with inputs (singly or combined) were higher than the conventional seedling planting in relation to the area unity. However, the cost of direct seeding without addition of inputs was higher considering the cost per survivor seedlings. Planted seedling of S. terebinthifolius reached 88.5 cm of height after 360 days. Seedlings of S. terebinthifolius generated by direct seeding reached the average of 5.1 and 42.0 cm of height in the TSEED and TBOTH treatments, respectively.

TI  - Does fipronil application on roots affect the structure of termite communities in eucalypt plantations?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fipronil is an insecticide used for termite control in forest plantations. Although pest species need to be restricted, the effects on non-target termites are unknown. The effects of fipronil application on the termite community composition, species richness and functional group diversity were assessed in four different treatment plots (new eucalyptus plantations respectively treated and untreated with fipronil; naturally regenerating secondary forest and the parent native Brazilian savanna) at three different times (90 days before and 90 and 180 days following) clonal seedling planting. A total of 53 termites species belongs to families Termitidae and Rhinotermitidae were collected. The mean richness of termite species differed significantly among the treatments and times. Grass feedings showed the highest overall richness in the plot under natural regeneration 90 days before planting. Soil feedings had higher richness in the control treatment (native savanna) and in the plot under regeneration at 180 days after planting. No significant differences in richness of wood feedings termites were detected in any comparison. Termite assemblage composition in the new eucalyptus plantations did not differ between the fipronil-treated and fipronil-untreated plots. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ichthyofauna from 3 streams (Agua Boa, Perobao, and Santa Maria) to the lower Iguatemi River were inventoried, which is located in the upper Parana river basin, in Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. Sites in the upper, intermediate, and lower portions of each stream were quarterly electrofished from March to December 2008. All sampled fish (n = 6,816 individuals) represented 43 species of 5 orders, and 16 families. The most abundant species was Phalloceros harpagos (63.5%), followed by Astyanax aff. paranae (10.6%), Hypostomus ancistroides (5.9%), Gymnotus inaequilabiatus (3.4%), and Knodus moenkhausii (2.7%). Despite the high ichthyofauna richness in the lower portion of Iguatemi River, the need to implement and/or expand soil conservation practices and riparian forest restoration is of utmost importance to maintain these populations in the long term.

TI  - Predicting plant performance for the ecological restoration of grasslands: the role of regenerative traits
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Active restoration of grassland ecosystems often requires the addition of species as seeds. However, knowledge of seed germination and initial performance of native species are still lacking in many regions, including the Brazilian grasslands. Regenerative traits (such as seed traits) have the potential to predict performance parameters related to the initial establishment of a species in a given environment. This study aimed to test the potential of regenerative traits as predictors of the performance of grassland species, information which may be useful for ecological restoration purposes. Using 15 grassland species, we carried out three parallel experiments at different conditions: cabinet, greenhouse, and field. Three performance parameters were evaluated: final germination percentage (FGP), germination rate index (GRI), and survival rate. The suitability of seed traits (mass, area, and shape) as predictors of performance parameters was evaluated for each experiment using linear regression models. Performance parameters varied among the species and experiments, but seed mass and shape slightly influenced GRI. Seed area had a positive effect on GRI, and there was a significant interaction between seed circularity and mass, which improved the GRI of round, heavy seeds. FGP and survival rate were not predicted by any of the traits. Our study highlights the importance of testing fitness-trait relationships under field conditions, which may reflect the real challenges species will face in restoration projects. Our results reinforce the need of considering regenerative traits and interaction factors to improve the understanding and prediction of the initial performance of species.

TI  - Tropical Timber Species Grow Faster in Full Sun Than in the Understory of Restoration Plantings
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical timber species are generally shade tolerant, but preliminary studies have indicated that greater light availability can accelerate their growth. In this study, we hypothesized that native timber species can grow faster initially when planted in full sun alongside the pioneer species in high-diversity restoration plantings compared with being planted in the understory of an established forest restoration. We assessed the mortality, relative growth in height (RGH) and stem diameter (RGDGL) of eight native timber species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest 19 months after planting. Overall seedling mortality was similar across planting conditions, and only Handroanthus heptaphyllus exhibited higher mortality in the shaded planting. The RGH and RGDGL of most species was higher in full sun planting. Therefore, our findings indicate that those tropical timber species grow faster and have higher survival rates when planted in open areas.Study Implications: We evaluated the initial growth and mortality of eight timber species native to the Atlantic Forest, focusing on their performance in forest restoration across two distinct conditions: full sun alongside pioneer species, and natural shade beneath an established canopy. Late successional timber species exhibit accelerated initial growth rates when planted in full sunlight compared with under an established forest canopy due to the greater light intensity. Our findings strongly support the practice of planting native timber species in full sun alongside pioneer species. This approach also provides logistical advantages, potentially reducing costs compared with staggered planting methods.

TI  - Community-based management induces rapid recovery of a high-value tropical freshwater fishery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetlands are highly threatened socio-ecological systems, where local communities rely heavily on aquatic animal protein, such as fish, to meet food security. Here, we quantify how a 'win-win' community-based resource management program induced stock recovery of the world's largest scaled freshwater fish (Arapaima gigas), providing both food and income. We analyzed stock assessment data over eight years and examined the effects of protected areas, community-based management, and landscape and limnological variables across 83 oxbow lakes monitored along a similar to 500-km section of the Jurua River of Western Brazilian Amazonia. Patterns of community management explained 71.8% of the variation in arapaima population sizes. Annual population counts showed that protected lakes on average contained 304.8 (+/- 332.5) arapaimas, compared to only 9.2 (+/- 9.8) in open-access lakes. Protected lakes have become analogous to a high-interest savings account, ensuring an average annual revenue of US$10,601 per community and US$1046.6 per household, greatly improving socioeconomic welfare. Arapaima management is a superb window of opportunity in harmonizing the co-delivery of sustainable resource management and poverty alleviation. We show that arapaima management deserves greater attention from policy makers across Amazonian countries, and highlight the need to include local stakeholders in conservation planning of Amazonian floodplains.

To capture the wasps, we used bait traps during the period from 2006 to 2009. During this period 369 social wasps were collected, constituting ten species belonging to four genera. In order to compare these three areas ecological indexes were calculated. Fragments with natural regeneration or restoration program showed the greatest diversity of wasps, being Epiponini wasps the most frequent collected individuals. Some wasp species were more tolerant to disturbance than others. Furthermore, climatic factors affected the presence of wasps in all the fragments, increasing the number of individuals at the summer and autumn where occur the highest temperatures and levels of precipitation. These results explain the importance of natural corridors in adjacent areas with different levels of regeneration.

TI  - An analysis of the floristic composition and diversity of Amazonian forests including those of the Guiana Shield
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A large number of newly published and unpublished hectare plots in Amazonia and the Guiana Shield area allow an analysis of family composition and testing of hypotheses concerning alpha-diversity in the south American rain forest. Using data from 94 plots the family-level floristic patterns in wet tropical South America are described. To test diversity patterns, 268 plots are used in this large area. Contrary to a widely held belief, western Amazonian plots are not necessarily the most diverse. Several central Amazonian plots have equal or even higher tree diversity. Annual rainfall is not a good estimator for tree diversity in the Amazonia area and Guiana shield. Plots in the Guiana Shield area (and eastern Amazonia) usually have lower diversity than those in central or western Amazonia. It is argued that this is not because of low rainfall or low nutrient status of the soil but because of the small area of the relatively isolated rain forest area in eastern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield. The low diversity on nutrient-poor white sand soils in the Amazon basin is not necessarily due to their Low nutrient status but is, at least partly, caused by their small extent and fragmented nature.

TI  - What Can Restoration Do for Bee Communities? An Example in the Atlantic Rainforest in Parana State, Southern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity conservation is a challenge for today. Studies regarding different ecosystems have become extremely important for understanding communities and promoting strategies for conservation, especially those involving forest restoration as strategy to reverse biodiversity loss. We compared bee diversity indices between three remnants of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil and four adjacent areas that were reforested after shale mining, and which are now under different restoration levels. Seven sites were monitored for over 5 years (2011-2016), by sampling bees directly on flowers or in flight using an entomological net, with 400 collected individuals/site/year. Bee species composition differed between post-mining ages and between sites. In all, we sampled 14.185 specimens and 236 bee species. The introduced Africanized Apis mellifera Linnaeus was the most frequent and abundant species, followed by Trigona spinipes and Psaenythia bergii Holmberg. Among habitats, the reforested area in initial phase showed lower richness and diversity in relation all others sample sites. Conversely, all indices were higher in forest remnants, middle phase II, and advanced phase reforested areas, reinforcing the importance of reforestation for conservation, notably endangered species, such as Oxytrigona sp., Schwarziana quadripunctata (Lepeletier), and the solitary species of the genus Hylaeus, all found in the restored areas. These results represent an important contribution for understanding the recovery of the bee fauna in restored mining habitats. The dataset reveals an interesting response in areas that were mined for shale extraction and are now undergoing different levels of restoration, suggesting that older reforested habitats have a higher probability of having a fully recovered bee community.

TI  - MANUAL CROWNING VERSUS CARDBOARD IN FOREST RESTORATION: COSTS AND EFFECT ON SEEDLING DEVELOPMENT
T2  - PLANTA DANINHA
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive grasses are one of the biggest obstacles to be overcome in restoration plantations. Thus, developing efficient and low-cost techniques to overcome this obstacle is a challenge for science and the ecological restoration practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of cardboard for the crowning operation on the growth of forest tree species from the Atlantic Forest biome and on the operating costs of this technique in a reforestation implemented in Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro state. The predominant vegetation of the area was of Andmpogon bicornis L. An experiment was installed in randomized blocks, with two treatments and 12 replications. The treatments consisted of crowning with cardboard and crowning with hoc. The used cardboard (50 x 50 cm) were pretreated with a preservative solution with CuSO4. Treatments were applied to 11 forest species from the Atlantic Forest biome: Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul, Cithamylum myrianthum Chain. , Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Veil.) Morong, Eugenia brasiliensis Lain, Eugenia uniflora Lam, I-fandroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos, Hymenaea courbaril L., Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd., Plinia cauliflora (Mart.) Kausel, Plathymenia reticulata Benth. e Triplaris americana L. Evaluations were carried out as for height, diameter at collar height (DCH) and survival rate, 6, 12 and 18 months after planting. The costs of each crowning method were also quantified. Overall, the height, DCH and growth rates did not differ between the crowning treatments for the species evaluated. However, the cardboard crowning treatment showed a higher survival rate (80%) of plants, compared with the hoc crowning (73%). The cost of the crowning with cardboard over a 12-month period was 40% lower than that of the crowning with hoe. These results show that the cardboard crowning technique can be a viable and a cost effective alternative to replace the crowning with hoe in reforestation areas with species from the Atlantic Forest biome.

M3  - Article
AB  - - (Seed bank analysis and species similarity in the Air Force Base of Pirassununga (Sao Paulo State, Brazil)). Riparian forests suffered from forest fragmentation, which in turn promote the change in the pattern of seed dispersion and modification of soil seed bank. The aim of this study is to indicate the main species that make up the seed bank of a stretch of riparian forest of the Mogi Guagu River continued to a fragment of semidecidual forest, located in the Air Force Base of Pirassununga. It was delimited ten plots of 10 x 10 m. Four soil samples was collected by plot with a 25 x 25 cm template. Samples were packed in greenhouse for seed germination and monitored every 15 days for six months. Altogether, 494 individuals from 19 families were sampled, distributed in 30 genera and 40 morphospecies. Diversity and distribution of species in the fragment is homogeneous and can be used as source of propagules for forest restoration.

TI  - A genetic approach for simulating persistence of reintroduced tree species populations in restored forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals, isolated from neighboring populations, and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human-modified landscapes. Resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas. Such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances. However, the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated. We present an individual-based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of: 1) differing levels of initial genetic diversity; and 2) different area sizes on short (tens of years) and mid-term (hundreds of years) restored population viability. We demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of Centrolobium tomentosum, a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics, from tropical and temperate forests, to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size. This knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions, increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs.

TI  - BEES AND WASPS (HYMENOPTERA) AS ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS IN A FOREST RESTORATION AREA
T2  - Oecologia Australis
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the response of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) to environmental restoration, one assemblage of a restoration fragment was compared to six other primary forest fragments in western Parana, Brazil. Bees and wasps were sampled in five fragments in 2013 and the remainder, including the fragment undergoing restoration, in 2014. The samples were collected by bowl-traps in blue and yellow colors, between 9 am and 3 pm, during February, March and April. The number of traps varied with the perimeter of the areas to ensure a proportional sampling effort. In total, 21 samples were taken, with sampling effort of 126 h. The restoration fragment presented ecological indexes values (H', D and Dmn) statistically equal to those of the largest sampled forest fragments, but it has different species in relation to other forest fragments. The main species to differentiate the assemblages of the forest and restoration fragments were identified by SIMPER analysis. Generally, the common species of forest fragments showed a significant correlation (rs < 0.05) with area descriptors. However, there was no association between the main species of the restored fragment and the area descriptors (rs > 0.05). The fragment in restoration provides opportunity for a diverse colonization and presents its own composition of bees and wasps, but still different from the six reference fragments and so it is still not considered as restored.

TI  - How bird community responds to different ages of reforestation? Implications for restoration of a highly threatened Atlantic Forest phytophysiognomy.
T2  - Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the bird composition, forest dependence, trophic guilds and avian representativeness associated with 7, 10 and 15 years old reforestations and mature forest patches in order to verify the successional process and avian contribution to the forest restoration. Analyses revealed a segregation of bird composition with a gradual increasing in forest dependent species from 7 years to mature forest. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ranged from those birds often present in semi -open habitats to forest birds, canopy frugivorous and understory insectivorous as the successional stages progressed from the most recent reforestation to the most mature. Although 7 and 10 years of reforestation had the largest composition range, the more generalist, granivorous and forest independent birds, three years were enough to have different bird diversity between them. Avifauna of 15 years patches resembled most closely that of mature forest but still lacked 18 species. In this way, we addressed: 1) planting of herbaceous/shrub and freshy-fruited species in reforestations and; 2) establish riparian forest corridors along the Parana river to connect these reforestation patches with mature forest. These measures will allow higher avian beta -diversity to maximize the diaspores dispersed by birds to expand and accelerate the rehabilitation of this

TI  - Compensating for past deforestation: Assessing the legal forest surplus and deficit of the state of Para, eastern Amazonia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Up to 80% of each private rural property in the Brazilian Amazon is protected by law through the Legal Reserve (LR) mechanism of the federal Forest Code, underlining the conservation importance of forests on private lands in one of the worldis most important biomes. However, our understanding of the discrepancies in levels of forest protection on private lands as obligated by the law versus what occurs in practice remains very poor. We assessed patterns of forest cover and legal compliance with the Forest Code in the 1.25 Mkm(2) Brazilian state of Para, which has the highest deforestation rate in the Amazon. We evaluate the LR deficit and surplus patterns for different sized properties and across 144 municipalities, and found that the total LR surplus (12.6 Mha) was more than five times the total area of deficit (2.3 Mha). Yet, from the total surplus, only 11% can be legally deforested while the remaining 89% is already protected by law but can be used (sold or rented) to compensate for areas that are under deficit. Medium and large-scale properties make up most of the total LR deficit area, while agrarian reform settlements had comparatively large amounts of both compensation-only surplus and deforestable surplus. Most of the municipalities (77%) in the state could compensate their total deficit with surplus areas of LR in the same municipality, while the remainder can be compensate their deficit in one or more neighbouring municipalities, indicating compensation can always take place close to the source of the deficit. Maximising the environmental benefits of achieving Forest Code compliance requires measures that go beyond the existing legal framework, including interventions to avoid further deforestation in places where it is still legal, compensate in close proximity to areas with legal reserve deficit and promote local restoration on degraded lands.

TI  - Lessons on direct seeding to restore Neotropical savanna
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical grassland-savanna mosaics are threatened globally, but they are challenging to restore because highly competitive pasture grasses inhibit recovery and are not shaded out by the patchy tree cover. We analyzed the outcomes of restoration projects and experiments established over four years in 55 ha of abandoned pastures dominated by invasive C4 grasses within the Neotropical savanna, Central Brazil. We tested the efficacy of direct seeding native grasses, forbs, shrubs and trees in reducing invasive grass cover and increasing native ground cover. We performed a series of experiments aimed at answering questions about the effect of seeding density, soil plowing to control invasive grasses, life form of ground cover species (grass, forb or shrub) and soil type on restoration outcomes. Relative native cover reached 34 +/- 3% three rainy seasons after the first seeding experiment. Higher seeding densities and more soil plowing repetitions increased relative native cover. Soil type interacted with the life form of ground cover species to strongly influence relative native cover; two years after seeding, the highest relative native cover was achieved in rocky soils seeded with grasses (78 +/- 6%) and the lowest was for seasonally waterlogged soils seeded with shrubs (15 +/- 4%). Direct seeding can effectively establish many native Neotropical savanna species of different life forms with better restoration outcomes on rocky soils and with higher seeding densities. Further research is urgent to improve restoration methods, especially to control invasive grasses, to be able to achieve the large-scale restoration targets set internationally.

TI  - Paternity analysis reveals significant isolation and near neighbor pollen dispersal in small Cariniana legalis Mart. Kuntze populations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the world, large trees are increasingly rare. Cariniana legalis is the tallest tree species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, reaching up to 60m in height. Due to extensive deforestation of the Atlantic Forest, remnant C. legalis populations are small and spatially isolated, requiring the development of strategies for their conservation. For insitu and ex situ genetic conservation to be effective, it is important to understand the levels and patterns of spatial genetic structure (SGS), and gene flow. We investigated SGS and pollen flow in three small, physically isolated C. legalis stands using microsatellite loci. We measured, mapped, and sampled all C. legalis trees in the three stands: 65 trees from Ibicatu population, 22 trees from MGI, and 4 trees from MGII. We also collected and genotyped 600 seeds from Ibicatu, 250 seeds from MGI, and 200 seeds from MGII. Significant SGS was detected in Ibicatu up to 150m, but substantial levels of external pollen flow were also detected in Ibicatu (8%), although not in MGI (0.4%) or MGII (0%). Selfing was highest in MGII (18%), the smallest group of trees, compared to MGI (6.4%) and Ibicatu (6%). In MGI and MGII, there was a strong pattern of mating among near-neighbors. Seed collection strategies for breeding, insitu and ex situ conservation and ecological restoration, must ensure collection from seed trees located at distances greater than 350m and from several forest fragments.

AB  - Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important as global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas have been abandoned, there is little evidence for the subsequent recovery of forest. As part of a study of forest degradation and recovery, we assessed seed rain into an area of non-forest regrowth in degraded tropical peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: an abandoned attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Fifty seed traps were placed in the open and fifty under trees. Seeds were collected every 15 +/- 3 days for 1 year. Seed rain and foreign seed rain (species different from the tree over the trap) was higher for traps under trees (1127.8 seeds and 465.0 seeds m(-2) y(-1) respectively) than for traps in the open (95.2 seeds m(-2) y(-1)). Foreign seed rain consisted largely of species that also grow in mature forest, but was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly from the woody liana, Uncaria elliptica, and the tree, Combretocarpus rotundatus) and the majority of animal-dispersed foreign seeds were found under trees. While seed rain both in the open and under trees appears sufficient for the development of woody plant cover, diversity will be limited in the early stages of succession. We recommend enrichment planting with species that would have been present before forest destruction but are not represented in the current seed rain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hydrological Properties of Litter in Different Vegetation Types: Implications for Ecosystem Functioning
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the hydrological properties of litter in different vegetation cover types, including Eucalyptus sp. plantation, Agroforestry, and Restoration Forest. The research focused on evaluating litter accumulation, composition, water holding capacity, and effective water retention. The results revealed variations in litter accumulation among the stands, and especially Eucalyptus sp., which had a higher proportion of branches compared to leaves. The water holding capacity of the litter differed among the stands. Agroforest and Restoration Forest showed higher litter water capacities than Eucalyptus sp. The composition and decomposition stage of the litter fractions influenced their water retention capabilities, with leaves exhibiting superior water retention. In contrast, branches had lower water absorption due to their hydrophobic nature. Despite these differences, the effective water retention, which indicates the ability of litter to intercept precipitation, was similar among the stands. The findings highlight the importance of considering litter composition and species-specific characteristics in understanding the hydrological functions of litter. This knowledge contributes to effective conservation and management strategies for sustainable land use practices and water resource management. Further research is recommended to expand the study's scope to include a wider range of forest types and natural field conditions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of litter hydrological functions and their implications for ecosystem processes.

TI  - Impact of population growth and housing development on the riverine environment: Identifying environmental threat and solution in the Wanggu River, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic growth in the nickel mining sector in Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, has accelerated development and population in Kendari City. The impact of increased immigration, transmigration, and urbanization increases the problem of deforestation to support the construction of people's homes in urban areas will result in damage to the ecosystem of the Wanggu River, Kendari City. This research uses geomorphology, demography, and ecology approaches to identify natural conditions with aerial photographs and satellite images (Google earth) simulated using ArcGis version 10.8. Then, it simulates the potential impact of flooding and pollution of the river environment due to the construction of people's houses around the riverside buffer. The study's findings reveal a discernible correlation between population growth and the heightened risk of ecological degradation within the river environment. The expansion of residential housing exerts significant stress on the river environment, resulting in the degradation of riparian areas and an increase in the river's pollution load. This deterioration in geomorphological, demographic, and ecological conditions within the river system has a direct and adverse impact on the overall health of the river ecosystem. Moreover, the results of the dynamics system simulation unequivocally indicate that river pollution is a persistent concern, with detrimental consequences extending to the mangrove area situated at the mouth of the Wanggu River, notably affecting pollution in Kendari Bay. The improvement of the built river area is useful for improving the landscape function of the river area, preventing erosion, and self-restoration of cities with rivers for ecological restoration, urban planning, and ecological management of urban landscapes in semi-arid areas with high rainfall intensity.

TI  - EVALUTION OF FOREST SPECIES IN AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS APPLIED TO RESTORATION OF DEGRADED AREAS AT OMBROPHYLOUS FOREST, PARATY, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of forest species in different agroforestry systems applied to restoration of degraded areas in Paraty-RJ. The agroforestry systems were established with leguminous and non-leguminous species in "single" (one plant/hole) and "married" (two plants/hole) planting. To do so, circumference at breast height, commercial height and total height of the individuals were measured after four years of the planting. The results showed the efficiency of the "married" planting in the agroforestry systems, despite of using leguminous or non-leguminous species, indicating the silvicultural potential for restoration of degraded areas.

TI  - Phylogenetic distance controls plant growth during early restoration of a semi-arid riparian forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little attention has been paid to phylogenetic diversity during restoration initiatives. Because plant phylogenetic distance can be a surrogate for functional diversity, its consideration could foster the restoration of degraded areas. This study investigates the influence of species richness and phylogenetic relatedness during early restoration of a riparian forest located between the Atlantic Forest and semi-arid ecosystems in NE Brazil. The restoration experiment was established along a perennial stream in Monte Alegre, RN, investigating the significance of species richness and phylogenetic diversity for sapling survival and growth of the restored communities. We used phylogenetic information on 47 tree species naturally occurring at the study site. The resulting phylogenetic tree had a basal node with three major clades. To implement the experiment, three species from each clade were randomly selected, resulting in nine species (from five families). We defined five levels of diversity: (i) no planting, (ii) monoculture, (iii) three phylogenetically related species (same clade), (iv) three phylogenetically distant species (different clades) and (v) nine species. The experiment consisted of 96 (12 m x 10 m) plots established along the two margins of the stream. Overall, 1656 saplings (20-50 cm) were planted in September 2015 (184 per species). We tested whether the survival and growth of saplings are influenced by the number of species planted and phylogenetic distance among them. We assessed plant mortality and growth during two consecutive years (2016 and 2017). Survival was lower but relative growth was higher for plants near the stream. After controlling for differences in initial size, plots with phylogenetically distant species produced significantly taller plants, but only when occurring near the stream. Diversity treatments did not influence plant survival, while initial size determined plant survival and growth. Our findings show that greater phylogenetic distance led to increased plant growth, probably, because of the presence of functionally divergent species that use resources in a complementary way. Therefore, plant phylogenetic relatedness should be considered during the design of restored communities to improve the outcomes of future restoration initiatives.

TI  - Mixing Green Manure With Native Seeds in the Same Row Enhances Species Establishment in Restoration Areas of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims This study investigates the effectiveness of different spatial arrangements of green manure and native species in promoting native seedling emergence and reducing invasive grass cover in restoration efforts, particularly within agricultural landscapes. Location Cerrado biome (savanna), Brazil. Methods We tested four experimental setups by direct seeding: (1) native species only (control), (2) native species and green manure mixed in the same row (N + GM [mixture]), (3) green manure and native species planted in separate rows (N + GM [rows]), and (4) native species intercropped with wider strips of green manure (N + GM [strips]). We evaluated richness, seedling abundance, invasive grass cover, and cost-effectiveness 540 days (a year and a half) post planting. Results The N + GM (mixture) treatment yielded the best cost-effectiveness, highest species richness (three species) and seedling abundance (10,267 individuals/ha), along with the lowest invasive grass cover (50%). Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne and Astronium fraxinifolium Schott ex Spreng had the highest emergence rates across all treatments. However, green manure alone did not entirely prevent invasive grass, requiring further weed control. N + GM (rows) showed the lowest cost, but should be considered only with ongoing maintenance. Conclusions Mixing green manure with native species in the same row (N + GM [mixture]) is a practical and cost-effective method for increasing native species emergence in the early stages of restoration, particularly in agricultural settings, where mechanized planting is feasible.

TI  - First assessment of soil mesofauna, microbiota, and humic substances associations in a minesoil revegetated with four grasses in Brazil: An 18-year field study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Moving away from coal protects our environment and soil. However, coal use in 2022 exceeded all previous years, systematically generating minesoils. The reestablishment of vegetation and organisms in minesoils is jeopardized by excessive soil compaction, eventual acidity, and depletion of soil organic matter (SOM), fauna, and microbial communities. Therefore, monitoring the recovery of soil attributes and functions as influenced by revegetation species is crucial to understanding the processes and time of ecological restoration. We aimed to verify if 18 years of revegetation with perennial grasses (Hemarthria altissima, Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon, Urochloa brizantha) transformed the minesoil a habitat for mites, springtails and other invertebrates as well as for soil microorganisms. Moreover, we investigated associations between these biological indicators with soil humic substances (HS) content. The minesoil is located in Candiota (Brazil), and was constructed in 2003, when revegetation with the grasses started. In 2021, soil samples (0.10 m depth) were collected to determine mites and springtails abundance, microbial respiration, carbon and metabolic quotient, soil, HS content, pH, bases, and aluminum saturation. In order to monitor the soil attributes recovery by the perennial grasses, the means of treatments were compared to the control using percentage differences (positive or negative), as the control was not part of the experimental design. The relationship between the biological variables and the soil variables was assessed using Spearman correlation, and the Canonical Correspondence Analysis was used to identify the performance of each grass in relation to the dataset. The associations observed confirm that the minesoil recovery process is still in its initial, mainly between soil biological functions with SOM humification. Positive associations occurred between mites and microbial respiration and accumulation of humin, especially with Urochloa brizantha revegetation.

AB  - Hylax bahiensis Bechyn, (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a new pest of forest species, including eucalyptus (hybrid Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis), Joannesia princeps, Mimosa artemisiana, Croton urucurana, Croton floribundus, and Senna multijuga is recorded. The insect attack in clonal eucalyptus plantations and in forest restoration areas between 2010 and 2013 in the states of Espirito Santo, Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brasil, was observed for the first time. The outbreaks generally occurred from September to March. This new potential pest can affect the growth, productivity, and quality of the trees. We recommended monitoring this leaf-eating beetle especially during the critical period of its occurrence.

TI  - Tree performance in a biodiversity enrichment experiment in an oil palm landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into oil palm monocultures has led to dramatic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. While ecological restoration is urgently needed in many oil palm landscapes, there is a lack of scientific knowledge of sustainable management strategies. We established experimental tree islands of varying sizes (25 m(2) to 1,600 m(2)) and diversity levels (1, 2, 3 and 6 species) in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. Six native multi-purpose tree species including Archidendron pauciflorum (Jengkol), Durio zibethinus (Durian), Parkia speciosa (Petai), Shorea leprosula (Meranti), Peronema canescens (Sungkai) and Dyera polyphylla (Jelutung) were planted between living and felled oil palms. Here, we analyse the controlling factors of tree growth and survival during the first 4 years at the level of local neighbourhood and tree island. We found a significant effect of diversity levels on tree productivity, that is, basal area was higher in multi-species than in single-species tree islands. This overyielding was attributed to enhanced tree growth, while mortality had no effect. In the local neighbourhood, tree species richness had a positive effect on tree growth during the first year only, indicating that selection and dominance of well-performing species at high level of diversity are most likely driving overyielding. Trees grew better away from living oil palms, suggesting tree-palm competition. Proximity to felled oil palms increased growth especially during the first years, during which the planted trees might have benefited from the additional available space and resources. Despite positive edge effects from the conventional oil palm management in the surrounding, tree island size had an overall positive effect on tree growth. Synthesis and applications. We planted native trees in an oil palm landscape following a tree island pattern. The establishment success differed widely among the six planted species. The selection of particular species is a decisive factor to foster a positive relationship between diversity and tree growth. Planting larger tree islands (e.g. 1,600 square metres) is a better option to enhance tree growth, but tree-palm competition implies a trade-off between tree growth and palm oil production in the tree islands.

TI  - Small-scale edaphic heterogeneity as a floristic-structural complexity driver in Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests tree communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our work aimed to test the hypothesis that soil microscale heterogeneity act as a community ecological driver, increasing diversity and promoting structural shifts on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) tree community. We evaluated the relationship between microscale edaphic variations and floristic-structural patterns of tree communities in a SDTF fragment located in the southern end of the Brazilian Caatinga domain. Vegetation and soil data were obtained through 27 sample units of 400 m(2)(20 m x 20 m), within each one we measured and identified at species level all arboreal individuals with Circumference at the Breast Height greater or equal to 10 cm, and also collected the soil samples. Through the data we evaluated soil variation influence on the tree community structural and floristic patterns trough generalized linear models. Soil explained the small-scale structural and floristic variations, contributing significantly to biomass, sprouting and to floristic relationships between sample units. It was also observed a possible relation of the result with the Caatinga domain biogeographic history, due the presence of Sedimentary Caatinga species, which are not expected for the study region. Soil plays an important role in driving small-scale complexity and diversity of SDTF, but we also suggest that Caatinga biogeographic events have influence on the high heterogeneity patterns.

TI  - Edible and medicinal native plants: non-timber forest products and sustainable exploitation potential
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to identify native species that produce non-timber forest resources, aiming at their management and exploration in different productive systems, possibly contributing to income generation for small landowners as well as the maintenance of forest areas. The research was developed in the Environmental Protection Area -APA Tejupa, Corumbatai and Botucatu (SP, Brazil), where Mata Atlantica and Cerrado biomes occur. Based on the list of native species in the APA management plan, we identified those cited in the literature for their use as medicinal and food. To evaluate these species, those of interest for the public policies of the Brazilian government were selected, since they have already commercial potential. Finally, these species of interest were evaluated based on the parameters of sustainable use, to evaluate if their sustainable management is possible. Of the total of 735 species identified, 329 are edible plant and have medicinal uses. 219 of them are medicinal and 110 can be used as food. In addition, 68% of these species are trees, demonstrating the high diversity of species that could be used in forest restoration projects and agroforestry systems. However, of the total number of plant species detected, only 22 are included in public policies, and only 6 species have sufficient studies for sustainable exploitation in the studied region. Research and Public policies aimed at the management and use of native species should be reinforced, aiming to increase the set of species that can be used and provide benefits to the owners, in addition to ecological sustainability.

AB  - Forest restoration is aimed at conserving the fauna, flora, and their interactions. Therefore, restoration projects must be frequently controlled and evaluated. Structural patterns are used to evaluate these projects, but functional patterns must also be considered. Information about phenology is scarce and it is related to functional patterns, therefore the aim of this study was to verify the flowering phenology of eight woody species in an area that has been subjected to restoration for three years at Centro de Ciencias Agrarias da Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo. Activity and intensity indices were used to infer the occurrence and availability of flowers. All individuals of seven planted species and 18 individuals of a regenerating species were observed from January to December 2011. Among the planted species, the flowering period with greater intensity and synchronization was from January to March, the warmest and wettest period of the year. In cold and dry months, Solanum lycocarpum was important for maintaining flowers in the area. We conclude that a greater diversity of woody species flowering throughout the year is necessary to provide floral resources for floral visitors continuously.

TI  - Comparing different densities of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) for restoration of forest reserves in Pontal do Paranapanema, SP
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing reductions of tropical forests, especially in the Mata Atlantica bioma, have led to serious environmental consequences. However, there is a great need for new restoration models in tropical forestry. The aim of this work was to evaluate alternatives to accelerate restoration and decrease costs for such restoration. Pigeon pea may help ecological restoration. The main hypothesis was that different densities of Cajanus cajan can promote ecological restoration. Cajanus cajan was interplanted with native trees in a 2 x 4 m spacing. After 22 and 34 months of planting, four different treatments were evaluated. The treatments were: no guandu between tree lines; two seeds between tree lines; elimination of the one guandu plant after six months of planting and complete elimination of the two guandu plants after six months of planting. For data collection 100 trees were chosen by chance in each treatment. The results showed an increase in height where Cajanus cajan was present. 34 months after planting the total basal area of native trees planted close to two pigeon pea plants were significantly smaller when compared to those planted close to one pigeon pea per tree. The mortality of pioneer species without pigeon pea was significantly superior to the mortality of non-pioneer species in the same condition. The soil structure around Cajanus cajan showed a larger content of organic matter and less phosphorus, when compared to the testimony treatment. This study suggests negative and positive effects for the intercropping of Cajanus cajan and the native trees; therefore the first hypothesis is refuted and the second hypothesis is not.

TI  - Natural regeneration in a degraded tropical peatland, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia: Implications for forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation, yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas previously cleared for agriculture have been abandoned, there is little evidence of subsequent forest recovery. We assessed the composition of non-forest regrowth in a degraded peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: a failed attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Regrowth was assessed in 223 20 m x 20 m plots distributed at 100 m intervals along transects through the deforested area. Individual woody plants >= 0.5 m in height were counted and identified. A total of 6085 woody plants 0.5-3 m high and 2720 woody plants >3 m were counted from 79 morphospecies. The mean density of woody plants was 0.09 individuals m(-2), with a range of 0.005-0.53 individuals m(-2) across plots. Most woody species also grew in mature forest, but regrowth was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly Combretocarpus rotundatus) and most other species were potentially dispersed by bulbuls (Pycnonotidae) and other small- to medium-sized birds. Most regeneration reflects the availability of dispersal agents, with additional woody species probably sprouting from vegetative remnants of the previous forest cover, although a role for additional dispersal agents cannot be ruled out. Ground cover was dominated by fern species not typically found in mature forest and may be inhibiting woody plant regrowth. Continuous woody canopy cover is probably achievable by unassisted regeneration in degraded peatlands, but it will be slow and patchy with low species diversity. We recommend enrichment planting with species from intact peat swamp forest, but only after an initial survey of the existing regrowth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of logging on the biodiversity and composition of flora and fauna in the mangrove forests of Bintuni Bay, West Papua, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem of Bintuni Bay, West Papua, Indonesia is one of the largest in the world covering more than 250,000 ha. In the southern part of the bay, ? 82,120 ha of mangroves and surrounding area is managed and harvested under a 30-year rotation cycle to produce wood chips, with strict compliance to sustainable forest management standards. Flora and fauna have been continuously monitored for a period of 10 years (2009?2018), to assess the effectiveness of environmental management programs on the biological aspect. Mangrove flora and fauna recorded in the area comprise 28 true mangrove species representing 11 families along with 103 birds (40 families), 9 reptiles (6 families) and 7 mammals (5 families). Results confirm previous studies that secondary mangrove forest shows significant growth and recovery, with 5 true mangrove species consistently becoming dominant species in primary and secondary mangrove forest. Logging on mangroves significantly impacted the biodiversity of flora as Rhizopora apiculata become more dominant in secondary forest covering 69% of total species composition. Abundance and diversity of fauna in secondary forest was higher in younger forests as compared to older stands. About 18% of total fauna individual was categorized as keystone species. Fauna composition was not significantly impacted by logging most likely due to the abundance of habitat (untouched forest) remaining in the surrounding harvest area. With appropriate environmental management programs, impact of logging on mangrove forest can be minimized and the ecosystem could be restored effectively to provide adequate habitat for flora and fauna.

TI  - Coral reef restoration in Indonesia: lessons learnt from the world's largest coral restoration nation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesia is the global coral reef restoration leader by number of projects, yet these remain diverse and disparate. This study reviews the status of Indonesian coral reef restoration within a framework of international common best practice (CBP) that incorporates internationally-recognised Standards for Ecological Restoration (SER). This framework is used to formulate recommendations for a formal network of reef restoration practitioners with the purview to develop and implement a national restoration roadmap. Forty-five projects were surveyed to determine how projects have been planned and implemented. This was compared with recommendations from CBP. There is particular scope to increase quantitative data collection, reinforce community involvement, improve ecological data collection, and standardise monitoring protocols. While 84% of projects reported quantifiable goals, 64% did not quantify goals during planning and 61% did not incorporate climate-smart design features. Quantitative reef monitoring surveys were absent in 22% of projects. The majority of projects did not quantify important ecological metrics like coral community composition/diversity (96%), coral health/bleaching (89%), benthic community (62%), and coral survival (62%). Indonesia has the capacity, regulations, and networks to position itself as a reef restoration driver in the Coral Triangle region; this will require increased coordination, alignment, and quantification of restoration. A structured, collaborative, and iterative national network of various stakeholders would facilitate the development of a national restoration roadmap based on adaptive management strategies. This would aid in standardising project planning, monitoring, and reporting. Efforts should include an increased focus on climate change adaptation goals.

TI  - Liana functional assembly along the hydrological gradient in Central Amazonia
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil hydrology, nutrient availability, and forest disturbance determine the variation of tropical tree species composition locally. However, most habitat filtering is explained by tree species' hydraulic traits along the hydrological gradient. We asked whether these patterns apply to lianas. At the community level, we investigated whether hydrological gradient, soil fertility, and forest disturbance explain liana species composition and whether liana species-environment relationships are mediated by leaf and stem wood functional traits. We sampled liana species composition in 18 1-ha plots across a 64 km(2) landscape in Central Amazonia and measured eleven leaf and stem wood traits across 115 liana species in 2000 individuals. We correlated liana species composition, summarized using PCoA with the functional composition summarized using principal coordinate analysis (PCA), employing species mean values of traits at the plot level. We tested the relationship between ordination axes and environmental gradients. Liana species composition was highly correlated with functional composition. Taxonomic (PCoA) and functional (PCA) compositions were strongly associated with the hydrological gradient, with a slight influence from forest disturbance on functional composition. Species in valley areas had larger stomata size and higher proportions of self-supporting xylem than in plateaus. Liana species on plateaus invest more in fast-growing leaves (higher SLA), although they show a higher wood density. Our study reveals that lianas use different functional solutions in dealing with each end of the hydrological gradient and that the relationships among habitat preferences and traits explain lianas species distributions less directly than previously found in trees.

TI  - CONTRIBUTION OF LITTER FALL IN FOREST RECOVERY PLANTATION UNDER DIFFERENT PLANTING SPACINGS
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the deposition of litter, during one year period, in forest restoration plantation, deployed at different spacings. The planting took place in November 2004, at the Thermoelectric Plant 'Barbosa Lima Sobrinho', in Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro state. In December 2007, nine circular collectors were installed, tied to trees with nylon, in the four studied spacings: 1 x 1 m; 1.5 x 1.5 m; 2 x 2 m; and 3 x 2 m. The collections were done monthly, until December 2008. The material was taken to the laboratory, separated into leaves, branches, reproductive and miscellaneous and after being dried in stove at 65 degrees C for 48 hours, it was weighed. The values found for the total deposition of litter were, from the more to the less dense spacing: 6.93; 4.48; 5.12; and 3.71 Mg ha(-1). The spacing which produced a greater quantity of litter was the 1 x 1 m. The litter deposition was higher in the dry season. The seasonal pattern was similar in the different spacings. The leaf fraction was predominant in all the spacings. The litter deposition, in general, was positively correlated with canopy cover index and was not correlated with the basal area of the stand. The obtained values of the litter production in this study can be considered similar to those found in secondary forest near the study area.

TI  - How do management alternatives of fast-growing forests affect water quantity and quality in southeastern Brazil? Insights from a paired catchment experiment
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast-growing forest plantations have been expanding in Brazil in the last 50 years, which reach productivities by over 40 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) in reduced rotation between 5 and 15 years. In the 1990s, environmental warnings about these plantations guided research projects seeking to understand their effects on water and propose forest management actions to minimize them. The assessment of forest management effects on water resources is conducted by long-term experiments in paired catchments. In this paper we present results of some studies conducted at the hydrological monitoring centre of Itatinga Experimental Forest Station, of the University of Sao Paulo, where hydrological monitoring began in 1987, and currently include three catchments (83-98 ha) under different forest management regimes: short-rotation Eucalyptus plantation, long-term forest plantation mosaic and native forest restoration. Results show that at similar conditions observed at study area including deep soils and good natural water regulation, hydrological effects vary according to the forest management regime adopted, increasing water consumption and making the flow regime vulnerable to intra- and inter-annual seasonality. Regarding water quality, weekly sampling results showed suspended sediments and nitrate concentrations below water quality thresholds criteria by silvicultural operations, and the effects were transient but higher concentrations of nutrients were observed in intensive management regime. In the study area, reducing the management intensity of forest plantation by increasing the rotation time, adopting forest age mosaic and avoiding the coppice technique are alternative choices that reduced water use and increased flow regulation. Different adopted forest management schemes directly affected water use, showing that in water-deficit tropical regions, management regime of fast-growing forest plantations controls water availability.

TI  - Bee and plant traits drive temporal similarity of pollination interactions in areas under distinct restoration strategies
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the ways to evaluate the success of restoration strategies in degraded areas, in terms of restoring pollination, key process for the reproduction of most angiosperm species, is evaluating species traits, how they respond to changes in the environment and influence their interacting partners. In this study we asked: (i) does the phenological variation, the restoration strategy and the restoration age influence species richness, abundance, species composition and distribution of traits of bees and plants? (ii) do functionally similar species tend to interact with the same mutualistic partners? (iii) what are the most important traits that explain the similarity of interacting partners? We analyzed bee and plant communities in restored areas in the Atlantic Forest. We found that bee richness and abundance did not vary, and plant richness varied temporally. Bee and plant composition changed over time and among restoration strategies. Plant composition also varied with the restoration age. Functional composition, especially of bees, varied little among the tested factors. We also found that species with similar traits tended to interact with similar partners, and bee size, proboscis length and nesting sites were the most important traits to explain the interactions, while for plants, the most important traits were form of life, corolla color and shape. Our study demonstrated that interactions between bees and plants can be mediated by plant phenology and, considering that plant traits filter pollinators' traits, the choice of plant traits in restoration areas is fundamental for interactions.

TI  - Restoring understory and riparian areas in oil palm plantations does not increase greenhouse gas fluxes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm (OP) plantations have replaced large areas of forest in the tropical landscape of Southeast Asia and are major emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs). To move towards more environmentally friendly plantation management, a hopeful approach is to implement strategies to increase vegetation complexity. These options include relaxed management of understory vegetation to increase complexity in productive plantations, passive restoration of forest areas around rivers by leaving mature oil palm during replanting, and active forest restoration along river margins with planting of forest trees. These practices have the potential to deliver a range of benefits such as soil protection, reduced erosion and sedimentation in rivers, pest control and support for biodiversity, but little is known about their impact on greenhouse gas fluxes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of improved understory growth management and the use of riparian forestry on GHG fluxes in OP plantations, making use of two long-term experiments (the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture Understory Vegetation (BEFTA UV) Project; the Riparian Ecosystem Restoration in Tropical Agriculture (RERTA) Project) in Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ecosystem respiration (CO2) from mature OP sites with different levels of understory vegetation and different riparian buffer restoration treatments using the static chamber method. We used linear mixed effects models to test for treatment effects, whilst accounting for soil moisture and experimental design factors (time and space). The understory vegetation treatments (normal, reduced and enhanced complexity of understory) had no effect on N2O and CH4 flux. Regarding differences in ecosystem respiration, effects attributable to the understory vegetation treatments were not strong. For the riparian restoration treatments, the fixed effects variables in the models explained little variation in the fluxes of all GHGs. Therefore, given the proven benefits of more complex understory vegetation for supporting biodiversity and healthy ecosystem functioning, plus the potential for restored riparian buffers to support biodiversity and services and to reduce GHG emissions over time, our findings reinforce the concept that these features bring environmental benefits in OP landscapes, with no measurable effects on GHG emissions.

TI  - Runoff, soil loss, and water balance in a restored Karst area of the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although data exist about the impact of karst soil restoration in some regions and climates, this information is lacking in the sub-humid Brazilian savannah. Runoff plots with distinct soil covers (bare soil, and ecologically restored areas with native species) were installed over a Lithic entisol on a karst slope of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), where runoff, erosion, and soil water balance were monitored during 3 hydrologic years. Mean runoff and erosion in the ecologically restored areas decreased from 546 mm yr- 1 to 360 mm yr- 1, and from 34 Mg ha 1yr-1 to 5 Mg ha1yr-1, respectively. Soil loss tolerance was exceeded the bare plot of the Lithic entisol in all three hydrologic years. In the third year, erosion fell below soil loss tolerance in the restored plots, indicating that soil degradation could be effectively reduced with ecological restoration. The runoff and erosion data of the present study was fitted by an exponential relationship developed for non-karst soils of the Cerrado. Soil water balance was improved in the restored plots, increasing infiltration and evapotranspiration, and reducing runoff. The results fill an important information gap in tropical karst science, and could be utilized in similar settings.

TI  - Coupling remote sensing and eDNA to monitor environmental impact: A pilot to quantify the environmental benefits of sustainable agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring is essential to ensure that environmental goals are being achieved, including those of sustainable agriculture. Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificacao Florestal e Agricola (IMAFLORA) near Sao Felix do Xingu, in Para, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called TerraBio. Our results suggest that, due to IMAFLORA's shaded cocoa projects, over 400 acres were restored in the intervention area and the community composition of arthropods in shaded cocoa is closer to second-growth forests than that of pastures. In reviewing the coupled approach, we found multiple aspects worked well, and we conclude by presenting multiple lessons learned.

TI  - Evaluation of the Phytotoxicity of Urochloa humidicola Roots by Bioassays and Microscopic Analysis. Characterization of New Compounds
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbicides are a key element in agriculture but they do cause environmental problems and natural alternatives are being sought. In this context, invasive plants could provide an as yet unexplored source for the development of future herbicides. Urochloa humidicola has great invasive potential in Brazilian environments as it hampers the establishment of other plants. The phytotoxicity of U. humidicola root extracts has been evaluated, and the major components have been identified. The phytotoxicity of the extract was assessed in the wheat coleoptile assay on seeds of troublesome weeds and on Anadenanthera colubrina, a tree species used in ecological restoration programs. The ethyl acetate extract showed the highest activity, and the most affected weeds were E. crus-galli, M. maximus, and A. viridis with the latter weed more affected by the extract than by the herbicide Logran. Microscopic ultrastructural analysis of A. colubrina roots indicated possible signals of cell death. Seven compounds were identified in the ethyl acetate extract of which one diterpene and four saponins are new. Six of these compounds were tested in the wheat coleoptile bioassay. The most active were diterpene 1 and saponins 2, 3, and 6. The phytotoxic activity of U. humidicola explains the issues observed in ecological restoration with A. colubrina in the presence of Urochloa species, and its effect on weeds reinforces its potential use in agriculture.

TI  - Biomass Equations and Carbon Stock Estimates for the Southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change, emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales. This is essential for effective carbon management, which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation. However, reliable sample-based estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations, which are lacking for the rainforests of the Atlantic Forest Domain (AFD). In this study, we fitted biomass equations for the three main AFD forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their above-ground biomass (AGB) in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Using non-destructive methods, we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest, semideciduous forest, and restinga forest in the state. The biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with tree-level data from 185 plots obtained in the National Forest Inventory conducted in Rio de Janeiro. Our locally developed allometric equations estimated the state's biomass stocks at 70.8 +/- 5.4 Mg ha-1 and carbon stocks at 35.4 +/- 2.7 Mg ha-1. Notably, our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature, which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks. These findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest, especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market, which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations.

TI  - Indigenous territories and governance of forest restoration in the Xingu River (Brazil)
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the early 2000s, indigenous and non-indigenous peoples inhabiting the headwaters of the Xingu River (Mato Grosso state, Brazil) engaged in a collective decision to undertake the `Y Ikatu Xingu Campaign, a social phenomenon and forum for the restoration and protection of Xingu?s headwaters and riparian forests?a commonpool resources shared by indigenous, farmers, and urban populations in the region. These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. In order to reverse the damaging trends of the future of the Xingu River and promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests, and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the ?Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources ? Xingu?s headwaters, riparian forests and rivers?and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed.. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas, and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures. We showed that indigenous people have a fundamental role in questioning and advancing the outcomes of restoration efforts, and monitoring environmental impact on water quality of rivers, as well as on conditions of forests and other ecosystems surrounding indigenous lands. We discuss the perspectives of K?se?dje? indigenous inhabitants of the environmental governance related to restoration efforts and monitoring, and their concerns with a dynamic scenario of agribusiness expansion in the Xingu River Headwaters region.

TI  - Effects of climate and land-use on physicochemical properties of gneiss-derived soils in tropical drylands: Evidence from northeastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gneisses are rocks formed by metamorphism and their resistance to weathering plays an important role in the physical and chemical properties of soils in tropical drylands. In this study, we evaluated the effects of climate including semi-arid, dry sub-humid, wet sub-humid, and humid, and land-use encompassing forest restoration, agriculture, and pasture and their interactions on the physical and chemical properties of the surface horizon of fifty-five soil profiles originating from gneiss saprolite in the tropical drylands of northeastern Brazil. Our results have shown that climatic extremes such as semi-arid and humid climates contributed to the formation of soils with low nutrient availability, notably Ca2+ (2.1-3.4 cmolc kg- 1), Mg2+ (1.4-1.5 cmolc kg- 1) and P (3.5-6.3 mg kg- 1). In general, the drier ecosystems presented, on average, 63.5% and 51.7% less C and N, respectively, than wetter ecosystems. In contrast, soils in a more humid climate had, on average, 56.0% and 39.6% more silt and clay, respectively, than those in the semi-arid climate. The land-use analysis indicated that soils under pasture had, on average, 32.2%, 24.2%, 66.6%, 40.4%, and 35.8% less Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, C, and N, respectively, than soils under agricultural cultivation. Overall, both agriculture (4.8 mg P kg- 1) and pasture (5.0 mg P kg- 1) on average, reduced the available P content of soils by 75% when compared to soils under forest (19.7 mg P kg- 1). The interaction between climate and land-use indicated that regardless of the climatic conditions, pastures intensified soil degradation, showing a reduced correlation with properties related to soil fertility. For all climatic conditions, extensive pastures should be carried out considering the animal stocking rate supported by natural vegetation to reduce the risk of environmental degradation. We concluded that the interaction between a semiarid climate and extensive pasture represents the condition of the highest level of degradation in the physicochemical properties of gneiss-derived soils in tropical drylands.

TI  - The role of plant diversity and facilitation during tropical dry forest restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration programmes that promote the functioning of restored ecosystems are in urgent demand. Although several biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments have demonstrated the importance of functional complementarity in enhancing plant community performance, no biodiversity experiment has yet manipulated facilitation to test its contribution to how the complementarity effect (CE) modulates community performance.We built a restoration experiment manipulating diversity and facilitation potential in a tropical semi-arid forest. We planted 4704 seedlings of 16 native tree species to assemble 147 experimental communities with 45 different compositions comprising 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species. Facilitation potential was included in the experimental design by creating a gradient of communities from low to high facilitation potential (based on prior research). We measured functional dispersion and functional identity using species above- and below-ground traits to investigate how they modulate the effects of species diversity and facilitation potential on leaf biomass production, using the additive partition biodiversity effects CE and selection effect (SE).The joint influence of diversity and facilitation potential was tested separately for leaf biomass production and net biodiversity effect using linear mixed models (LMMs). We subsequently ran LMMs including functional dispersion and functional identity. We hypothesised that facilitation potential would increase community productivity and functioning and that functional dispersion and functional identity related to above- and below-ground traits would explain facilitation performance.Facilitation potential positively influenced leaf biomass production as predicted, but unexpectedly, neither of the functional traits were important for modulating the facilitation process. Positive values for CE showed that plants performed better in mixtures in comparison to monocultures. SE negative values, showed that species with below average performance in monocultures, performed better in mixtures. Unexpectedly, CE did not increase as species diversity or facilitation potential increased. The SE was influenced negatively by facilitation potential leading to a more equal distribution of biomass production between species in mixtures.Synthesis. Facilitation improves biomass production in restored communities and increases biomass equitability among plant species and thus ecosystem reliability. To improve restoration success, plant communities should be built using a combination of facilitative species.

TI  - Relief determines patterns of structure and composition of tree vegetation in seasonal forests in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - We sought to understand how relief features act as environmental filters, altering the floristic and structural patterns of tropical seasonal forests. To this end, we raised the following question: how can relief characteristics influence the structure and species composition of seasonal forest fragments? We aimed to assess how the functional characteristics (height and basal area), structural characteristics (density) and composition of tree species can vary according to the relief. Samplings were performed in the Serra da Bodoquena National Park (SBNP), Cerrado biome, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We selected ten sampling areas at different altitudes (173-549 m) and geomorphological features. In each area we sampled the trees using the Point Center Quarter method. We established 20 quarter points in each area, with a minimum distance of 15 m between points, totaling a 300 m line. In each quadrant, we recorded the nearest tree and its distance to the center, basal area, and height. From these data, we calculated diversity, importance value and species richness in each sampled area and the phytosociological variables (density, frequency, abundance, and species composition) and used generalized linear models to relate these variables with geomorphological data. We recorded 117 taxa, Fabaceae being the most representative family (21 species), and the species with the highest importance value were Urera caracasana (IV = 30.97), Anadenanthera colubrina (IV = 28.5) and Plenadenophora membranifolia (IV = 26.25). We observed increased tree height and basal area with increased altitude and a reduction in tree density according to increased declivity. Species composition also varied with altitude and legumes were less frequent in lower and plane areas. The variation of altitude and declivity of the terrain alters structural patterns and species composition of seasonal forests. We emphasize that species with high importance value can be recommended in ecological restoration programs of forest fragments.

TI  - Restoration of degraded areas after bauxite mining in the eastern Amazon: Which method to apply?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon has one of the largest bauxite reserves in the world and the growing demand for this ore intensifies environmental impacts and, consequently, the necessity of ecosystems restoration. In this sense, the monitoring of indicators is essential to ensure the restoration success. The objective of this study was to evaluate indicators of ecosystem restoration in areas degraded by bauxite mining in the eastern Amazon, Brazil, under three different restoration methods: Nucleation (NC), Seedling planting (SP), and induction of natural regeneration (NR) in comparison with a reference forest (RF). Structural and compositional indicators, including density, frequency, and dominance, as well as the Importance Value Index (IVI) of tree species, mortality, conservation status, diversity indices, and Mean Annual Increase in height and diameter (MAIH and MAIDBH) were assessed. Solanum crinitum, Cecropia distachya, Senegalia polyphylla, and Qualea grandiflora were the most important species according to IVI for SP, NR, NC, and RF, respectively. In SP, MAIH and MAIDBH were higher than in the other treatments, however, the difference between methods was not of significant. The diversity indices of the three restoration methods tested were close to those of RF. Four species with some conservation status were identified; Cedrela odorata, Genipa americana, Swietenia macrophylla, and Hymenaea parvifolia, all native to the eastern Amazon. Thus, through the indicators, we found that all restoration methods showed positive indicators of restoration and a gradual return of the structural characteristics of the vegetation.

TI  - The conservation value of forest fragments in a coastal "Restinga" forest in southeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Restinga forests are one of the most threatened coastal ecosystems associated with the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. As there have been very few studies of the regeneration of those forest remnants, and their many different regeneration times, we examined the composition and structure of species in both conserved and disturbed Restinga forest sites within a conservation area on the eastern coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Surveys of shrub/tree species were undertaken in 80 plots (25 m(2)) in which all woody plants were tagged, identified, measured (diameter and height), and their regrowth capacity (from roots and/or stems) evaluated. We classified the species according to their growth habits and dispersal syndromes. Comparisons of the conserved and disturbed areas were made based on phytosociological parameters. We encountered 104 species occurring exclusively in the conserved area and 45 species occurring exclusively in the disturbed area. Only thirteen species were shared by both areas (low floristic similarity), although those showed divergent tree canopy growth parameters. We identified strong differences in the floristic and structural components of disturbed and conserved areas, indicating the high conservation relevance of the latter. Our results evidence the low resilience to disturbance of Restinga forests, even considering the contiguity between conserved and disturbed areas. Species common to both areas evidenced diverse functional traits (fast-growing, zoochorous, resprouters, N-2-fixing traits) valuable to ecological restoration activities. These findings may assist policymakers in developing efficient restoration and conservation strategies for this forest type.

TI  - REFERENCE ECOSYSTEMS FOR RIPARIAN FOREST RESTORATION: ARE THERE ANY PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY, FOREST STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS?
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of natural ecosystems as a goal to be achieved and the selection of indicators to evaluate restoration success are controversial issues in both Science and practice of ecosystem restoration. Four remnants of riparian vegetation were assessed in the region of Seasonally Semideciduous Forest in order to verify if some attributes of this plant community varied among sites and if they could be used as reference for this region. Ten plots of 100 m(2) were established in each site and woody plants with height >= 50 cm, separated in upper stratum (dbh >= 5 cm) and lower stratum (dbh < 5 cm), and classified by functional traits, rarity and status in red lists. Terrestrial ferns, lianas and trees with epiphytes were all accounted. Density (in both layers, and trees with epiphythes), basal area, and canopy cover did not differ among areas. Rarefied richness and total estimated richness, as well as the proportion of species by dispersal syndrome, shade tolerance, growth rhythm, and rarity follow a regional pattern, which can be considered as reference for riparian forests in this ecological region. Whether or not these values can be used as restoration goals depends on: 1) long term assessment of restoration success, and 2) scientific evidence that restored ecosystems can reach such values.

TI  - Green manure cover effects on restoration success in Southeast Atlantic Forest biome
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Active restoration techniques, such as direct sowing, is an important strategy to benefit forest structure formation and to inhibit the exotic grasses invasion, which is an impediment to many restoration projects. The use of green manure in sowing can improve soil cover conditions and inhibit grasses. Thus, in this study we aimed to investigate the role of green manure canopy on invasive grass species??? cover and on growing of native species seedlings in direct sowing sites in the Southeast Atlantic Forest biome. We hypothesized that green manure would suppress the cover of exotic grasses and would benefit native species??? seedling growth. The study monitored six plots of 25 m x 4 m in a restored area (by direct sowing in pits) belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome, located in Cruzeiro municipality, in February 2021, June 2021 and January 2022. Measurements of individuals were the circumference at breast height and the plant height. We also inventoried per pit: canopy diameter, canopy cover and invasive grass cover. We found that a higher green manure canopy cover (regarding plant size and canopy) was responsible for decreasing invasive grass species cover, namely Brachiaria species. In addition, some species had higher canopy cover that suppressed invasive grasses more efficiently. We did not find a positive effect of green manure on native species seedling growth. However, the change from dry season to wet season in canopy cover, together with invasive grasses presence, negatively affected the growth of native species seedlings. These results provide important guidelines and indicate the role of the direct sowing technique for decreasing exotic grasses invasion and the establishment of native species.

TI  - Selection of Genipa americana L. seed trees by genetic divergence in fruit, seeds, and seedlings
T2  - GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of the source's genetic characteristics and their use in restoration projects is essential to maintaining restoration survival, mainly in tropical forests. Considering that genetics should be examined in forest restoration projects, analyses with phenotypic characters are more practical to implement in forest nurseries. Genipa americana L. is an essential species in producing seedlings for restoration purposes. This study aimed to select G. americana seed trees for seed collection in an area of the Atlantic Forest through the genetic divergence study in fruit, seeds, and seedlings. The study was conducted in the Saltinho Biological Reserve in Tamandare - PE, Brazil. The ripe fruit of 11 G. americana seed trees were collected. The physical and physicochemical characterization of the fruit, biometric characterization of the seeds, and seed emergence analysis were performed. The Selegen REML/BLUP software, model 81, was used for genetic analyses, and the cluster analysis was performed by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method. A seed tree selection index was also used. The effects of the seed tree determination coefficients were low because there was considerable interaction between the sites where each one was inserted. It is possible to state that each variable contributes to explaining the genetic dissimilarity between the seed trees. Seed trees 1, 4, and 6 had the best average ranks for most of the variables analyzed concerning genotypes. The Saltinho Biological Reserve proved to be a good source of genetic and reproductive material for the species G. americana for forest restoration purposes.

TI  - Analysis of forest fragmentation in the Atlantic forest of Sergipe, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the forest cover of Sergipe's Atlantic Forest from 2001 to 2021 using landscape ecology indices. To do this, the forest fragments from 2001 and 2021 were mapped using images obtained from the Mapbiomas 7.0 project. Landscape metrics were calculated using Patch Analyst (ArcGis 9.3). The results show that the forest formation (FF) and mangrove (MA) classes increased forest cover, large fragments and fragment connectivity. These two classes are largely located in protected areas or Permanent Preservation Areas. The savannah formation (FS) and grassland formation (FC) classes showed degradation from 2001 to 2021, with loss of area, fragmentation of large fragments into smaller ones, greater isolation and edge effect with loss of central area. Deforestation in these classes may result from the flat relief, open canopy, and stratum, which are grassy plants with a good aptitude for agriculture. However, the proposed forest restoration programs in FC and FS presents a significant opportunity for positive change, inspiring us to work towards a more sustainable future.

TI  - DEFINING AND TESTING TARGETS FOR THE RECOVERY OF TROPICAL STREAMS BASED ON MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES AND ABIOTIC CONDITIONS
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we set target values to measure the ecological improvement of streams, based on invertebrate communities, riparian vegetation, instream habitat conditions and water chemistry. The study area is a large tropical catchment (Rio das Velhas, Minas Gerais, Brazil) affected by pastures, mining areas and a large urbanized area but also includes natural protected areas. Two stream types were found in the catchment, based on stream size, elevation, climate and geology with significantly different macroinvertebrate communities. In spite of a marked wet/dry seasons' climatic pattern, that does not result in the segregation of communities. Four classes of global degradation (IVbad to Igood condition) were defined based on the available abiotic information, corresponding to a gradient in structure and biotic metrics of macroinvertebrate communities, matching the current knowledge on taxa sensitivity to pollution and general disturbance. Class I corresponds to target conditions to be achieved under restoration programmes. Using this approach, we were able to detect an improvement of abiotic conditions in four urban streams that benefited from enhancement measures in 2007-2008. However, invertebrate communities improved clearly in only one site (biotic metrics and community structure). Our study highlighted that good water quality alone is not enough and that only the combined effect of water quality, riparian vegetation and instream habitat condition enhancement resulted in the improvement of invertebrate communities. An important limiting factor for macroinvertebrate communities' recovery may be the distance to source populations. We concluded that the combined use of biological and abiotic target values for measuring the recovery of streams is needed to fully achieve an ecological restoration. This approach can also be valuable in the regular monitoring of streams to assess stream degradation. Target values based on other biological elements, such as fishes and algae, and functional processes could also contribute to define more global and realistic goals.

TI  - Management of ecological filters for increasing the native vegetation cover in a mine treated with sewage sludge in the Cerrado Biome
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The dominance of invasive species and the compaction of mine surfaces are ecological filters that usually restrict the establishment and growth of native plant species. The understanding of ecological filter mechanisms aiming to overcome their effects on the ecological succession is crucial for the ecological restoration of ecosystems. In order to evaluate the effects of reducing the intensity of the surface compaction and the grass dominance on the plant recruitment, we set up 24 experimental plots at six repetitions in a mine dominated by Urochloa brizantha. Treatments consisted in control (T1), herbicide application on U. brizantha (T2), mechanized plowing to ameliorate surface compaction (T3), and the combination of T2 and T3 (T4). Results showed that the chemical attenuation of U. brizantha dominance and surface decompaction allowed the recruitment of 29 plant species, 66% of which are invasive species, exotic to the Cerrado biome. However, the treatments T2, T3, and T4 resulted in the formation of richer and more diverse plant communities in comparison to the plots used as control (T1). U. brizantha cover redeveloped after both surface unpacking and herbicide application, but the plant species that recruited on U. brizantha cover in the meantime improved the ecological condition in experimental plots.

TI  - Development of microsatellite primers for Senna multijuga (Fabaceae): a pioneer species from the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration activities of degraded tropical forest areas require tree species that can develop in harsh environments and facilitate the ecologic successional process. Here, we report the development and polymorphism of eleven microsatellite markers for Senna multijuga (Fabaceae), a pioneer tropical tree species and important food resource for local wildlife that occurs mainly in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Thirty-six individuals were collected in an abandoned cacao plantation and in pasture to characterize the developed primers. All eleven primers were polymorphic. On average, the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.146 to 0.858 and an excess of heterozygotes were observed. The combined probability of exclusion was higher than 0.999, indicating that the microsatellite markers developed are suitable for genetic structure investigations and parentage analyses. Our results will contribute with the conservation genetics of the species to fulfill its role in restoring degraded tropical forest areas and proving precious resources to the local wildlife.

TI  - Achieving private conservation targets in Brazil through restoration and compensation schemes without impairing productive lands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental policies that require native vegetation conservation can be challenging to implement, especially in productive agricultural landscapes. In Brazil, the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law mandates 'Legal Reserves', protected native vegetation that landowners must retain on their properties. If landowners do not have the required minimum amount of native vegetation on their properties (the Legal Reserve 'target'), they must either restore vegetation on the same property to meet the target, or compensate by protecting existing vegetation or restoring it on another property, ideally in ecologically equivalent areas. Here, we evaluate how different strategies (on-site/off-site protection and/or restoration), and different requirements for ecological equivalence when off-site strategies are used, affect the ability to achieve Legal Reserve targets, while minimising the need to restore native vegetation on productive farmland. We used a novel iterative tool to build scenarios that reflect different combinations of strategies to meet the minimum conservation target under different requirements for ecological equivalence, and compared their ability to achieve the target and their likely cost. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome where it was not possible to achieve the Legal Reserve target by protection of existing native vegetation, even when ecological equivalence rules were relaxed. As a consequence, vegetation restoration is required in this biome. Directing this required restoration to pasturelands that are less-suitable for agriculture allowed the target to be achieved in all states of Brazil, as long as only minimal ecological equivalence was required; however, for most states, the need to restore native vegetation on productive areas on farmlands could still be avoided while requiring medium to high ecological equivalence. These findings show the potential for moderate ecological equivalence to be achieved across most of Brazil in a cost-effective way and without impairing productive lands when seeking to meet the Legal Reserve targets.

TI  - Restoration of riparian ecosystems posterior to tin mining in the Central Amazon: Restoration indicators and selection of suitable species for planting
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian forests are fundamental for water and soil protection and favor the creation of gene flow corridors between forest remnants. The restoration of riparian forests by seedling planting can usually accelerate the succession process, but these ecosystems are seldom evaluated in post-mined areas in the Amazon. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the restoration trajectory of riparian forests after tin mining, using composition and structure indicators along with the selectin of the most suitable species for planting ac-cording to height and DBH increments. A total of eight riparian forests of different planting ages (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2021/2022) were evaluated, being currently 8.5 (RF_8.5), 7.5 (RF_7.5), 6.5 (RF_6.5), 5.5 (RF_5.5) and <= 1.5 (RF_1.5) years old. Permanent plots of 30 m x 30 m were allocated in each forest, with the number of units varying according to the total area size, with a minimum of 3 plots allocated. Our results show a gradual increase in the density of individuals and species over the three evaluations performed, emphasizing RF_6.5 and RF_1.5 areas. Using the NMDS analysis, the RF_8.5 and RF_1.5 did not present any floristic-structural similarities. The 10 species with the highest IVI represented more than 60% of the total in all the restored ecosystems. V. guianenses presented the highest relative density for all ecosystems under restoration, except for RF_1.5, which S. alata was highlighted. P. pendula was the most suitable for planting in all assessed riparian forests when mortality and height and diameter increments were taken into consideration. Species with bio-economic potential, such as C. guianensis, H. courbaril, E. precatoria and M. flexuosa, were also classified as efficient and considered structuring species.

TI  - Leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and growth responses of Genipa americana seedlings to soil flooding
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of soil flooding on photosynthesis and growth of Genipa americana L. seedlings, a neotropical fruit-tree species used in gallery forest restoration programs, were studied under glasshouse conditions. Despite the high survival rate and wide distribution in flood-prone habitats of the neotropics, previous studies demonstrated that growth of G. americana is reduced under soil flooding. Using leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, we tested the hypothesis that stomatal limitation of photosynthesis is the main factor that reduces carbon uptake and growth rates of G. americana seedlings. Throughout a 63-day flooding period, the survival rates were 100%. The maximum values of the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g(s)) of control seedlings were 9.86 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 0.525 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The earliest effects of flooding were significant decreases in g(s) and A, development of hypertrophied lenticels and decrease in the dry weight of roots. A strong effect of the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (LAVPD) on g(s) and A were observed that was enhanced under flooded conditions. Between 14 and 63 days after flooding, significant reductions in g(s) (31.7% of control) and A (52.9% of control) were observed followed by significant increments in non-photochemical quenching (q(N)) (187.5% of control). During the same period, there were no differences among treatments for the ratio between variable to initial fluorescence (F-v/F-0), the maximum quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (F-v/F-m) and photochemical quenching (q(p)), indicating that there was no damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Based on the results, we conclude that decreases in stomatal opening and stomatal limitation of photosynthesis, followed by decrease in individual leaf area are the main causes of reductions in carbon uptake and whole plant biomass of flooded seedlings.

TI  - Seed germination requirements of Trembleya laniflora (Melastomataceae), an endemic species from neotropical montane rocky savannas
T2  - PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Trembleya laniflora is an endemic shrub from neotropical montane rocky savannas of southeastern Brazil. It has been indicated as a potential candidate for ecological restoration of abandoned iron-ore mines due to heavy metal accumulation. Here, we evaluated the seed germination requirements of T. laniflora. Seeds collected in 2005 and 2008 were set to germinate under a broad range of temperature and light conditions. Seed viability was estimated by dissecting seeds under a dissecting microscope for embryo presence/absence. Seeds were photoblastic and optimum temperature range was 20-25 degrees C, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Seeds were viable after 42 months of storage, which together with small seeds that easily get buried and light requirement for germination suggest formation of soil seed banks. Except the large fraction of embryoless seeds, almost all tested seeds germinated when incubated under light conditions; therefore, T. laniflora should be regarded to have nondormant seeds. Easiness of burial resulting from small seed size and positive photoblastism may both contribute to incorporation into soil seed banks. Our data suggest that the long-term storage of T. laniflora seeds provides a useful strategy for plant reintroduction.

TI  - The invasion of Pteridium aquilinum and the impoverishment of the seed bank in fire prone areas of Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have documented that fires are widespread in the tropics. Because fire in the Atlantic Rain Forest is rare, fire events and their consequences at the community level have not been evaluated. This study describes the composition of different seed banks in areas of Atlantic Forest. The study was carried out in the National Park of Tijuca in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Four different areas were chosen considering their differences on fire history. Fifteen soil surface samples (23 cm (centimeter) diameter x7 cm height at 5 cm deep) were obtained from random locations within each site. The dominant family at all study sites except in the most preserved one were Dennstaetiaceae, followed by Melastomataceae and Poaceae. The family Dennstaetiaceae was exclusively represented by Pteridium aquilinum (Klf.) Herter. There were no significant differences among areas when comparing the number of seedlings excluding P. aquilinum. However, the number of P. aquilinum was higher in the most disturbed area, while Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae were more frequent in a less impacted area. Our results suggest that the seed bank in disturbed areas of the Atlantic Forest possibly will not contribute for forest restoration after disturbance.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF A 5-YEAR-OLD REHABILITATED RIPARIAN FOREST: IS IT ALREADY SUSTAINABLE?
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - As important as the establishment of projects of ecological restoration is its assessment post-implementation to know whether the area is becoming self-sustainable or need to be redirected. In this way, this study aimed to know the current situation of a 5-year-old rehabilitated riparian forest, inserted in an anthropogenic impacted region, at the das Velhas River, Minas Gerais State, studying the canopy openness and recruitment of seedlings as plant indicators. 15 plots were allocated in the forest, where hemispherical photographs were taken to analyze the canopy openness and evaluate all seedlings from 0.30 m to 1.30 m height. Canopy openness ranged from 23.7% to 38.8% between seasons and only 192 seedlings were found, from 13 species, five of them exotic and aggressive. Although canopy openness was low, it seems that lateral penetration of light has been favoring the development and dominancy of plants from invasive species, whereas few native ones have been recruited. The exotic/invasive plants may compromise the success of restoration mainly by competition with native planted species. The outcomes evidenced an unsustainability of the riparian forest and the requirement of some management actions to control exotic and invasive plants and ensure the preservation of the area and its ecological roles over time.

TI  - CONTROL METHODS OF BRACHIARIA (Urochloa decumbens Stapf.) IN AN ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AREA IN RIPARIAN FOREST, FEDERAL DISTRICT
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Brachiaria is an important forage grass for many regions of Brazil, when it occurs in native areas, represents a problem for the functioning of natural ecosystems and threats to plant diversity. The objective was to evaluate three methods of control of Brachiaria, using cover plants and plastic coverage. The study was carried out in banks of Ponte Alta River, Gama, DF, Brazil, an area in process of restoration. The experimental design was three complete randomized blocks in a factorial (4 types of treatments x 2 times), with three replications. The treatments were installed in March/2013 (1st) and December/2013 (2nd). as follows: T1 - planting peanut-forage seedlings (Arachis pintoi Krapov W.C. & Greg.); T2 - plastic coverage (1.20 m x 2 m). T3 - seeding of Stylosanthes Campo Grande (Stylosanthes capitata Vogel + Stylosanthes macrocephala M. B. Ferreira & Sousa Costa) and T4 - control. The monthly monitoring of the percentage of coverage of the plants was conducted. The percentage of coverage was compared between the two periods and between the treatments by ANOVA and Tukey test. In the first period, there were no significant differences in grass cover among treatments, except for control, which was higher (88.85%). In the second period, the treatments differed among themselves, with less grass cover in plastic coverage (11.65%) and Stylosanthes (19%). The plastic coverage and Stylosanthes (high density) were the most efficient treatments for the control of grass, regardless of period. Native species with potential for the control of aggressive alien species can assist the ecological restoration.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION OF A DEGRADAD AREA BY SAND EXPLOTATION IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT, BRAZIL
T2  - ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to contribute to the recovery of degraded areas in the cerrado. The study site is located in the Federal District, Brazil, and includes quartzitic sand exploration under cerrado stricto sensu, with deforestation licensed by IBRAM/DF. Natural regeneration was investigated after the exploration of sand, due to the return of the original surface soil layer (topsoil) to the area, and the influence of a hydrogel polymer on the survival of native seedlings planted with the objective to facilitate forest restoration. The results indicated a mortality in the community planted of 11% in seven months, considered low and may be related to the efficiency of hydrogel polymer. Natural regeneration, absent at the time of planting, was intense in the second evaluation, when it recorded a prevalence of Mimosa claussenii Benth, representing between 26 and 50% soil cover. The results suggest the effectiveness of the degraded area back to the original topsoil, as transports cuttings from plants, which makes forest restoration, and the efficiency of using polymer as a soil conditioner.

TI  - Preliminary results of using green manure species as a cost-effective option for forest restoration
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing costs of implementation and maintenance of restoration activities is crucial for a project's success. In order to achieve it, direct seeding and the use of green manure species have been proposed as potential alternatives. Here, we compare some preliminary results on seedlings performance and cost on four restoration techniques including these alternatives in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In 16 plots, we established: (1) conventional seedling planting of 20 native species (2x3m spacing between plants), (2) direct seeding of Senna alata among the seedlings of the 20 native species; (3) direct seeding of Cajanus cajan among seedlings of the 20 native species and; (4) direct seeding of Leucaena leucocephala in the inter-row of the 20 native species seedlings. A year later seedling performance (survival and growth) resulted similar among these four techniques. However, costs of using Senna and Cajanus were consistently lower, mainly during the maintenance phase due to the reduction of fertilization and individual protection needs. Introducing green manure species by direct seeding may be a useful strategy to complement and eventually replace planting seedlings of other high-growth rate species to rapidly cover the soil surface. This approach may partially reduce some financial costs, particularly at the early stages of projects. Other strategies should be evaluated to complement our results.

TI  - Effects of soil flooding on leaf gas exchange and growth of two neotropical pioneer tree species
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) and Rapanea ferruginea (Ruiz & Pavon) Mez (Myrsinaceae) are two neotropical pioneer trees with wide geographical distribution in South America, highly degree of adaptation to different soil conditions and intense regeneration in areas with anthropic activities. With the aim to recommend the use Schinus and Rapanea in gallery forest restoration programs, we conducted an experiment with the objective to analyze the capacity of these two pioneer trees to tolerate soil flooding, mainly by accessing the effects of flooding on leaf gas exchange, growth and dry matter partitioning. Seedling survival throughout the 56-day flooding period were 100 and 90% for Schinus and Rapanea, respectively. The mean values of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthesis (A) observed in the control seedlings were, respectively, 0.4 mol m(-2) s(-1) and 14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for Schinus, and 0.5 mol m(-2) s(-1) and 14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), for Rapanea. On day 20 flooding reduced g(s) and A by 36 and 29% in Schinus, and 81 and 61% in Rapanea. At the end of the experiment, significant decreases were also observed for root and whole plant biomass, in both species. Based on the results, we concluded that seedlings of Schinus and Rapanea can survive and grow throughout a medium period of soil waterlogging, in spite of the alterations observed in their physiological behavior, such as the decreases in stomatal conductance and in whole plant biomass.

TI  - Direct seeding of native fruit tree species with economic benefits in a Brazilian Cerrado managed landscape
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting native species of economic interest is attractive to ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation because of their potential to generate income, products and services, combining socioeconomic and environmental demands. Direct seeding is a low-cost restoration technique compared to nursery-raised seedling planting, but there is still a lack of information about restoration success in different savanna habitat types in Brazil. We tested direct seeding of six fruit tree species of the Brazilian Cerrado in a landscape compressed by five management regimes used by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in northern Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. We monitored germination, survival, growth and establishment for three years. Of the 9000 seeds planted, 18.7% germinated, 29.8% survived and 8.9% were established three years after sowing. Eugenia dysenterica (Mart.) DC. and Dypterix alata Vogel had higher germination, survival and establishment rates and are, thus, the most appropriate species. E. dysenterica showed high rates on native and managed Cerrado and D. alata in agroforestry system, hillside fields and lower field. The species studied are well adapted to conditions of water scarcity and low soil fertility. However, phosphorus concentration may be a limiting factor to species growth. Our results suggest that direct seeding of fruit tree species of the Cerrado is promising to some species, and to others, the sowing should be done with more seeds, or using nursery-raised seedling. The planting of fruit trees could be a practice that allow smallholders farmers to increase biodiversity at the same time that could contribute to their livelihoods.

TI  - Can intensive silvicultural management minimize the effects of frost on restoration plantations in subtropical regions?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is one of the main factors that influence field establishment of forest species. In high-altitude tropical regions and in subtropical regions, the occurrence of frost represents an important restriction in the trajectory and continuity of ecological processes. Thus, we aimed to characterize frost damage in nine native forest species under different silvicultural management schemes in plantations for the restoration of a riparian forest area in southern Brazil. The experiment was carried out in the Quarta ColOnia State Park, and seedlings of nine native tree species, representing the Subtropical Seasonal Forest. Frost damage was measured using a visual damage scale based on the frost damage experienced in the winter of 2016. In addition, to evaluate the resilience of the species, height and diameter data were collected over the duration of the experiment. The species Solanum mauritianum was classified as frost resistant; therefore, we propose that it should be recommended for cultivation in regions where frost events usually occur. The other species studied, both the pioneers, S. terebinthifolius, Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Ceiba speciosa, and Inga marginata, as well as the secondary ones, Actinostemon concolor, Trichina elegans, T. claussenii, and Eugenia rostrifolia, were influenced by the silvicultural management schemes used. Plants managed under intensive silviculture showed lower levels of frost damage and higher survival rates.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the governance of forest landscape restoration (FLR) in Esp & iacute;rito Santo, Brazil, based on its FLR initiatives and social actors. We discuss enabling conditions for the FLR governance system to upscale the total restored area and to involve farmers in FLR initiatives in Ita & uacute;nas and S & atilde;o Mateus watersheds. Data were collected through interviews and participatory workshops between 2018 and 2020. We identified 22 initiatives - programs, projects and actions - between 2001 and 2021, coordinated by public and private social actors. The initiatives refer to the FLR chain development, land use plans and assessments, the payment for environmental services programs, academic research, technical assistance and actions to raise awareness of rural producers. The FLR network is made up of different social actors engaged in multiple FLR initiatives and led mainly by public actors. Human and social capital, institutional arrangements and financial resources present in the initiatives point to a path for the advancement of forest restoration and the participation of farmers.

TI  - Agroforestry systems in the rural landscape in Terra Nova do Norte-MT: space metrics in aiding environmental conservation policies in family production areas
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this article was to analyze the spatial structure of rural properties and the agroforestry systems (AFS) that compose them, in the rural landscape of Terra Nova do Norte (State of Mato Grosso, Brazil). The study area corresponded to 202 rural properties that implemented, between 2010 and 2016, 659 AFS in their areas, 90,52% of them for restoration purposes. As measures of the spatial structure, landscape metrics were used on the area and shape of rural properties and AFS. The results indicate that all properties are family farms, with an average area of 55,85 ha, rectangular formats (mean of the shape index of: 1,75), and they were concentrated around the urban area. The AFS presented, in the majority, small areas with a mean area of: 0,43 ha and varied formats (average of the index of form: 2,28), according to their objectives in the property (AFS of production and AFS of restoration of permanent preservation areas around water courses and springs). AFS still do not represent a significant area in the rural properties analyzed (2,49% of the total rural properties area), but they are shown as a viable alternative to initiate the process of restoration of protected areas and to diversify the productive matrix, reintroducing the component trees in the landscape in a post-deforestation scenario.

TI  - Edge effects in forest patches surrounded by native grassland are also dependent on patch size and shape
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our knowledge of biodiversity responses to fragmentation comes from human-driven fragmentation processes. However, evaluating forest patches with natural edge can produce useful models to understand how the micro environmental gradient between forest edge and interior shapes the plant communities, regardless habitat loss. Here, we tested how forest edges and interiors differ in soil characteristics, communities' structure and diversity metrics, and the extent to which these differences are related to forest size and shape of patches. We present data of ten tropical montane cloud forest patches surrounded by native non-forest vegetation (highland grasslands) of southeast Brazil. In each forest, we established five plots right on the edge and five randomly distributed over the forest interior. Our dataset covers a total of 5495 trees, and the main findings showed that patches with natural edges are also influenced by the edge effect, affecting the structure, species composition and soil variables. We found that with the increase in distance from the forest edge, the soils became more acid, with greater accumulation of organic matter, phosphorus, silt and sand, in contrast, the content of total exchangeable bases and clay decreased. When accounting for the effect of patch size and shape in the relationships between forest habitat and the structural community metrics, tree density and upper 95-percentile stem diameter tended to be higher in larger patches. In contrast, aboveground biomass and median stem diameter were positively related to patch shape in forest interiors. In addition, species composition showed marked differences between habitats, but rarefied species richness and Fisher's diversity index were higher, in the interior, only in large patches. These results indicate that besides differences between forest habitats, with increasing patch size and circularity, the differences become more pronounced. We would like to highlight that in conservation and management decisions, peculiarities of each habitat must be taken into account, with techniques that assess the surrounding matrix (man-made or natural) and that consider the edge and the interior as distinct habitats.

TI  - Enrichment planting to restore degraded tropical forest fragments in Brazil
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical areas with high levels of fragmentation due to agricultural use, forest fragments play an important role for biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale. But these fragments are subject to recurrent disturbances, which lead to arrested succession and loss of functional groups. In such cases, active restoration, such as enrichment planting, could facilitate recovery. We studied enrichment planting methods to restore tropical forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and we evaluated the costs to implement them in the field. We planted four later successional tree species as seeds, small seedlings, and large seedlings in three remnants embedded in a landscape dominated by sugarcane plantations. Overall, survival of seedlings was low using all methods due to a severe drought during the study period, and there were no differences in seedling survival or growth across the three study sites. Direct seeding was the least expensive technique but was successful only for one large-seeded species, Hymenaea courbaril. Large seedlings survived better than did small seedlings, for all four species, suggesting that the additional cost of growing large seedlings is warranted to enhance success. Our results highlight that a combination of planting methods at species level is likely to increase restoration success.

TI  - PHYTOSOCIOLOGY AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WOODY REGENERATION FROM A REFORESTATION WITH NATIVE SPECIES IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, specifically in Sao Paulo State, there are guidelines based on the high diversity of tropical forests that instructs the restoration projects in the state (current SMA 32/2014). The main goal of this study was verify the importance and effectiveness of the high diversity of arboreal species originated from a reforestation, and its influence in a woody regenerating composition. We developed a phytosociologic study in a woody regenerating stratum of a nine year old reforestation at a Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN), in Mogi-Guacu, Sao Paulo State. All specimens with height >= 30 cm and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) < 5 cm were evaluated. The woody regenerating diversity was smaller than the overstory diversity and the species composition was similar to the overstory. The Simpson index (1-D) was 0.85, Shannon index (H') was 2.46 and the Pielou index (J') was 0.60. The zoochoric dispersion syndrome was major among the species. Our results suggest that the use of high diversity of native seedlings in a reforestation leads to high diversity of species in woody regeneration stratum, after one decade of planting.

TI  - Early ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations for restoring agricultural landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed tree plantings and natural regeneration are the main restoration approaches for recovering tropical forests worldwide. Despite substantial differences in implementation costs between these methods, little is known regarding how they differ in terms of ecological outcomes, which is key information for guiding decision making and cost-effective restoration planning. Here, we compared the early ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in agricultural landscapes. We assessed and compared vegetation structure and composition in young (7-20yr old) mixed tree plantings (PL), second-growth tropical forests established on former pastures (SGp), on former Eucalyptus spp. plantations (SGe), and in old-growth reference forests (Ref). We sampled trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) 1-5cm (saplings) and trees at DBH > 5cm (trees) in a total of 32 20x45m plots established in these landscapes. Overall, the ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and restoration plantations were markedly different. SGe forests showed higher abundance of large (DBH>20cm) nonnative species, of which 98% were resprouting Eucalyptus trees, than SGp and PL, and higher total aboveground biomass; however, aboveground biomass of native species was higher in PL than in SGe. PL forests had lower abundance of native saplings and lianas than both naturally established second-growth forests, and lower proportion of animal dispersed saplings than SGe, probably due to higher isolation from native forest remnants. Rarefied species richness of trees was lower in SGp, intermediate in SGe and Ref and higher in PL, whereas rarefied species richness of saplings was higher in SG than in Ref. Species composition differed considerably among regeneration types. Although these forests are inevitably bound to specific landscape contexts and may present varying outcomes as they develop through longer time frames, the ecological particularities of forests established through different restoration approaches indicate that naturally established forests may not show similar outcomes to mixed tree plantings. The results of this study underscore the importance that restoration decisions need to be based on more robust expectations of outcomes that allow for a better analysis of the cost-effectiveness of different restoration approaches before scaling-up forest restoration in the tropics.

TI  - Phosphate fertilization in the initial growth of seven native forest species intended for the recovery of a degraded area
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - For an effective forest restoration, knowledge about the initial growth of plants is of fundamental importance. Among the aspects to be considered, the nutritional requirements of the species used for this purpose stand out, considering that these areas generally have low fertility soils, which can hinder the establishment and growth of the planted species. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of phosphate fertilization on native forest species, destined to the recovery of a degraded area. The experiment was carried out at the Center for Scientific and Technological Development at UFLA - Fazenda Muquem, located in the municipality of Lavras, Minas Gerais. The experimental design used was in complete randomized blocks, with 12 replicates and one plant per plot, in a 7 x 4 factorial scheme, with seven species and four doses of simple superphosphate (0, 150, 300 and 450 grams/pit). At 60 days after planting, data on percentage of survival, diameter at ground level and plant height were collected. At 300 days, in addition to the diameter and height, the canopy projection area of the plants was evaluated. The species showed high percentages of survival, with the exception of Inga edulis, with 58% survival. Among the seven species studied, Schinus terebinthifolius and Guazuma ulmifolia were the ones that showed the highest growth in the analyzed parameters, being, therefore, the species with the greatest potential for a faster covering of this area. Phosphate fertilization influenced, in a different way, the initial growth of the seven species, in relation to the doses of simple superphosphate applied. It is recommended to dose 250 grams of simple superphosphate per hole, as a basic fertilization for all species.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL WATER QUALITY ALONG A RURAL TO URBAN LAND USE GRADIENT USING BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE-BASED INDEXES
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural practices such as livestock grazing and tilling can result in soil erosion and runoff of fine sediments, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and pesticides, leading to degradation of aquatic environments. Urbanization is also responsible for a variety of impacts on fluvial ecosystems, including pollution by heavy metals, oil, domestic sewage and garbage. In this study, we evaluate the impact of land use on stream health of the Uberabinha river catchment. Overall, rural streams presented better ecological conditions than urban streams. Both species composition and abundance of benthic communities showed significant differences between rural and urban streams. Urban streams presented a higher dominance of Oligochaeta, Hirudinea and Gastropoda, bioindicators of poor water quality. Rural streams presented significantly greater richness and diversity. Compared to urban streams, rural streams presented a significantly higher number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata and Hemiptera taxa. Our analyses also showed congruence (high correlation) among the classical biodiversity metrics (Shannon-Wiener index - H', Pielou's measure of eveness - J) and monitoring parameters (% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera - EPT, Biological Monitoring Work Party - BMWP, bioindicator approach and Rapid Assessment Protocol - RAP, a habitatbased approach). Five from seven rural streams presented good water quality according to both BMWP and RAP and none of the urban streams presented good water quality. Our results show that the urban streams of Uberlandia municipality are poor ecosystems, and require improved management actions by environmental authorities. We also encourage that the riparian forest restoration and management carried out in the upper portion of Uberabinha River catchment to be extended to the urban area of the municipality.

TI  - Random forest for spatialization of daily evapotranspiration (ET0) in watersheds in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of daily data on reference evapotranspiration (ET0) has increased in recent years due to its relevance in planning and decision making regarding irrigated agriculture, water production, and forest restoration. Facing the scarcity of this information measured in loco, the study of interpolation methods capable of representing ET0 becomes important. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of the Random Forest (RF) method in the spatialization of ET0 in the watersheds of the Mid-South region of the Espirito Santo State, located within the Atlantic Forest biome, Brazil. From this study, it was found that the RF method is the most suitable one for ET0 spatialization when compared to the Angular distance weighting (ADW) and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) techniques. Also, the spatializations carried out by this method were transformed into databases in a grid format and made available online. Furthermore, the RF database was also compared to other ET0 grid databases, and it was concluded that the RF database also carried out a better performance than the other ones.

TI  - The São Paulo State (Brazil) Ecological Fiscal Transfer: Distributive and environmental effects
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To restore 12 million hectares of native vegetation in Brazil by 2030, aligning environmental policies with incentive measures is crucial. The Ecological Fiscal Transfer (known as Ecological ICMS in Brazil) allows states to redistribute the ICMS tax (similar to the Value Added Tax) revenue based on environmental criteria, likely motivating municipalities to take environmental action. Sao Paulo recently modified its ecological ICMS legislation, increasing the ICMS revenue distributed according to environmental criteria and introducing a new criterion for native vegetation cover. We assessed the impact of these changes on tax redistribution, considering three scenarios: the former rules (2021), the new rules (2025), and the new rules with 1.5 million hectares of vegetation restored (2042). While the pattern of ICMS distribution remained mostly unchanged, there were distributional effects. Some municipalities lost up to 5% of their initial revenue, while others with high socio-environmental importance doubled their revenues. Existing environmental criteria still lack incentives for local environmental policies. However, the new criterion for native vegetation cover could, with practical limitations, boost municipal revenue after restoring 1.5 million hectares. Sao Paulo's initiative to incorporate native vegetation cover into an Ecological Fiscal Transfer policy holds the potential to inspire similar tax-based environmental incentives worldwide. However, it must be adapted to motivate local governments to embrace restoration actions rather than serving primarily as a compensatory measure.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

TI  - Accelerating Capoeira Regeneration on Degraded Pastures in the Northeastern Amazon by the Use of Pigs or Cattle
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the humid tropics of Latin America, considerable proportions of agro-scapes are covered with degraded pastures that were taken over by dense weedy shrub canopies hampering further forest succession. While tree seeds are still constantly dispersed by bats and birds, these often do not reach the soil but got stuck in the dense shrubby vegetation. While manual up-rooting of weedy shrubs or tree replantation is too expensive, we tested if burrowing pigs or trampling cattle can enhance proportions of bare soils for fallow restoration. These hypotheses were tested in on-farm experiments at Igarape-Acu, northeastern Para. Soil-opening effects of ten pigs (40 days + nights) and ten oxen (40 overnight stays), respectively, were tested against manual clearing and control on three plots per treatment, respectively. Ground cover percentages of bare soil, weedy shrubs, grasses, and tree species were visually determined in 40 plots/treatment before and directly after treatments, and half a year later (n = 480 samples). Both animal treatments could not really match manual clearing (62%) but pigs reached above 36% bare ground cover, while cattle just 20%. As pigs are almost omnipresent on Amazonian smallholdings and even give a modest economic refund, the use of pigs is recommended to smallholders who want to break up the lush weed layers for the benefit of forest restoration.

TI  - Avoided deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia: Simulating the effect of the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Juma Sustainable Development Reserve, located in Brazil's state of Amazonas, was the first protected area in Brazil to be benefited by a Reducing Emissions from a Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project. However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695 km(2)) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647 km(2)) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219 km(2)) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052 km(2)) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395 km(2)) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g = 1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project. Leakage must be accounted for in REDD projects because the deforestation resulting from this effect could generate "hot air" (carbon credit with no additionality). Over longer time horizons the benefits of reserves are greater and leakage losses are recovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lacustrine records of Holocene flood pulse dynamics in the Upper Paraguay River watershed (Pantanal wetlands, Brazil)
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is the world's largest tropical wetland and a biodiversity hotspot, yet its response to Quaternary environmental change is unclear. To address this problem, sediment cores from shallow lakes connected to the Upper Paraguay River (PR) were analyzed and radiocarbon dated to track changes in sedimentary environments. Stratal relations, detrital particle size, multiple biogeochemical indicators, and sponge spicules suggest fluctuating lake-level lowstand conditions between similar to 11,000 and 5300 cal yr BP, punctuated by sporadic and in some cases erosive flood flows. A hiatus has been recorded from similar to 5300 to 2600 cal yr BP, spurred by confinement of the PR within its channel during an episode of profound regional drought. Sustained PR flooding caused a transgression after similar to 2600 cal yr BP, with lake-level highstand conditions appearing during the Little Ice Age. Holocene PR flood pulse dynamics are best explained by variability in effective precipitation, likely driven by insolation and tropical sea-surface temperature gradients. Our results provide novel support for hypotheses on: (1) stratigraphic discontinuity of floodplain sedimentary archives; (2) late Holocene methane flux from Southern Hemisphere wetlands; and (3) pre-colonial indigenous ceramics traditions in western Brazil.

TI  - Climate benefits of Amazon secondary forests-recent advances and research needs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research.

TI  - InSAR Time Series Analysis of L-Band Data for Understanding Tropical Peatland Degradation and Restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite radar observations are employed to reveal spatiotemporal changes in ground surface height of peatlands that have, and have not, undergone restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our time series analysis of 26 scenes of Advanced Land Observation Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic-Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired between 2006 and 2010 suggests that peatland restoration was positively affected by the construction time of dams-the earlier the dam was constructed, the more significant the restoration appears. The results also suggest that the dams resulted in an increase of ground water level, which in turn stopped peat losing height. For peatland areas without restoration, the peatland continuously lost peat height by up to 7.7 cm/yr. InSAR-derived peat height changes allow the investigation of restoration effects over a wide area and can also be used to indirectly assess the relative magnitude and spatial pattern of peatland damage caused by drainage and fires. Such an assessment can provide key information for guiding future restoration activities.

TI  - High Loss of Plant Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity Due to Simulated Extinctions of Pollinators and Seed Dispersers in a Tropical Savanna
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of the factors driving extinctions is fundamental to conservation biology. Here, we assessed the likely consequences of extinction of pollinators and dispersers for phylogenetic and functional diversity of savanna woody plant species. Loss of phylogenetic diversity was greater than expected by chance in simulated extinctions of moth- and beetle-pollinated species, and bird- and mammal-dispersed species. In extinction simulations of bee and bat-pollinated species, the loss of functional diversity was greater than expected by chance. Two main features could drive greater loss of biodiversity than expected by chance: loss of clumped species and loss of very unique species. Pollination and dispersal modes must be taken into account in conservation plans or ecological restoration strategies, since communities may be differentially vulnerable to the loss of one of these processes. Both functional and phylogenetic components of biodiversity should be considered, as consequences of extinctions for one are not necessarily the same as for the other.

TI  - FLORISTIC AND STRUCTURE OF THE SHRUB-TREE LAYER OF A FOREST RESTORED TO 40 YEARS, VICOSA, MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the woody shrub layer of a restored forest through planting after 40 years of its implementation, in Vicosa, MG. It was allocated in the total area of one hectare, 16 contiguous plots of 25 x 25 m to assess the woody shrub layer, recording all individuals with PBH >= 15 cm. It was recorded 1,432 individuals, 112 species and 36 families, of which 95 were native and 16 were exotic species, with higher Importance Value for Guarea guidonia and Fabaceae family, high diversity (H'= 3.51) and low ecological dominance (J' = 0.743), higher percentage of early secondary successional class at the species level (34.82%), and late secondary at the level of individuals (34.29%), and predominance of syndrome of seed dispersal by animals. The basal area was 47.8 m(2)/ha and the average height of 10.6 m, ranging from 2.2 m to 27.2 m. The 0-20 cm layer soil had a an average base saturation (V = 43.40%) and 20-40 cm layer of low base saturation (V = 34.70%), with soil density (1.08 and 1.07 kg / m(3)) within the ideal range for clay soils. The restored forest after 40 years reached a level similar to semideciduous seasonal forests in advanced stages of succession, in Vicosa, MG, in terms of phytosociological parameters.

TI  - Agroforestry system used for restoration at the Atlantic Forest
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian new environmental law permits the use of agroforestry systems to restore degraded areas protected by legislation, especially in small farms. One question that arises is if it is possible to reduce costs of the restoration process with these agroforestry systems and, at the same time, to offer ecological services, similar to afforestation with the exclusive use of native species of the Atlantic Forest biome. Seeking results to proof the effectivity, an agroforestry system established in 2005, at Seropedica, RJ state, with the objective of connecting two forest fragments, went through a series of evaluations realized on the ecological effectiveness on the connection of these fragments. The results indicated that the quantity and quality of soil fauna and mycorrhizal fungi obtained benefits by the agroforestry system in comparison to the pasture matrix, but are still at lower levels than the forest fragments. Pasture near the agroforestry system has benefited from the environmental improvement there, originated from a "positive edge effect", a situation quite different from the pasture that was farther from the area of influence of the agroforestry corridor. For the indicators used, the agroforestry system was efficient.

TI  - Revealing the Permanent and Transient Plant Understory in Gallery Forests in the Cerrado of Central Brazil
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The understories of tropical forests comprise complex communities and can be divided into permanent understory, where the generally shade-tolerant plant growth forms are less developed in height, and transient understory, where young tree individuals are only temporarily present. Despite a high contribution to species richness in tropical forests, the understory is poorly studied. Here, we examined the species composition, richness, structure, diversity, and the relative contribution of growth forms in permanent and transient understories of gallery forests in the Brazilian Cerrado. A total of 211 species distributed into sixty-seven families and 153 genera were sampled. The most species-rich family was Rubiaceae, and Miconia was the genus with the highest species richness. The species Hildaea pallens had the highest importance in the forests. The best-represented growth forms were tree seedlings, followed by shrubs and lianas. The transient component of the understory in gallery forests was the most diverse. However, in terms of species relative cover, both transient and permanent understory species contributed equally to the understory structure, mainly due to the high cover of Poaceae species. Our study is the first to examine composition, structure, diversity, and growth forms in the permanent and transient understories of gallery forests. Study Implications: Our study is innovative in describing the plant community attributes of gallery forest understories in the Brazilian Cerrado. The understories of tropical forests comprise complex communities and can be divided into permanent and transient understory. The transient component of the understory in gallery forests was the most diverse, represented by seedlings and young tree specimens. However, in terms of species relative cover, both transient and permanent understory species contributed equally to the understory structure. Here, we provide evidence that may be useful to initiatives seeking to conduct ecological restoration and conservation of gallery forests in the Cerrado.

TI  - Ecosystem restoration after bauxite mining: favorable indicators for Technosols construction and soil management using liming and subsoiling
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although its economic importance, bauxite mining causes the loss of natural ecosystems. In this sense, the Technosols building from materials made or modified by man, such as mine tailings, is necessary for recovering degraded areas. Additionally, the Technosols management, such as subsoiling and liming, increases chances of plants establishment and growth. In this study, a degraded area by bauxite mining with constructed Technosol in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil, was tested under three different soil management treatments: Technosol-1 (Tech-1), Liming only; Technosol-2 (Tech-2), Subsoiling + 200 g of NPK in the pit; Technosol-3 (Tech-3), Scarification + liming + all Tech-2 procedures. In every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed: structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity, ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural regeneration and common in early successional stages. Coverage rates in all treatments showed less than 5% of exposed Technosol and the diversity, ecological group, and dispersal syndrome indexes followed a successful trajectory along 8 years. Tech-2 and Tech-3 presented the best chemical attributes and nutrients in the litter stock, but they would probably last several decades to reach the R-forest attributes. Thus, subsoiling alone or with liming provided the best chemical results for soil, litter, and vegetation performance, being recommended to speed up restoration of degrades areas by bauxite mining in the Amazon.

TI  - Atlantic Forest Fragmentation Analysis and Landscape Restoration Management Scenarios
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - The goals of this research were to analyze the fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest and to create landscape management scenarios for the municipality of Carmo de Minas, MG, Brazil. We used landscape metrics to analyze the fragmentation process of the study area, which was historically exploited for agropastoral activities. Future scenarios were modeled to represent the potential restoration of the environment based on the behavior of the natural vegetation units. The natural vegetation in the study area is highly fragmented, and the environmental integrity of its remnants is severely threatened. The management scenarios showed how the restored natural units behave in the landscape as well as the isolation and connectivity between them. Using these models, future dynamics of the landscape can be predicted. Two important actions for the conservation of the remaining natural vegetation were identified: the maintenance of secondary forest and the restoration of permanent preservation areas.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION OF DEFORESTED AREAS DOMINATED BY Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn LOCATED IN THE SERRA DA MANTIQUEIRA MOUNTAIN RANGE
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was set out with the objective of analyzing successional process in areas which are deforested and dominated by Pteridium aquilinum in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, by researching the natural regeneration of shrub and tree species and evaluating both disturbance history and the edaphic conditions on the natural regeneration community. This research investigated two abandoned pasture areas in Bocaina de Minas county exposed to natural regeneration intervals ranging from six years (area named 6A) to twenty years (area named 20A). The inventory occurred from sixty plots of 10 m(2), where all samples surveyed were between 0.15 m and 3 m high. All samples were identified and both the diameter in ground level and total height of the specimens were measured. The survey totaled 1,159 samples and 53 species. Melastomataceae was registered with the highest species richness and the highest specimen abundance. The two sampled areas showed species composition differences, with Jaccard similarity coefficient equal to 3.7%. The canonical correspondence analysis showed the correlations between natural regeneration stratum and non-labile phosphorus and clay in the 6A area. On the other hand, the 20A area showed correlations between plant regeneration and the K, P, Ca2+, Al3+ levels, with higher pH levels, and with the sum of exchangeable bases. In addition, the vegetation surveyed in area 20A was correlated with higher Pteridium population density. The results showed that the dominance of Pteridium aquilinum leads to successional process under inhibition, in which the ferns act negatively on the richness and abundance of shrub populations. It was also confirmed the Pteridium's affinity to steep areas, mainly in higher altitudes, where the soil is acid, as well as its preference to disturbed areas. Moreover, we highlight the fragilities of the mountain environments and the importance of preserving natural vegetation, as well as the bracken management as a strategy for forest restoration.

TI  - Grasses Control Strategies in Setting Restoration Stand of the Atlantic Forest
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of four weed control strategies in forest setting stands linked by a set of Atlantic Forest tree species. Four treatments were employed: mechanical - manual hoeing and mowing; chemical - glyphosate herbicide application in the total area; chemical - cultural - herbicide spraying and herbaceous legume intercropping; chemical-mechanical - herbicide planting in rows and mowing in the interrows. Diameter, crown area and soil cover percentage of the eight tree species were assessed at 18 months. Herbicide spraying in total area promoted the greatest reduction in weed populations, as well as superior growth in height, diameter, crown area and soil cover of the tree species. More interventions were necessary in the treatment of mechanical weed control that has also shown the least growth of the tree species. The chemical method was the most effective in weed control and promoted the greatest growth of the tree species.

TI  - MINERAL NUTRITION IN THE TREE Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess. (Calophyllaceae)
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian and gallery forests located at the "arc of deforestation" have been undergoing fast degradation. With the implementation of the new Brazilian Forest Code (Law 12,651 of 2012), these can be reduced further. Thus, new studies on seedling production for ecological restoration should be carried out using native species from the Amazon and Cerrado. The objective of the present study was to assess under which shading levels the seedlings of Calophyllum brasiliense, a tree species typical of humid environments, show the highest values of growth and nutrient use efficiency, aiming at using these seedlings for restoration. The study was carried out in a plant nursery of the State University of Mato Grosso in Nova Xavantina, Brazil. We assessed seedling growth in diameter, height, number of leaves, production of shoot and root dry mass, Dickson quality index (DQI), and efficiency in the internal use of nutrients (EIUN) in greenhouses at 0 (full sunlight), 30, 50, 70, and 90% shading. The treatments at 50 and 70% shading showed the best results. Ecologically, the species responds well under both gap conditions (50% shading) and canopy or closing gap conditions (70% shading). Our results showed that the ideal conditions to produce seedlings of this species with high EIUN are obtained in greenhouses with 70% shading.

TI  - Management Recommendation Generation for Areas Under Forest Restoration Process through Images Obtained by UAV and LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was weed control + plant seedlings (34%) for all evaluated methods. The image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient, mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations.

TI  - Direct seeding of 16 Brazilian savanna trees: responses to seed burial, mulching and an invasive grass
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsTo address whether seed and seedling functional traits have a significant effect on germination rates and seedling survival in direct-seeding restoration efforts. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) seed burial only favours the emergence of round seeds; and (2) straw mulching improves soil moisture and prevents the emergence of the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens, promoting the establishment of native tree seedlings.LocationExperimental field, Central Brazil. Savanna, recently dominated by exotic pasture.MethodsWe evaluated the effects of seed burial (surface and buried) and mulching (no-mulch, 5-cm straw mulch and 10-cm straw mulch) on the emergence, survival and growth of 16 species of native Cerrado tree species with variable seed sizes and shapes and seedling types. Thirty seeds of each species were sown per treatment combination in three blocks.ResultsSeed burial did not affect the emergence of species with round seeds, but negatively affected species with flat seeds and phanerocotylar-epigeal-foliaceous seedlings. Straw mulching reduced the emergence of flat seeds and phanerocotylar seedlings, but increased soil moisture and strongly reduced U.decumbens emergence, resulting in a higher growth rate of tree seedlings up to 1yr for five species.ConclusionDirect seeding is an effective technique to plant a mixture of Cerrado tree species for restoration, provided the soil is well prepared and there are mechanisms to control invasive species.

TI  - Monitoring the groundwater level in tropical peatland through UAV mapping of soil surface temperature: a pilot study in Tanjung Leban, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as cost-effective, high-resolution alternatives to satellites for the environmental monitoring of large areas. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using UAV-acquired soil surface temperature to monitor groundwater level in a peatland undergoing groundwater restoration to mitigate fire risk (Tanjung Leban, Indonesia). We used two UAVs (Inspire 1, with an infrared camera, and Phantom 4) to map soil surface temperatures at 459 points on bare land. Using a spline analysis of groundwater-level and elevation data in Arc GIS 10.6, we produced ground elevation and groundwater table maps and measured the groundwater level (depth from the ground surface) at each bare-land point. Spearman's rank correlation analysis determined a negative correlation between the soil surface temperature and groundwater level. Our study shows that soil surface temperature is a reliable proxy for groundwater level in tropical peatlands. This proxy can be monitored cost-effectively using UAVs equipped with infrared cameras.

TI  - LEGAL RULES FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION: AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO HINDER THE SUCCESS OF INITIATIVES?
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - State regulation on restoration techniques is a recent development in Brazil, and to the best of our knowledge, it is unprecedented in the world. Not surprisingly controversy exists among Brazilian researchers and professionals about the appropriateness of such legislation. Here we offer a critical analysis of the resolution SMA 08 of the Secretary of Environment of the State of Sao Paulo. a law which aims to standardize the mixed planting of degraded areas. We believe that the State rules are based on assumptions not supported by scientific experimentation, since the present understanding of ecological processes involved in the restoration of tropical forests is jar from being sufficient for standards or norms to be established as yet on this vast subject. In addition, the technicians who prepare projects and those who license and monitor such projects do not have the knowledge necessary to implement the rules of the Resolution. We also argue that strict rules are likely to constrain creativity and inhibit initiatives of scientists and restoration practitioners, and thus constitute a barrier to innovation and creativity It also may well retard expansion of restoration to wider areas. From the perspective of biodiversity conservation objectives, we also believe that the creation of commercial demand for propagation material of rare and threatened species could endanger the conservation of natural populations of these species, which should be targeted for specific programs. In conclusion, we suggest that the Resolution has not helped to accelerate the expansion of restored areas nor does it increase the probability of success of restoration initiatives.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass along an elevational transect in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and the role of Fagaceae in tropical montane rain forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThis study investigates how estimated tree aboveground biomass (AGB) of tropical montane rain forests varies with elevation, and how this variation is related to elevational change in floristic composition, phylogenetic community structure and the biogeography of the dominant tree taxa.LocationLore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia.MethodsFloristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n = 7).ResultsAGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed > 50% of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family.Main conclusionsAGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks. The importance of biogeography and species traits for biomass estimation should be considered by initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and in taxon choice in reforestation for carbon offsetting.

TI  - POTENTIAL USE OF TERRESTRIAL ISOPODS AS BIOMONITORS IN THE RESTORATION ECOLOGY.
T2  - Oecologia Australis
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration Ecology aims at the restoration of degraded environments and seeks an integrated management of its resources. It has been considered as a long-term solution, not only to reconstitute the original landscape, but also to give back functionality to these enviromnments. Using tools as phytoremediation, Restoration Ecology aims to decrease or eliminate the negative effects of contaminants in polluted areas. To be effective, restoration projects need both short-term and long-term biomonitoring, and for that matter the knowledge on bioindicator organisms is required. Terrestrial isopods are macroinvertebrate detritivores that can bioaccumulate large quantities of heavy metals. They have been long used as models in the terrestrial ecotoxicology and therefore have a great potential to be employed as biomonitors during the phytoremediation of polluted lands. In Brazil, knowledge on the species' biology, ecology and distribution is still very incipient, nonetheless it is possible to identify two species with potential to be used as biomonitors. Atlantoscia floridana (Philosciidae) and Balloniscus sellowii (Balloniscidae) are Neotropical species with large geographical distribution in Brazil and show an enhanced capacity to colonize degraded lands. In the future, with a better knowledge on these species' physiology, the combination of phytoremediation and terrestrial isopods as biomonitors may enhance the ecological restoration of lands contaminated by heavy metals.

TI  - Amazon streams impacted by bauxite mining present distinct local contributions to the beta diversity of aquatic insects, fish, and macrophytes.
T2  - The Science of the total environment
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Integrating the physicochemical characteristics of aquatic environments with their biotas is essential for the conservation and monitoring of biodiversity, given the sensitivity of both the biotic and the abiotic components to environmental changes linked to water quality and human activities. In the present study, we evaluate how the contributions of different taxa to beta diversity, through local and species effects, can indicate the priority sites for conservation and ecological restoration in an Amazon region impacted by bauxite mining. We also investigate how environmental conditions at local and landscape scales influence the beta diversity of the aquatic biota. We hypothesize that unique species assemblages (a high local contribution) are more likely to be found in more degraded streams, with these assemblages being influenced strongly by local conditions and landscape characteristics. Our findings indicate that local contributions to beta diversity can be explained significantly by physicochemical variables, such as the pH and electrical conductivity of the water, with streams impacted by mining exhibiting distinct species compositions. The environmental factors affected different biological groups in distinct manners, including fish, aquatic insects (water bugs, and the larvae of mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and dragonflies), adult dragonflies, and macrophytes. Streams with unique communities also often exhibited low species richness, which highlights the need for environmental restoration. These results reinforce the value of the use of beta diversity metrics as guidelines for conservation and restoration efforts in aquatic ecosystems that have been affected by anthropogenic disturbances. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of a multi-taxon approach to ensure the formulation of a more comprehensive picture of the responses of a region's biodiversity to anthropogenic impacts.

TI  - Exotic and invasive species compromise the seed bank and seed rain dynamics in forests undergoing restoration at urban regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The control of exotic and invasive species in areas undergoing recovery is a challenge for ecological restoration and this problem may be even greater in urbanized areas. This study evaluated the seed bank and seed rain of a 5-year-old riparian forest located at the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte in southeast Brazil, and verified changes over time in the abundance and species richness and whether planted species already were providing propagules to the site. At the forest, fifteen parcels of 100 m(2) were distributed randomly and soil samples were collected thrice (October 2011, March 2012 and July 2012) to evaluate the seed bank. Seed traps were installed in nine parcels to collect propagules over 1 year. Propagules were segregated and germinate at greenhouse. Species richness and abundance were estimated, and variance and similarity were quantified. In total, 86 species were recorded in the seed banks, 41.9% natives and 33.7% exotics, with the predominance of herbs (87.2%) and only 7% of trees. Species classified as weeds amounted to 52.3%. In the seed rain 642 seedlings germinated but they belonged to only 10 species, half of them were exotics. Regarding life forms, half of the species were arboreal and dominated the samples, highlighting the exotic species Melia azedarach. The species richness of the seed bank did not differ by season, unlike the seed rain which varied significantly by month. Seed bank and seed rain species had a very low floristic similarity with the list of planted species, suggesting that few planted trees had dispersed or were stocking propagules. Many non-planted species were recorded, mostly exotics and/or invasive that were probably derived from the surrounding urban matrix. These might interrupt the successional dynamics of the restoration forest and compromise the restoration process in the medium and long-terms. Our results highlight: (1) the importance of monitoring areas undergoing restoration; (2) that restoration methods and management actions directed to control exotic and invasive species are particularly important for sites in urban regions; and (3) the relevance of conserving forest fragments as sources of propagules for nearby areas.

TI  - Tree species for agroforestry enrichment of monoculture of Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess in a floodplain
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - To restore degraded floodplains with agroforestry systems (AFS), more ecological knowledge about native species is needed. This research aimed to evaluate the survival, growth, and biomass input of native trees planted and managed in an AFS to enrich a monoculture of Calophyllum brasiliense . The findings, which are encouraging for the future of agroforestry, revealed that available light did not limit survival and growth in these groups. The pioneers grew faster, although the greatest height was in Sesbania virgata , Schinus terebinthifolius , Handroanthus impetiginosus , Inga vera and Citharexylum myrianthum . However, the higher relative growth rates indicate that E. verna , P. grandiflorum , and Anadenanthera colubrina have grown more in the last 15 months than S. virgata . The three species with the largest canopy radius were S. terebinthifolius , I. vera and C. myrianthum , the most significant contribution of the phytomass supply during pruning was from S. virgata and S. terebinthifolius . Euterpe edulis and S. virgata intercropping supported the palm tree in overcoming climatic extremes between the lines of C. brasiliense . This research highlights the potential of AFS to innovate for a sustainable agricultural and forestry production future that aligns with ecological restoration requirements.

TI  - Abundance and phenology drive plant-pollinator network responses to restoration in the Southern Atlantic rainforest in Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has been increasingly considering biotic interactions. Different restoration strategies usually rely on different composition and abundance of plants with potential impact on the establishment of plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the restoration of plant-pollinator interaction networks in young restoration areas in the South Atlantic rainforest, Brazil. We assessed the relative contribution of two restoration strategies (natural regeneration vs. reforestation), geographic distance, plant composition, pollinator composition, abundance of flowers and insects, and plant-pollinator temporal overlap, that is, phenological coupling, to predict the establishment of pairwise interactions. We expected that restoration strategies would indirectly affect the patterns (identity and frequency) of pairwise interactions due to their influence on the processes driving interactions. We sampled monthly pollinators and the plants they visited on six reforestation sites and six natural regeneration sites during 20 months. We surveyed flower abundance in summer. We analyzed the relative contribution of each factor to predict the identity and frequency of pairwise interactions using structural equation modeling. Contrary to expectations, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions, probably because the sites under restoration were surrounded by natural and conserved landscapes. Since we found no effect of restoration strategies on plant composition, abundance, and phenological coupling, the restoration strategy did not predict interactions. Phenological coupling explained more than half of the interaction patterns, representing the best predictor of interactions followed by abundance and plant composition. Therefore, these predictors should be considered to select plant species in restoration projects that encompass interactions and pollination services.

TI  - Degradation by coal mining should be priority in restoration planning
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southern part of the Atlantic Forest region, in Santa Catarina, Brazil, coal mining has led to severe degradation, with former mining areas abandoned decades ago without any concern about environmental and social damage. Up to recently, little restoration activity had been developed, despite severe and ongoing environmental degradation that also causes risks to human health. We argue that these areas should be made restoration priority, and that the development of specific restoration actions and measures for sites like these are urgent. To achieve effective restoration planning we must overcome some challenges, such as prioritization of areas for restoration, establishment long-term monitoring, development of realistic goals, avoidance of the use of invasive grasses, and inclusion of human population and their needs into discussion of restoration goals and approached. We recognize that, due to pollution and contamination problems, cost for restoration is a massive challenge in the region, but even higher costs for population and environment are expected if sites would not be restored. Considering the environment and human health risks of areas degraded by coal mining, restoration efforts should be of high priority on all level of governance, and ways should be found to include this into the procedures for prioritization of restoration activities.

TI  - Litterfall, seed size, and predator-free time window enhance survival of a keystone palm in an Atlantic forest restored site
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although enrichment planting is recommended to increase biodiversity in restoration, environmental filters can prevent the establishment of sowed/planted species. Euterpe edulis is a keystone palm in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, whose fruits are consumed by many animals. We assessed the viability of direct seeding of this palm in an Atlantic forest restored site in Southeast Brazil, guided by these questions: 1) Does germinability vary among seeds covered and uncovered by litterfall and according to litterfall depth? 2) Can direct seeding be impaired by seed predation? 3) Does seed size affect seed predation and seedling vigor? We found litterfall favored germination by reducing soil evaporation, but litterfall depth did not affect germination. Seed predation was low, as seed location was probably unpredictable to rodents. Smaller seeds were more removed, possibly because the larger ones impose transportation costs on small rodents. By removing the smaller seeds, predators may favor the production of larger and more vigorous seedlings. Direct seeding of E. edulis can be successful if implemented in medium regeneration stages of Atlantic forest sites, where shade and moisture provided by litterfall, and absence of mid-to large-sized seed predators, allow seeds to overcome the constraints on germination and predation.

TI  - Participatory construction in agroforestry systems in family farming: ways for the agroecological transition in Brazil
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to analyze the implementation of Agroforestry Systems (AFS) by family farmers, assessing their contribution to agroecological transition and understanding the process of knowledge construction. The study was carried out in family farming farms in the Sumare Rural Settlement, and in the area of Family Farming and Agroecological Cooperative (Cooperacra), respectively located in the municipalities of Sumare and Americana, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The methodology was based on a case study, using Focal Groups and Field Notes as research instruments. On the basis of our analysis, there were social changes in the farmers' organization and in the decision-making process, as well as in the landscape in the areas of AFS and surroundings, where agroecological principles were also applied to production. In Sumare, the four farmers participating in the project organized themselves to obtain organic certification. Cooperacra, which works with a group of 10 farmers advanced in the process of agroecological transition, starting from an intensive organic horticulture production system to a biodiverse agroforestry system. Despite the short time of the project, the construction of knowledge in relation to agroforestry systems was perceived through management techniques incorporated by the farmers in their agroecosystems. The arboreal component, which thus far the farmers had seen as something to be eliminated to realize agriculture, was introduced and became a relevant part of the process. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of AFS in the process of agroecological transition toward a more sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Shading effects on community composition and food web structure of a deforested pasture stream: Evidences from a field experiment in Brazil
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Experimental manipulations in the field can evidence cause-effect relations from the manipulated variables. In this context, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of shading on stream community composition and food web structure. The experiment was conducted in two reaches of a pasture stream: one that remained open (control) and another that was covered with 75% factor shading cloth (treatment), sampled before and after 21 months. At each sampling, algae, macrophytes, plankton, meiofauna, macroinvertebrates, and fish were collected. All heterotrophic organisms were submitted to diet analysis and dietary data was used to calculate food web parameters. Community composition was evaluated through cluster analysis. A total of 7556 individuals of 148 taxa were identified. The control reach presented lower richness, abundance, and food web parameter values than the treated reach before shading cloth installation, whereas after the experiment the opposite was observed. Despite these differences, both reaches had changed over the experimental period for being under increased siltation as a result of long term land use effects, which resulted in higher similarity of community composition between periods than between treatments. This observation was corroborated by higher food web complexity before the experiment, with decreases in all food web parameters (except connectance) after 21 months, especially in the treated reach. Hence, decreases in community attributes and food web parameters after the experiment evidenced the effects of siltation, while the strongest decreases observed at the treated reach evidenced the effects of shading. Finally, we stress that the artificial shading itself does not promote allochthonous materials inputs (which add up to food web basis and promote habitat heterogeneity), so full-canopy riparian forest restoration is of fundamental importance for low-order streams.

TI  - FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF ENRICHMENT MODEL USING TIMBER AND NON-TIMBER PRODUCTS OF SECONDARY REMNANTS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-economic aspects can limit the expansion of ecological restoration. One alternative to address this question is the development of restoration models that generate income to farmers in addition to the benefits from conservation itself. We designed and implemented the initiative "Sustenta A Mata," a project developed by The Nature Conservancy and supported by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), to generate economic and social benefits for the communities involved. This study aims to analyze the financial viability of the enrichment restoration initiative in forest remnants based on a 30 year projection. The project was implemented on 17 hectares of land that included timber and non-timber species with a focus on the Jucara Palm (Euterpe edulis Mart.) for the production of fruit. Estimated earnings come from both the production of timber and jucara fruits. We considered input, equipment and labor costs for implementation, maintenance, and harvesting. For the economic analysis we used the following criteria: Net Present Value (NPV); Return on Investment (ROI); Benefit/Cost Ratio (B/C), and Payback. From these indicators the following values were obtained as results: US$4,040.80 of NPV, 13 percent of ROI, 1.59 of B/C and a 13-year Payback. These positive results for the aforementioned indicators reveal that the use of the enrichment restoration initiatives utilized in this project may contribute to the economic viability of the endeavor, contributing to a greater sustainability in rural areas.

TI  - Seed bank of mining tailings as indicator of vegetation regeneration in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The soil seed bank is one of the most important ecological indicators for evaluating and monitoring the resilience of degraded ecosystems. Likewise, ecological restoration indicators are currently used in areas affected by the rupture of the Fundao tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Objective: To evaluate the seed bank at two depths of areas affected by mining tailings, Mariana municipality, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: 15 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected per level of depth, in the upper layer (Depth1, P-1 = 0-2.5 cm), and lower layer (Depth2, P-2 = 2.5-5.0 cm) of the mining tailings to survey the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for germination and seedling identification. The samples were placed in plastic trays to germinate in the nursery, then counted and identified weekly for six months. Results: The results showed that there is a seed bank in the surface layers of accumulated mining tailings in the affected areas of Mariana, with a marked difference between depths in terms of species richness and density of individuals. Higher species richness and number of individuals were observed in P-1, (1 165 germinated seeds), belonging to 18 families and 47 species, in comparison to P-2 (197 individuals), belonging to 12 families and 23 species. Probably the seed bank of layer P-1 is influenced by the rain of seeds from the nearby forest. On the other hand, the P-2 seed bank can be characteristic of mining tailings. Conclusions: Seed bank patterns can have positive effects on forest resilience at the local-scale, due to the high proportion of native, pioneer and anemochorical species of early successional stages.

TI  - Planting designs and functional traits of native plant species used in restoration projects in araucaria forests
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Araucaria forest (AF) is one of the most devastated vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest, with a high percentage of areas to be restored. The purpose of this study was to compare two planting models in areas of AF and to determine functional attributes of four native species for ecological restoration - Schinus terebinthifolius, Psidium cattleianum, Eugenia involucrata, and Ocotea odorifera. The study compared the survival, initial growth, canopy cover, and ground cover throughout 18 months between systematic planting models (pioneer species interspaced with non-pioneer species in the same planting row) and random models (pioneer and non-pioneer species randomly distributed within the plots). The functional attributes assessed were average height growth, survival, susceptibility to frost, canopy diameter, and frequency of herbivory. There were no differences in survival, initial growth, and canopy cover of plants between the planting models. Schinus terebinthifolius presented 87% of the desirable attributes to use in restoration projects in AF with high rates of survival and growth (height growth and canopy diameter). The non-pioneer species had a survival rate of 50% or lower and are not recommended for joint planting with the pioneer species for implementation during the frost season in AF.

TI  - Restoring tropical forests on lands mined for bauxite: Examples from the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in Epigaeic Ant Assemblage Structure in the Amazon during Successional Processes after Bauxite Mining
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental impact studies often involve monitoring and using bioindicators to evaluate the restoration stage of impacted areas. We aimed to assess ant assemblages' response to the ecological succession of previously disturbed areas in the Brazilian Amazon. We sampled epigeic ant assemblages in five bauxite mining areas, representing different restoration stages, and compared them with two pristine areas. We also compared trends in species richness at the same mine site investigated 14 years earlier. Ten pitfall traps and four Winkler samples of litter were taken along a 100-m transect in each area. We expected that ant species richness would increase with the amelioration in habitat condition (i.e., environmental surrogates of ecological succession, including litter depth, soil penetrability, the circumference of trees, the distance of trees to adjacent trees, and percentage of ground cover). We also compared the efficacy of both sampling methods. Due to more significant sampling effort, pitfall traps captured more ant species than Winkler sacks. However, Winkler samples' addition allowed the collection of more cryptic species than by pitfall traps alone. We sampled a total of 129 ant species, with increases in ant species richness in more mature rehabilitation. Nevertheless, similarity analysis indicated a significant difference between ant assemblages of rehabilitated areas and pristine ones. Assemblages differed mainly by the presence of specialist and rare species, found only in pristine plots. Rehabilitated areas exhibited a significant increase in tree circumference as they reached more ecologically advanced stages, which contributed to increasing ant species richness. These trends and comparison with the earlier study indicate that although there are favorable increases in ant species richness, in terms of species composition, rehabilitated areas were far from achieving an ant assemblage composition or environmental status that closely resembles pristine areas.

TI  - Arthropod Recolonization in the Restoration of a Semideciduous Forest in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of arthropods for monitoring habitat changes has grown widely in the last decades. In Brazil, however, most of the studies in restored areas have involved only vegetation changes. The present study aimed at investigating recolonization patterns of epigeic arthropods in recently restored sites of semideciduous forests in southeastern Brazil. We compared the community structure of adjoining sites 5, 17, 29 and 36 months old with that at a nearby forest remnant (reference site). We also determined the most abundant species and looked for ecological indicator species of each site age. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, and their assemblages were described and compared with multi- and univariate statistical methods. Species abundance and richness equivalent to the reference site were reached at five months after planting, however species composition was very distinctive not only in relation to the reference site, but also among restored sites. Some of the main species found in this restoration stage are common in agroecosystems or cerrado vegetation. Nevertheless, there was a clear trend of arthropod fauna in restored sites moving toward the fauna in the forest remnant over time. Our results also highlighted ants and termites because of their abundance and ants because of their high value as ecological indicators of restoration age.

TI  - Influence of Removal of a Non-native Tree Species Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. on the Regenerating Plant Communities in a Tropical Semideciduous Forest Under Restoration in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits. In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation systems (modified "taungya" agroforestry system; and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species) established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in So Paulo state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height a parts per thousand yen0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M. caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area. Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings.

TI  - Seed germination of Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae) submitted to different dormancy breaking treatments
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE BOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Myrsine coriacea (Sw.) R.Br. ex Roem. & Schult. is a tree species with nucleation characteristics and a target to frugivorous animals, which contributes to the seed deposition to other plants. M. coriacea seeds remain in the soil for long periods, regenerating the forest after natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Four different methods were analysed with the aim to verify different types of breaking seed dormancy: Control (TC); Chemical Scarification (TQ); Mechanical Scarification (TM); Thermal Scarification (TT). The following parameters were evaluated, percentage of germination (PG) (%), germination speed index (IVG), and mean time of germination (TMG) (days). For all the parameters, we found that TM was more efficient at promoting germination, because it increased the percentage and speed of germination, which was observed with more seeds germinating in a short period of time. Meanwhile no difference was noticed between TC and TT, and the TQ was deleterious and is not recommended to break seed dormancy.

T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Brazil's Cerrado, a biodiversity-rich biome, has faced significant exploitation and degradation. Restoration projects aim to revive native plant communities, highlighting Eremanthus incanus, an endangered pioneering tree vital for colonizing disturbed Campo Rupestre areas but threatened by commercial use. Our objective was to evaluate the efficiency of different exotic grass control methods to promote the natural regeneration of E. incanus in a Cerrado. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block design (n = 3). The treatments were crowning the seedlings with herbicide, crowning the seedlings with a coastal brush cutter, and control with herbicide in the total area, crowning the seedlings with a hoe. These forms of control were combined with maintaining or removing straw and fertilizing or not fertilizing the seedlings. Additionally, we had a control treatment without interventions and another with fertilization of seedlings. At 15 months after the application of the procedures, we evaluated the percentage of ingress, survival, increment in height, and diameter at ground height (DGH) of E. incanus individuals. Straw removal treatments promoted a higher percentage of individual entry, regardless of the form of control used. Fertilization had no effect on E. incanus survival in straw removal plots. Weeding with a brush cutter enhanced seedling height and DGH, while herbicide application and crowning with a hoe, combined with straw removal, effectively controlled invasive grasses and improved E. incanus establishment and survival. Control and management of invasive grasses improve the biological conditions of the sites and facilitate the establishment and growth of E. incanus seedlings.

TI  - Photochemical attributes determine the responses of plant species from different functional groups of ferruginous outcrops when grown in iron mining substrates
T2  - FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environments originating from banded iron formations, such as the canga, are important reference ecosystems for the recovery of degraded areas by mining. The objective of this work was to evaluate if the relationship between morphofunctional and photosynthetic attributes of native canga species from different functional group results in distinct responses when grown in iron mining tailings substrate. The experiment was carried out with species belonging to different functional groups: a widespread semi-deciduous tree-shrub, Myrcia splendens; an endemic deciduous shrub, Jacaranda caroba; and a nitrogen-fixing herbaceous species, Periandra mediterranea. The species were grown in two conditions, reference soil and iron ore tailing. Despite belonging to different functional groups when grown in tailings, the morphofunctional attributes presented similar responses between species. M. splendens was the species most affected by the conditions imposed by the iron ore mining tailings, with decreased light-use efficiency and electron transport. P. mediterranea had satisfactory growth and maintenance of photosynthetic attributes. J. caroba growing in the tailings increased the effective quantum yield of PSII. The photochemical and growth assessments were able to better explain the adaptive strategies developed by the species, guaranteeing a greater chance of success during the rehabilitation of mining substrates.

TI  - STRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS OF FLORISTIC GROUPS IN TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine floristic groups of the shrub-tree vegetation strata of an excerpt from Forest Subtropical Deciduous slope in Parque Estadual Quarta Colonia, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to analyze their structure and to determine key environmental factors for plant species occurrence, in order to provide restoration programs of of degraded areas as reference ecosystem. A phytosociological survey was carried out for vegetation analysis on 12 plots of 200 m(2) (10 x 20 m), systematically distributed on a topography gradient at 20 m interval, systematically distributed on four tracks of 100 m between them, following the gradient of topography. In each plot, it species was identified and it was measured circumference at breast height (CAP) and overall height of tree individuals, represented by those with CAP >= 115 cm, named upper stratum. Understory strata information was obtained on circular plots of a radius of 1.78 m, set up in the center of 10 x 20 m plots, from individuals with height >= 30 and CAP < 15 cm. Environmental variables were steepness, light intensity and soil chemistry and texture. Data analyses of vegetation structure and diversity were evaluated by using TWINSPAN and environmental correlations of floristic composition by using CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis). It was identified two groups, with species composition belonging to different stages of natural succession, suggesting differences of agricultural land use history and soil chemical characteristics. For that, some species may be indicated in forest restoration programs.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF SOIL FACTORS ON THE FLORISTIC VARIATIONS OF A SECTION OF RIPARIAN FOREST IN THE RIVER GUALAXO DO NORTE, MARIANA, MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this was to investigate the correlation between the distribution of tree species of the riparian forest of Gualaxo do Norte river (S20 degrees 16'31.9" W43 degrees 26'15.3" and S20 degrees 16'30.6" W43 degrees 26'07.3") with soil factors and to find if there are species of occurrence restricted to depletion of riparian forests that can be indicated for recovery of riparian forest. The plots were allocated in 1-ha divided into three blocks with different steepness. All of the individuals with a trunk circumference at 1.30m above ground equal to or greater than 15 cm were recorded and identified. Five simple samples of soil were collected in each plot for fertility chemical analysis. The ordination of the soil and vegetation data was made by the analysis of canonical correspondence (CCA) that indicated that variations in the chemical fertility, acidity of the soil and height were influencing the distribution of the tree vegetation over the topographical gradient. Albizia hassleri, Bathysa meridionalis, Cariniana estrelensis, Casearia gossypiosperma, Casearia sp., Cecropia hololeuca, Himatanthus lancifolius, Luehea grandiflora, Picramnia sp., Platypodium elegans, Pseudopiptadenia contorta, Tibouchina candoleana and Virola oleifera are species adapted to soil conditions with high acidity and very low fertility, presenting potential for use in projects of recovery of degraded areas, mainly of hillsides and top of hills. Already Casearia sylvestris, Dalbergia villosa, Dendropanax cuneatus, Machaerium aculeatum, Machaerium stiptatum, Ocotea odor fera, Ocotea pulchella, Rollinea longifolia, Schinus terebinthifolius, Tibouchina granulosa, Vernonia piptocarphoides and Vismia sp. are correlated with soils less acid, more fertile and closer to the river, presenting potential for the forest restoration in riparian zones.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION OF 'COQUEIRAL' ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AREA, IN COQUEIRAL, MINAS GERAIS STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the forest fragmentation of Coqueiral Environmental Protected Area (APA Coqueiral), located in Coqueiral, South region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the forest fragmentation of Coqueiral APA, using landscape metrics, as well as, elaborating landscape simulation models to provide future scenarios of ecological restoration, and then, to compare these simulations to the current landscape. Land use analyses were carried out through Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing techniques, using a SPOT 5 satellite image (SPOTMAP). Forest fragmentation was analysed by FRAGSTATS software for calculating landscape metrics such as: area, perimeter, shape, and, patch connectivity. We performed 1 and 5 m buffers maps, and a virtual restoration of the Permanent Protected Areas (APP) for landscape simulations. Landscape fragmentation analyses showed that natural vegetation is distributed within 360 patches, being 137 of them smaller than 1 ha. Landscape simulation models revealed that natural vegetation has increased from 1943.13 ha to 2299.02 ha in the restored APP simulation (natural vegetation/restored APPs = VA). The average patch size increased from 7.66 m to 15.75 m in the same simulation in comparison to the current landscape. VA showed a smaller shape value (1.93), indicating that patch shape is simpler in this simulation. This is an important result from the conservation point of view, because as simpler a shape of a patch is, smaller the edge effect is. Isolation values were not statistically different in the simulations: 38.9 m (VN); 40.64 m (VB1); 42.89 m (VB5) e 39.75 m (VA), what indicates low isolation between patches, even in the current landscape. Connectivity index was high (99%) for all simulations, indicating that landscapes have high structural connectivity. These data are relevant inputs to decision makers and to a better planning and management of the APA Coqueiral, allowing us to indicate the priority areas for conservation in this natural reserve.

TI  - Managed logging negatively affects the density and abundance of some dry forest specialist bird species of northeastern Brazil
T2  - ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes, allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long (similar to 25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil, focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12 forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species. Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities, suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.

TI  - Challenges and directions for open ecosystems biodiversity restoration: An overview of the techniques applied for Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration of tropical open ecosystems remains challenging for both science and practice. Over the last decade, innovative techniques have been developed, but whether they have been successful or not remains to be demonstrated. Assessing the outcomes of these initiatives is crucial to drive the following steps to improve tropical grasslands and savanna restoration.Analysing 82 data sets from the literature and primary data collection, we assessed the effectiveness of passive and active restoration techniques applied in Cerrado open ecosystems. We used plant diversity variables (species and growth forms) as indicators, considering ruderals and exotics as non-target species. Specifically, we aimed to answer: (i) How does the diversity of target species change through time in areas subject to passive restoration? (ii) Are active and passive restoration techniques effective in restoring the proportion of target species found in old-growth reference ecosystems? (iii) Have the current techniques been successful in recovering the proportions of growth forms of reference ecosystems?We found that target species proportions do not increase with time, suggesting limitations of typical species to colonise degraded sites. Hence, passive restoration will promote the conservation of a limited and constant number of target species. This number will depend on the magnitude of degradation and previous land use.The restoration techniques currently applied to restore the biodiversity of Cerrado open ecosystems are not reaching the reference standards, with distinct techniques driving plant communities to different sets of growth forms. Active restoration based on propagules obtained from pristine donor sites (topsoil translocation, plant material transplant, and seeding) performed better than passive restoration for most of the growth forms analysed.Synthesis and applications: Different growth forms have different roles in determining the structure and functioning of Cerrado vegetation. A mix of techniques can better approximate plant diversity and the proportionality of target species of pristine ecosystems. Singular restoration approaches are insufficient for restoring Cerrado open ecosystem biodiversity. Mixed efforts encompassing various techniques are required instead. Furthermore, it is likely restoration success can be improved with greater investment in improving our understanding of, and developing existing restoration techniques.

TI  - The potential conservation value of anthropogenically modified habitat for the Endangered moor macaque Macaca maura in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced land-use change has resulted in substantial loss and degradation of habitat for forest-dwelling wildlife. The moor macaque Macaca maura, an Endangered primate endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia, has been observed in a wide array of habitats, including heavily modified areas, but little is known about the quality of these habitats. Here we compared the habitat quality of two areas occupied by moor macaque populations: a previously human-modified karst forest now located within a national park and a heavily modified forest located in an unprotected area. We assessed habitat quality by measuring specific indicators of potential food availability derived from vegetation data and quantified the nutritional environment based on macronutrient analysis of fruit samples collected at the two sites. Although the species richness, diversity and overall stem density of macaque food trees were greater in the protected area forest, total basal area and mean diameter at breast height were greater in the heavily modified forest. Mean metabolizable energy concentrations of fruits eaten by macaques were similar between forests, as were the proportions of protein, lipids and total non-structural carbohydrates. These results provide further support for the notion that heavily modified habitats should not be overlooked for their potential conservation value. To further augment their value, conservation efforts should focus on forest restoration, specifically the planting of fast-growing species that are utilized by both wildlife and people.

TI  - Edaphic Filters and Plant Colonization in a Mine Revegetated with Sewage Sludge
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the recruitment of plant species and their relation with edaphic attributes in a mine revegetated with sewage sludge in the Brazilian Federal District. Plant species in the revegetated mine and in remaining portions of Cerrado (savanna) within the mined landscape were sampled and identified. Then, samples of revegetated substrate and soils from Cerrado portions were collected, analyzed for chemical attributes and submitted to statistical tests. Results indicated that the remaining portions of Cerrado were colonized by 91 species (22% allochthonous species), and the revegetated substrate housed 62 species (55% allochthonous species). Multivariate tests showed that the edaphic condition built from the incorporation of sewage sludge into the mining substrate acted as filter on the assemblage of plant species. Despite the two study sites shared the same landscape, the Cerrado portions and the revegetated substrate did not share similar plant communities after a decade from mine rehabilitation works.

TI  - The effects of two abundant ant species on soil nutrients and seedling recruitment in Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ants can influence soil fertility and the spatial distribution of seeds, with possible effects on seedling recruitment. The ant species Pachycondyla striata Fr. Smith, 1858 and Odontomachus chelifer (Latreille, 1802) co-occur in many forest areas in the Neotropics. We assessed soil fertility and seed bank structure in soil samples close and distant (control) from ant nests in forest fragments. We also assessed the richness and abundance of seedlings on nests and control sites. In soil samples from ant nests, the concentration of phosphorus and potassium were respectively 55.6% and 36% higher than in control sites. Aluminium was 11-15% lower in soil samples from ant nests. In the greenhouse, soils from ant nests had higher plant abundance and species richness, but the same species composition in comparison with control sites. Although more plants emerged from soil samples of O. chelifer nests, in the field, the density and richness of seedlings were similar for the two ant species studied. Seedlings in the nest sites were, on average, 1.8 times more abundant and 1.6 times richer in species than in control sites. Our results showed that ant species can play a key role in seedling recruitment in forest fragments, where other animals with equivalent and positive effects, such as mammals, are missing.

TI  - Soil Seed Banks in a Forest Under Restoration and in a Reference Ecosystem in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aims to characterize the soil seed banks in a forest under restoration and in a seasonal semideciduous forest remnant, as well as to quantitatively and qualitatively compare them in order to evaluate the seed bank potential to influence the restoration process. In total, 60 samples of soil seed banks were collected in two adjacent forests (30 in a 2.18-ha forest undergoing restoration process based on the planting of seedlings belonging to different tree species, after the forest was subjected to bauxite mining activity; and 30 in a 5.30-ha preserved forest fragment). The soil seed bank of the forest undergoing restoration recorded higher density of emerged seedlings than that of the reference ecosystem. Although the shrub-tree species in the investigated forests lacked floristic similarity, the highly similar dispersal syndrome distribution and the successional category of shrub-tree species in them have indicated that both forests underwent ecological processes. Therefore, the restoration process implemented in the mined area has successfully recovered the soil seed bank after a few years.

TI  - Productivity constraints on Citron-crested Cockatoos in a rich community of large hole-nesting birds
T2  - AVIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of breeding success and its limiting factors is crucial in assessing species' conservation needs. As cavity-nesters, parrots are particularly influenced by the availability of suitable cavities and low breeding output, whether due to natural processes or trapping. On the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the Critically Endangered Citron-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua citrinocristata) has the added problem of co-existing with an unusually rich hole nesting bird community in a forested environment much constrained by habitat loss. We monitored 95 nesting cavities of cockatoos and their competitors and potential nest-predators, over one to four breeding seasons, using a combination of camera-traps, direct checks on nest contents, and observations from the ground. Competition for suitable cavities was intense among three large parrot species, two owls and a hornbill. Visitation rates by potential competitors were higher at unoccupied cavities than at those containing active nests, reflecting the guarding behaviour of the occupants. The Endangered Sumba Hornbill (Rhyticeros everetti) dominated observed direct confrontations and was the most frequent visitor to active parrot nests, suggesting a further role as a potential nest-predator. Cockatoos prospected many cavities but rarely then attempted to nest: instead the sites were usually occupied by other cavity-nesters, or by bees. At the few cavities where cockatoos did breed, predation pressure was likely low, and observed success rate high (10 successful of 15 nests), although the low number of nests found early in the breeding cycle suggests that some may have failed before detection. Intense competition for cavities suggests a shortage of suitable nest-sites, the need for preservation of old hole-bearing trees and a role for nestboxes. Accessible, known, safe artificial nest-sites would also provide opportunities to assess the scale of nest-site shortage, allow camera placements to study productivity, exclude some competitors and predators, and prevent illegal trapping. Especially given continued trapping pressure, the species would benefit from targeted local awareness-raising and law enforcement, with the whole endeavour backed up by longer-term forest restoration.

TI  - Ecological restoration, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation: The experience of the society for wildlife research and environmental education (SPVS) in the Atlantic Rain Forest of southern Brazil
T2  - Journal for Nature Conservation (Jena)
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1999, SPVS has been involved in three projects that combine two fundamental.goals over the course of 40 years: the conservation of one of Brazil's most important remnants of Atlantic Forest and the implementation of projects for carbon sequestration. In addition, there is an interest in replicating these projects in order to restore other degraded areas, protect the Brazilian biomes, and help to diminish deforestation and forest fire, therefore reducing carbon emissions. The acquisition of 19,000 ha of degraded areas of high biological importance in southern Brazil was the first step towards the implementation of the projects. These areas are owned by SPVS, a Brazilian NGO, and are being restored, conserved and transformed into Private Natural Reserves, in partnership with the NGO - The Nature Conservancy, and financed by the companies - American Electric Power, General Motors and Chevron Texaco. The process of forest restoration involves several stages: soil studies, surveying the region's native plants, planning for restoration by means of a Geographical Information System, production of seedlings, application of different techniques for planting (such as manual. or mechanised planting with seedlings and stakes), and biomass and biodiversity monitoring. To guarantee the survival of the seedlings on the planted areas, during the first three years, there is a continuous and systematic maintenance programme including weeding of undergrowth, crowing and organic fertilisation. The three projects already planted around 500,000 seedlings of native species until September 2004, and aim to plant a further 300,000 until 2008. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All. rights reserved.

TI  - Natural regeneration in a restored bauxite mine in southeast Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to verify if, in floristic terms of natural regeneration, a restored bauxite mine in southeast Brazil can be considered successfully restored. Forty plots of 3.0 x 3.0 m were allocated in the area. All shrubs and trees with height >= 0.30 m and diameter at 1.30 m height (DBH) <= 5.0 cm were identified and classified into successional categories and dispersal syndromes; DSL (diameter at soil level) and height were measured. We use the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to verify the correlations between environmental variables (canopy openness, litter decomposition, soil penetration resistance) and vegetation. We found 705 individuals, 80 species and 30 families. The families with the highest species richness were Fabaceae and Melastomataceae. The specie with the highest importance value (IV) was Myrcia splendens. Most species are the early secondary successional category and the zoochoric dispersion syndrome. CCA ordination indicates the formation of a group of species associated with less soil compaction and with low litter decomposition rate and the formation of another group associated with intermediate values of soil penetration resistance and litter decomposition rate. The results obtained after ten years of implementation of the restoration project, in floristic terms, are suitable. In other words, the area can be considered as successfully restored.

TI  - Carbon stock estimate using indirect methods in a forest restoration area in Minas Gerais State
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to estimate and compare the carbon stock obtained from three indirect methods in a reforested area of 21 years in southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Forest inventory data (diameter and height) from permanent plots, measured between 2010 and 2013, were used to estimate the biomass (dry weight) using an allometric equation. Basic wood density (BWD) and carbon content were only determined for species with high ecological importance. Carbon stock was obtained by three indirect methods: multiplying dry biomass (DB) by the carbon content (M1) obtained through laboratory analysis; multiplying the DB by the factor 0.5 (M2); and use of an allometric equation (M3). The species with the lowest and highest carbon content were Lafoensia vandelliana (43.70%) and Anadenanthera peregrina (46.60%). As for the BWD, the species that showed the lowest and highest value were Cecropia pachystachya (0.31 g cm(-3)) and Anadenanthera peregrina (0.72 g cm(-3)). Carbon stocks obtained by methods 1, 2, and 3 were 49.73 t ha(-1); 55.65 t ha(-1) and 54.70 t ha(-1), respectively. The using an allometric equation and generic carbon content overestimated the carbon stock in the studied area. Thus, the use of carbon content determined in laboratory improved the accuracy estimation of the carbon stock.

TI  - Intensive silvicultural practices drive the forest restoration in southern Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of degraded environments is a challenging process due to the presence of adverse factors, which can prevent the establishment and development of forest species. The use of appropriate methods and species, which are able to adapt to the soil and climatic conditions, enable successful conservation plantings. Herein, we aim to identify the performance of native forest species grown under two planting models and different silvicultural practices in a degraded riparian area in the extreme south of the Atlantic Forest Biome. The experiment was initiated in September 2015 with a randomized block design arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial scheme (three silvicultural practices and two planting models). We evaluated the performance of nine native species by the analysis of morphological (i.e., survival, height, and stem diameter) and physiological attributes (i.e., photosynthetic pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence). The use of intensive silvicultural practices in restoration plantations maximized tree survival rates, height, and stem growth, and provided better values for the physiological attributes. The two planting models tested in this study (i.e., "framework species" and diversity) can be used in future restoration projects in subtropical regions associated with intensive silvicultural practices. Solanum mauritianum, among other studied species, presented excellent rates of survival and growth. Several secondary species (e.g., Actinostemon concolor, Trichilia elegans, and Eugenia rostrifolia) propagated from the seedling transplants, also showed the potential to enrich forest plantations in degraded environments.

TI  - Simulation of soil losses according to environmental adequacy law scenarios in agricultural catchments
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sao Paulo state, deforestation and agriculture activities are increasing soil losses processes, especially in areas of susceptible soils where soil conservation practices are not adopted. Environmental adequacy at property level regarding Permanent Protection Areas and Legal Reserves is considered a potential factor for reducing soil losses and it was based on this fact that we assessed soil losses of different scenarios of environmental adequacy. Simulations of erosive processes were carried out in 15 catchments of the Corumbatai river basin, with different forest restoration scenarios, as well as the current situation of land use/land cover. The scenarios include reforestation of Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA); the reforestation hydrological sensitive areas; and two scenarios, the Legal Reserve installation in 20% of each catchment, being one of them for most critical areas in terms of erosion and the other at random. It was observed that the establishment of PPA and the reforestation of hydrological sensitive areas (HSA), offered a small contribution to the control of the erosive process, resulting in a reduction of 10% and 7.4%, respectively, while the legal reserve in critical areas has the significant reduction of 69.8%. The random scenario, in turn, resulted in a reduction of 21.4% of erosion. Results show that reforestation can reduce soil losses, but previous studies of land prioritization and planning could significantly increase its efficiency.

TI  - Modeling landscape dynamics in an Atlantic Rainforest region: Implications for conservation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The dynamics of the Atlantic Rainforest loss and recovery are still not fully understood despite its long history of human occupation. In this study, we investigated changes in an Atlantic Rainforest region due to major biophysical and human proximate causes. First, we modeled land-cover and land-use changes from 1962 to 2000, including deforestation and forest regrowth, and thereby simulated future landscape trajectories to assess their possible effects on the conservation of forest species of the lbiuna Plateau, a region located in Southeastern Brazil within the Atlantic Rainforest biome. We modeled four scenarios (status quo, random, law enforcement, and land-use intensification) and simulated their resulting landscape trajectories for the year 2019 using DINAMICA. The landscape dynamics in the study region were particularly intense. During the first period of 1962-1981, the rate of forest regrowth (3% year(-1)) was greater than the rate of deforestation (2% year(-1)), whereas in the latter period of 1981-2000, increasing urbanization and the spreading of rural establishments resulted in more deforestation (2.9% year(-1)) than regrowth (1% year(-1)). These dynamics imprinted a heterogeneous landscape, leading to the predominance of progressively younger secondary forests with increasingly less capacity of hosting sensitive forest species. The influence of proximate causes on the dynamics of deforestation and forest regrowth showed consistent patterns, such as higher forest regrowth rates near rivers, on steep slopes and far from dirt roads, whereas losses in young secondary vegetation and forest were far from rivers, on gentle slopes and near urban areas. Of the modeled scenarios, only the law enforcement scenario may lead to the recovery of a network of interconnected forest patches, suggesting that simply the enforcement of current forest laws, which prohibit deforestation on unsuitable agricultural areas and along river margins and establish a minimum of 20% of forest remnant per rural property, may effectively favor forest species conservation in the short term (two decades) without the need of any forest restoration effort.

TI  - EFFECT OF LIGHT AND DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES ON GERMINATION OF Heliocarpus popayanensis L. SEEDS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heliocarpus popayanensis is a pioneer tree species used in Brazil mainly for forest restoration. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of light and temperature on the germination of H. popayanensis seeds. Seeds were put to germinate inside transparent and black plastic boxes and incubated in chambers at 25 degrees C for light evaluation on germination. For temperature evaluation, nine intervals of constant temperatures between 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C and two alternate temperatures (15-35 degrees C and 20-30 degrees C) were analyzed in thermo-gradient table. For both experiments, seeds were distributed on the top of two blotter paper sheets and the daily photoperiod was eight hours of light. Germination was evaluated from primary root protrusion and formation of normal seedlings, and three lots of seeds were studied. The results showed that H. popayanensis seeds are non-photoblastic, the optimum temperature interval is between 28.1 degrees C and 30.2 degrees C, temperatures around 35 degrees C stimulated seed impermeability overcome, and the primary root protrusion was not efficient to determine the optimum germination temperature, since the formation of normal seedlings is more indicated for this determination.

TI  - Soil erosion as a function of different agricultural land use in Rio de Janeiro
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated erosion in the mountainous agricultural area of Rio de Janeiro has caused significant environmental degradation and financial loss. Consequently, quantifying and analyzing soil erosion under different agricultural systems in the region is essential for adoption of specific and effective soil conservation practices. Gerlach-type runoff-erosion plots were used to collect runoff and measure sediment yield from four different land management areas (olericulture with conventional tillage, pasture, forest restoration system and native rainforest). Physicochemical analyses, soil profile description and permeability assays were employed to reveal the erosive processes. Soil water retention curves were used to infer soil pore size distribution, which affects permeability and runoff. We observed that erosion increases with conventional tillage practices, as was revealed in the experimental olericulture plot, where erosion of 14,779 kg ha(-1) was measured in the period of March 2008-January 2009, compared with only 4.5 kg ha(-1) in the pasture plot in the same period, mainly because of the decrease in soil particle cohesion and infiltration in association with poor vegetation cover.

TI  - Aboveground biomass accumulation and tree size distribution in seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests undergoing restoration can present high biomass accumulation rates, especially in the first 20 years. However, native species reforestations often present a bias toward fast growth, low wood density, and small maximum adult size species, contrasting with most mature forest species. Since tree species adult size and wood density are key traits that influence biomass accumulation, these induce uncertainty regarding carbon uptake capabilities of restoration projects in the long term. We compared the density of individuals (DI), basal area (BA), aboveground biomass (AGB), and weighted average wood density (WDW) in 13-14-year-old restoration sites and in mature seasonal Atlantic Forest fragments. We also assessed the contribution of pioneer and non-pioneer and planted and non-planted species on these variables at restoration sites. Furthermore, we investigated the DI and WDW for saplings and seedlings, in order to foresee changes in forest structure that may result from natural recruitment of dense-wood mature species. The BA and WDW at restoration sites were similar to forest fragments, except for large trees (DBH >= 50 cm). Restoration sites recovered AGB to the level of forest fragments only for the smaller size class (DBH 5-19.9 cm). Planted pioneer and non-pioneer species accumulated the greatest AGB (93%), BA (94%), and DI (90%) at restoration sites. The DI of non-planted non-pioneer species with higher WDW increased among saplings and seedlings at restoration sites. The presence of species with a larger adult size and higher WD may indicate long-term increase in biomass accumulation at restoration sites.

TI  - Implementation of riverside parks in the city of Sao Paulo - progress and constraints
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental degradation of urban rivers and streams in large cities has led to the development of a variety of public policies. In the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, a policy for recovering watercourses and valley floors has been developed with the implementation of riverside parks. This represents a new paradigm for the city in terms of its relationship with rivers and streams. This paper presents the results of an exploratory study, which aimed to analyse riverside parks in the city of Sao Paulo during the last decade. The study analysed the main management difficulties in relation to these types of urban park during their post-implementation stage, assessing their performance in relation to their social and environmental functions. It addressed issues such as the state of the site before and after the implementation of the riverside park, levels of user satisfaction in relation to the state of the watercourse, sports and leisure facilities, green space, security and the way the park is used. The study showed that riverside parks are recognised as elements that improve the quality of public spaces, socially legitimised as public policies.

TI  - Controlling the invader Urochloa decumbens: Subsidies for ecological restoration in subtropical Campos grassland
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Restoration of grassy biomes is currently of large importance, and controlling invasive grasses is often key to restoring these ecosystems in the tropics and subtropics. We combined different ecological restoration techniques to evaluate potential to control the invasive grass Urochloa decumbens and restore plant species composition. Specific questions were: (a) are herbicide application and topsoil removal efficient to control U. decumbens cover and allow native species establishment; and (b) are hay transfer and sowing native grass species efficient to reintroduce native species and increase their cover? Location Campos grasslands, southern Brazil. Methods We combined the follow restoration techniques: (a) herbicide application or topsoil removal to control the invasive species, and (b) hay transfer or sowing of native grasses to reintroduce native species. We assessed and compared native plant species richness, vegetation cover, native species cover, U. decumbens cover and other exotic species cover in 2016 and 2017. Results Herbicide application reduced invasive species cover more than topsoil removal, even though both were effective. The decrease of U. decumbens cover led to an increase in native species cover and native species richness. Hay transfer and sowing native grasses did not produce satisfactory results for native species reintroduction. Native species richness and U. decumbens cover increased from 2016 to 2017. Conclusion Herbicide application was a better option to control U. decumbens and to allow recovery of native species. However, use of herbicides in restoration is controversial, and more detailed studies on impacts are necessary. Environmental filters appear to be a major cause for failure of hay transfer and seeding species. Recovery of the native plant community is a great challenge in invaded subtropical grasslands, and additional management actions and time are necessary to increase the establishment of native species.

TI  - Ecological Relationships between Layers of a 40-year-old Restored Area in Vicosa, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological relationships between different layers of a restored area in Vicosa, State of Minas Gerais. A floristic survey of the tree layer, natural regeneration and soil seed bank was carried out. The floristic composition between layers of the restored area (tree layer, regeneration and seed bank) was compared, and this composition was also compared to various forest fragments in the area; the comparisons were made through cluster analysis. The successional class and dispersion syndrome between layers of the restored area were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The dendrogram obtained distinguished the seed bank of the other layers. There was no similarity between the area studied and the forest fragments in Vicosa. In the distribution by successional class and dispersal syndrome, there was significant difference between the seed bank and other layers of the restored area. Results evinced the discrepancy of the seed bank floristic compared to other layers of the forest, proving that the forest area is in a headmost stage of succession.

TI  - Forest restoration with Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze on Campos do Jordao state park, SP: fire effects on tree and shrub structure
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration actions aimed at Mixed Ombrophilous Forests are limited due to the scarce knowledge about composition and structure of these communities on different successional stages, and also the effects of frequent disturbances on its dynamics, such as fire. The present work aimed at evaluating the effect of an accidental fire on the horizontal, vertical and diametric structure of an Araucaria angustifolia planted forest, located on Campos do Jordao State Park, SP, nine years after the disturbance. This study also intends to appraise the potential of these forests on inducing the secondary succession. Two Araucaria angustifolia forests were selected, with similar ages and environmental conditions, called Forests RI and Rh. On RI, there's no account of fire since its planting, in 1959 (control). RII, which was planted in 1958, was affected by an accidental fire in July 2001. During the upper strata survey (circumference at breast height (CBH) >= 15cm), 17 and 8 permanent plots of 10x20m were established on forests RI and RII, respectively. In each one of these plots five sub-plots of 1x1m were randomly chosen, in order to survey the lower strata (total height >= 30cm and CBH < 15cm). In forest RI, 836 trees and shrubs were surveyed, while on forest Rh I 175 individuals were sampled. Forest RI presented significantly higher values than II for density on both strata and dominance on upper strata (absolute totals). The diametric structure follows an inverted J-pattern in both areas. Nevertheless, the fire seems to significantly have reduced the number of individuals of the first diameter classes. Forest RII seems to still express the effect of burning, which was more severe in the lower strata; in case the above hypothesis is correct. However, due to favorable landscape conditions, we hope that both forests continue their natural succession, resembling the surrounding forest matrix in the long term.

TI  - Restoration plantings of non-pioneer tree species in open fields, young secondary forests, and rubber plantations in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forest of Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot that retains less than 12% of its original area. In this biome, non-pioneer tree species with limited dispersal are the most impacted by recent habitat loss and fragmentation. As attempts to establish non-pioneer tree species in pastures and agricultural fields in the Atlantic forest have failed, restoration strategies that consider planting these species in other habitats, such as the understory of secondary forests and tree plantations may be more successful. To test this, five native non-pioneer tree species (Sloanea obtusifolia, Garcinia macrophylla, Copaifera lucens, Symphonia globulifera, and Pouteria reticulata) were planted in complete randomized blocks in April 2009, with four site replications and four treatments (open fields, open fields with pioneers, young secondary forests, and rubber plantations). Survival, height, and dbh (diameter at the breast height) were measured every year for six years. We also measured canopy cover and soil physical and chemical parameters. Six years after planting, we found similar survival of non-pioneer tree species in open fields, young secondary forests and within rubber plantations. However, height and dbh growth were, in general, significantly higher in open fields. Planting pioneer species in mixture with non-pioneers did not improve the growth of non-pioneers. We also found differences among species, with Copaifera lucens showing higher survival and growth than the other species. Even though enriched young secondary forests and rubber plantations could be important contributors to biodiversity conservation, higher growth rates of non-pioneer species in open fields have the benefit of accelerating the recovery of wildlife activity in restoration plantings.

TI  - Litter and soil arthropod colonization in reforested semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic forests
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recovery of soil ecological processes during the restoration of tropical forests is greatly influenced by arthropods that live in the litter and soil. However, these communities present complex dynamics, and their colonization patterns are not well understood. In this study, we examined the response patterns of litter and soil arthropods to the ecosystem regeneration process by assessing reforestation sites from two regions of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and we compared the data obtained from these sites with data from mature forests. We assessed the arthropod communities using similarity indices and high-level taxa abundance, with the level of forest succession and the locations of the restoration areas as factors. Forest succession correlated with the species composition as communities from the reforestation sites gradually became more similar to communities from the mature forests, while their quantitative patterns were minimally related. Forest maturation positively affected the richness of the litter community and the abundance of some minor groups, such as Protura, Diplura, and Symphyla. The region influenced the species composition but did not influence the manner in which the communities changed during the maturation process. We also found a convergent soil colonization pattern as arthropod communities from different sites became more similar during forest succession. This finding is consistent with both empirical data and theoretical predictions from the specialized literature, although the subject has been poorly explored until now. We conclude that reforestation allows the colonization of soil and litter fauna in a biased manner.

TI  - Can restoration based on incorporating harvested freshwater macrophytes into degraded soils increase ground coverage, floristic richness, and diversity within a year at a site in southern Brazil?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This large-scale field study evaluates emerging vegetation 1 year after incorporating 374 m(3) of macrophyte biomass into the soil in a degraded area in Southern Brazil. We tested whether treatments using this technique led to (1) higher floristic richness and diversity and (2) higher coverage and dominance by species different from areas without macrophyte soil incorporation, identifying the species that characterize the initial recovery process. The restoration treatments utilizing macrophytes led to significant increases in species richness and diversity as identified in the structural analysis, reaching almost twice the number of plant species in adjacent areas degraded for longer and with no intervention. The absolute cover increased by 50 and 76% for the doses of 50 and 100 m(3)/ha, respectively, compared to the treatment without macrophyte incorporation, achieving similar values to an adjacent degraded area with no recent degradation, surpassing 100%. The structurally most important species Dichanthelium sabulorum, Calopogonium mucunoides, Baccharis dracunculifolia, Paspalum exaltatum, and Cyperus lanceolatus also presented frequencies higher than 90% in all treatments, underscoring their predominant characteristics as colonizers of degraded areas and similar ones with potential to test for replication in restoration projects in the region. Among these species, we intentionally sowed only C. mucunoides, while the others demonstrate natural colonization through propagules in the region or from the phytomass of the incorporated macrophytes. This approach provides a distinct advantage over other treatments by improving our understanding of the potential of different types of colonizers at the site during initial restoration.

TI  - No Effect of Variations in Overstory Diversity and Phylogenetic Distance on Early Performance of Enrichment Planted Seedlings in Restoration Plantations
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Enrichment planting is a strategy to increase tree diversity and reintroduce desirable species in restored forests, mainly in fragmented landscapes. However, the conditions that improve the performance of enrichment planted seedlings are not yet fully known. Here, we evaluate the role that overstory taxonomic diversity and mean overstory to seedling phylogenetic distance have as predictors of early performance of native tree seedlings planted beneath mixed-species restoration plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. By applying a phylogenetic approach, our study responds to recent calls for testing the application of such tools in restoration. We planted 12 mid- to late-successional species beneath a mixed-species restoration plantation with three nested tree diversity levels of 19, 58, and 107 species and estimated the mean phylogenetic distance between each seedling species and the overstory community. Seedling performance was not significantly affected by overstory diversity or mean phylogenetic distance. Overall good performance of the seedlings shows that enrichment planting beneath a mixed-species overstory can be successful even under variations in overstory species number and phylogenetic distance. However, significant species-specific differences in performance highlight the importance of an informed selection of which species to enrich plant.

TI  - Ecological methods and indicators for recovering and monitoring ecosystems after mining: A global literature review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mining contributes significantly to the world's economy. However, it brings strong environmental impacts, including the destruction of the original vegetation. In this way, the recovery of degraded areas by mining has been a mandatory procedure in many countries. With the objective to review this subject, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using scientific articles published in the period 1990-2018. A total of 700 articles in 171 journals were sampled. Ecological Engineering and Restoration Ecology were the journals with the largest number of articles. There was a significant increase of articles along time approaching the use of geotechnologies and arbuscular fungi. Recovered or recovering ecosystems were studied in 45 countries, mainly in Brazil, Australia, USA, China, and Spain. Coal and bauxite were the most common resources mined. The most frequent recovery methods were: seedling planting, direct seeding, natural regeneration, and hydroseeding, with techniques employed in some of them. In 35.71% of the articles, a small number of species (2-5) were used for the initial plant's establishment. The number of articles decreased as the number of both, plant species used in the initial recovery phase, and ecosystem's age increased. In monitoring, the most important indicators were classified as functional or functional plus structural. From the functional indicators, the Technosols or rebuilt soils were the most evaluated. Future perspectives on forests recovery includes methods tailored to peculiar features (soil and economic) of each ecosystem. For the forest recovery monitoring, the use of geotechnologies, mainly the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as well as wildlife indicators tend to increase rapidly.

TI  - Opportunities and risk management of peat restoration in Indonesia: lessons learned from peat restoration actors
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant efforts have been invested to restore degraded peatlands in Indonesia considering the high mitigation potential as an effective natural climate solution. However, peat restoration in Indonesia faces challenges such as suboptimal planning and risk management. In this study, we assessed the national potential peat restoration area using spatial analysis and identified the associated risks based on lessons learned from past restoration efforts. We estimated the extent of potential restoration areas by analyzing canal networks, burnt areas, and critical land maps at the national scale. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, followed by a national workshop with relevant stakeholders to assess the potential risks and develop risk management strategies for peat restoration. Our analysis estimated 6 Mha, or 45% of Indonesia's total peatland area, as potentially restorable areas for rewetting and/or revegetation efforts. Of this potential area, 50% falls under concession holder management. The identified risks consisted of technical (39%), management (38%), social (17%), and economic (6%) factors, with 15 and 22% classified as extreme and high risk, respectively. Policymakers can use these findings to strengthen regulations and improve the chances of successful restoration implementation, supporting Indonesia's emissions reduction target and providing economic benefits for restoration actors.

TI  - Future environmental and agricultural impacts of Brazil's Forest Code
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of improving the enforcement of Brazil's Forest Code in reducing deforestation in the Amazon has been highlighted in many studies. However, in a context of strong political pressure for loosening environmental protections, the future impacts of a nationwide implementation of the Forest Code on both environment and agriculture remain poorly understood. Here, we present a spatially explicit assessment of Brazil's 2012 Forest Code through the year 2050; specifically, we use a partial equilibrium economic model that provides a globally consistent national modeling framework with detailed representation of the agricultural sector and spatially explicit land-use change. We test for the combined or isolated impacts of the different measures of the Forest Code, including deforestation control and obligatory forest restoration with or without environmental reserve quotas. Our results show that, if rigorously enforced, the Forest Code could prevent a net loss of 53.4 million hectares (Mha) of forest and native vegetation by 2050, 43.1 Mha (81%) of which are in the Amazon alone. The control of illegal deforestation promotes the largest environmental benefits, but the obligatory restoration of illegally deforested areas creates 12.9Mha of new forested area. Environmental reserve quotas further protect 5.8Mha of undisturbed natural vegetation. Compared to a scenario without the Forest Code, by 2050, cropland area is only reduced by 4% and the cattle herd by 8%. Our results show that compliance with the Forest Code requires an increase in cattle productivity of 56% over four decades, with a combination of a higher use of supplements and an adoption of semi-intensive pasture management. We estimate that the enforcement of the Forest Code could contribute up to 1.03 PgCO(2)e to the ambitious GHG emissions reduction target set by Brazil for 2030.

AB  - The aim of this study was to indicate species to restore riverine forest environments. We used classification methods that seek to group sets of individuals with similar characteristics, defining clusters based on floristic composition. For this, a 1-hectare area of vegetation was inventoried in a stretch of riverine forest in Sant'Ana do Livramento, Rio Grande do Sul. In this area we measured and identified the arboreal and shrub individuals with DBH >= 5 cm. In the vegetation three floristic groups were found, and for the environmental recovery of disturbed areas with similar environmental characteristics, it was suggested the use of Ocotea acutifolia (Nees) Mez, Pouteria salicifolia (Spreng.) Radlk., Gymnanthes klotzschiana Mull. Arg., Eugenia uniflora L., Allophylus edulis (A.St.-Hil. et al.) Hieron. ex Niederl., Blepharocalyx salicifolius (Kunth) O. Berg, Prunus myrtifolia (L.) Urb., Scutia buxifolia Reissek, Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez, and Styrax leprosus Hook. & Am.

TI  - Nitrogen Pools in Tropical Plantations of N2-Fixing and Non-N2-Fixing Legume Trees under Different Tree Stand Densities
T2  - NITROGEN
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the nitrogen pools in monocultures of legume species widely used in reforestation in Brazil that have contrasting growth and nitrogen acquisition strategies. The plantations were established with the slow-growing and N-2-fixing tree Anadenanthera peregrina var. peregrina, and the fast-growing and non-fixing tree Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum. The measurements of N pools in the tree biomass and the soil followed standard methods and were carried out on 54 experimental plots. The N-2 fixation pools were evaluated by abundance natural of N-15 and the N accretion methods. The soil N content was of similar magnitude between species and stand densities. The species showed similar amounts of N in the biomass, but divergent patterns of N accumulation, as well as the N-15 signature on the leaves. S. parahyba accumulated most N in the stem, while A. peregrina accumulated N in the roots and leaves. However, the N accumulation in biomass of A. peregrina stand was less constrained by environment than in S. parahyba stands. The percentage of N derived from N-2 fixation in A. peregrina stands decreased with the increase of stand density. The biological N-2 fixation estimates depended on the method and the response of tree species to environment.

TI  - Harnessing the synergy of Urochloa brizantha and Amazonian Dark Earth microbiomes for enhanced pasture recovery
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile soils from the Amazon rainforest that harbor microorganisms with biotechnological potential. This study aimed to investigate the individual and potential synergistic effects of a 2% portion of ADEs and Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu roots (Brazil's most common grass species used for pastures) on soil prokaryotic communities and overall soil attributes in degraded soil. We conducted a comprehensive plant succession experiment in the greenhouse, utilizing vase soil samples for next-generation sequencing of 16 S rDNA, enzymatic activity assays, and soil chemical properties analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to understand better the prokaryotic interactions within soil environments influenced by ADEs and U. brizantha roots, including differential abundance, diversity, and network analyses. Our findings reveal a complementary relationship between U. brizantha and ADEs, each contributing to distinct positive aspects of soil bacterial communities and quality. The combined influence of U. brizantha roots and ADEs exhibited synergies that enhanced prokaryotic diversity and enzyme activity. This balance supported plant growth and increased the general availability of beneficial bacteria in the soil, such as Chujaibacter and Curtobacterium while reducing the presence of potentially pathogenic taxa. This research provided valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of plant-soil feedback, emphasizing the potential for complementary interactions between specific plant species and unique soil environments like ADEs. The findings highlight the potential for pasture ecological rehabilitation and underscore the benefits of integrating plant and soil management strategies to optimize soil characteristics.

T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon frontier shows how remarkable leadership can work towards increased agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability without new greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to initiatives among various stakeholders, including national and state government and agents, farmers, consumers, funding agencies and non-governmental organizations. Change has come both from bottom-up and top-down actions of these stakeholders, providing leadership, financing and monitoring to foster environmental sustainability and agricultural growth. Goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land-cover and land-use change in Brazil are being achieved through a multi-tiered approach that includes policies to reduce deforestation and initiatives for forest restoration, as well as increased and diversified agricultural production, intensified ranching and innovations in agricultural management. Here, we address opportunities for the Brazilian Amazon in working towards low-carbon rural development and environmentally sustainable landscapes.

TI  - Passive Restoration in Biodiversity Hotspots: Consequences for an Atlantic Rainforest Lizard Taxocene
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term conservation in biodiversity hotspots depends on the recovery of communities in secondary forest fragments. In most cases, however, recovery strategies for these areas are based only on passive restoration. It is therefore necessary to determine the efficiency of such strategies. In this study, we assess the efficiency of passive restoration on a 567-ha 28-yr-old fragment of Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil. We measured richness, composition, abundance and biomass of a lizard taxocene and also vegetation structure and availability of several microhabitat descriptors in 18 plots of this secondary forest. We then compared them with measures in 29 plots from two neighboring reference sites. Species richness, abundance, biomass and microhabitat descriptors availability inside the secondary fragment did not differ from reference sites. However, composition and vegetation structure showed small differences. Some forest specialist lizards, which should be a focus of conservation efforts in fragmented landscapes of the Atlantic Rainforest, were not found in the fragment and data indicate that this was not due to sampling or a lack of suitable habitat or microhabitat. In the presence of preserved source sites, passive restoration may be a cheap and effective way to recover lizard taxocenes of the Atlantic Rainforest. Some of the species may need to be re-introduced to accelerate the full recovery of original composition of lizard taxocenes in secondary Atlantic Rainforests.

TI  - Seedling production of Ceiba speciosa in different volume of tubes using biosolids as substrate
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the problems encountered in the formation of stands aimed at forest restoration is the quality of the seedlings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the different volumes of tubes for the seedling production of Ceiba speciosa, using biosolids as a substrate. The experiment consisted of the seedlings production stage and evaluation of the performance in the field. The treatments were the tubes of 55, 110, 180 and 280 cm(3). Both phases of this experiment were installed in a completely randomized design, with the stage of seedling production composed by four repetitions of 12 plants, and field stage composed by 20 seedlings from each treatment, with height and diameter closer to the average for the last assessment carried out in the nursery. Using biosolids as the main component of the substrate for the production of Ceiba speciosa seedlings, and for the site conditions where the forest stand was implanted, it is recommended to use the 110 m(3) tube, because in this tube occurred growth similar to plants in the tubes of larger volumes, resulting in lower volume of substrate, smaller area occupied in the seed-plot and greater ease of transport and handling.

TI  - Role of Tree Vegetation and Associated Environmental Factors on the Understory Herb-Layer Composition in a Reforested Area: A Study from "Kulon Progo Community Forestry"
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the understory herb-layer species composition in response to tree vegetation and its associated environmental factors in the reforested area of the Kulon Progo Community Forestry, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The understory herb-layer composition among different stand types, including Pinus (PN), Aleurites-Swietenia (AS), Swietenia-Acacia (SA), Melaleuca-Acacia (MA) and Tectona-Dalbergia (TD), was compared using some comparison analyses. The influence of tree vegetation characteristics and associated environmental factors on the understory herb-layer species was analyzed by employing canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Our result showed variation in understory herb-layer species composition despite equality in richness and diversity indices. Among all stand types, the MA stand showed fewer shade-tolerant species, and the TD stand exhibited the smallest number of shade-intolerant species. Seedling availability also varied between AS and MA, which contained fewer seedling species. One of the main species in the two stands did not even regenerate. Moreover, all indicator species in MA were shade-intolerant species with invasive characteristics, while those in TD were shade-tolerant and semi-shade-tolerant species. CCA showed that stand types held an important role in the herb-layer species composition, where the number of shade-tolerant and seedling species commonly native to forest were directly proportional to tree canopy coverage, silt proportion in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon yet inversely proportional to below-stand utilization. In contrast, the number of shade-intolerant species had positive correlation to below-stand utilization and inversely to other correlated factors. Our study also indicated the possibility of tree vegetation controlling several environmental factors, where the increase in canopy coverage was followed by an increasing proportion of silt in soil texture and concentration of soil organic carbon, as well as a decreasing percentage of below-stand utilization. Accordingly, we recommend tree species enrichment with dense-canopy trees and adaptive management of below-stand utilization for better forest development and tree regeneration. This finding provides important knowledge for evaluation and improvement in the ecological restoration of degraded forests.

TI  - Use of artificial perches for wild birds in a degraded area in southern Brazil
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - . One of the major setbacks in environmental restoration is how to promote the arrival of propagules in degraded areas, and this issue is intensified at sites without vegetation, where natural dispersal is limited. To overcome this issue, one of the methods employed is the use of artificial perches, intended for attracting seeddispersing birds, providing perching sites, and thus, facilitating the formation of vegetation nuclei from the seeds that are excreted, regurgitated, or accidentally dropped. The aim of this study was to quantify and identify the birds that used the artificial perches in a degraded area on the margins of the Forqueta River, RS, Brazil, in order to evaluate their effectiveness as an ecological restoration method. Over one year, 11 bird species were observed to use the perches. Despite the presence of birds, there was no significant seed germination at the base of the perches. Absence of frugivorous species and adverse conditions of the soil might have contributed to this result. Previous studies showed diverging results on the effectiveness of artificial perches, indicating the need for considering several factors, such as availability of food resources and the presence of invasive species. The present study highlights the complexity of ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded areas and the importance of adaptive approaches to reach effective results.

TI  - The role of very small fragments in conserving genetic diversity of a common tree in a hyper fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest landscape
T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In hyper fragmented biomes, conservation of extant biota relies on preservation and proper management of remnants. The maintenance of genetic diversity and functional connectivity in a landscape context is probably key to long-term conservation of remnant populations. We measured the genetic diversity in seedlings and adults of tree Copaifera langsdorffii and evaluated whether edge and density-dependent effects drive natural regeneration in a set of very small and degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragments. We evaluated the role of small remnants in the conservation of genetic diversity in a hyper fragmented landscape and discuss the challenge of long-term population sustainability of such altered habitats. High genetic diversity in adults indicated these fragments are valuable targets for C. langsdorffii in situ conservation, but both genetic diversity and divergence among patches decreased in seedlings. In our landscape, regeneration increased as it neared edges and adults; suggesting this population is resilient to fragmentation. However, at a broader scale, current levels of gene flow have not been sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic diversity across generations. Restoration plans, even at a small scale, are necessary to promote fragment connectivity and spatially expand opportunities for the fairly restricted gene flow observed in this severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest region.

TI  - What is the Long-Term Effect of Bamboo Dominance on Adult Trees in the Araucaria Forest? A Comparative Analysis between Two Successional Stages in Southern Brazil
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboos are opportunistic species that rapidly colonize open areas following forest disturbance, forming dense clusters that alter the regenerative processes and maintain lower levels of tree diversity. Widespread forest degradation, especially in Latin America and Asia, and human-induced introduction have allowed native and non-native bamboo species to thrive, hindering successional pathways that would otherwise lead to more diverse forests; such a large-scale phenomenon is a key concern in the conservation of forest resources around the globe. Despite previous research on this phenomenon, little is known about the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on forest structure and composition and the corresponding interaction with natural regeneration. As such, we sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on the dynamics of adult forest populations considering two forest types (Bamboo Forest-BF and Araucaria Forest-AF) over an 11-year period in the Embrapa Research Station in Cacador, Brazil. We monitored 20 plots (15 x 15 m) in each forest type where we tagged, identified, and measured the height and diameter of all the trees taller than 1.5 m (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 3.18 cm. Comparisons were based on forest species diversity and structure parameters. In BF, diversity of species increased after the bamboo die-off that occurred in 2006 with a subsequent reduction in the number of pioneer species overtime. However, secondary species remained stagnant demonstrating that recruitment and transition into higher size classes is restricted to the immediate die-off aftermath. On the other hand, plant diversity and structure in the relatively bamboo-free AF were stable with secondary species accounting for the most richness. Our results confirm that BF maintains significantly lower levels of diversity that are restricted to pioneer species; AF structure and diversity are not significantly affected by bamboo die-off and recolonization; and BF tree species are caught in a closed cycle of arrested successional development. The widespread presence of bamboos as dominant species in the region should become a part of the conversation pertaining to forest management and conservation in Brazil and other countries in south America and Asia.

TI  - Monitoring the effect of restoration measures in Indonesian peatlands by radar satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the ongoing climate change discussions the importance of peatlands as carbon stores is increasingly recognised in the public. Drainage, deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands. Successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential. The blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes. This study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures. The study area is the former Mega Rice Project area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense. Restoration measures started in July 2004 by building 30 large dams until June 2008. We applied change detection analysis with more than 80 ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images, acquired between 2004 and 2009. Radar signal increases of up to 1.36 dB show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction, especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cross-polarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above -50 cm was found. Monitoring peatland rewetting and quantifying groundwater level variations is important information for vegetation re-establishment, fire hazard warning and making carbon emission mitigation tradable under the voluntary carbon market or REDO (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism.

TI  - Urban Floods in Lowlands-Levee Systems, Unplanned Urban Growth and River Restoration Alternative: A Case Study in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of cities has always had a very close relation with water. However, cities directly impact land use patterns and greatly change natural landscapes, aggravating floods. Considering this situation, this paper intends to discuss lowland occupation and city sustainability in what regards urban stormwater management, fluvial space, and river restoration, aiming at minimizing flood risks and improving natural and built environment conditions. River plains tend to be attractive places for a city to grow. From ancient times, levees have been used to protect lowland areas along major watercourses to allow their occupation. However, urban rivers demand space for temporary flood storage. From a systemic point of view, levees along extensive river reaches act as canalization works, limiting river connectivity with flood plains, rising water levels, increasing overtopping risks and transferring floods downstream. Departing from this discussion, four case studies in the Iguacu-Sarapui River Basin, a lowland area of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, are used to compose a perspective in which the central point refers to the need of respecting watershed limits and giving space to rivers. Different aspects of low-lying city planning are discussed and analyzed concerning the integration of the built and natural environments.

TI  - Can transplanting seedlings with protection against herbivory be a cost-effective restoration strategy for seasonally flooded environments?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Transplantation of naturally regenerating seedlings (hereafter wildlings) has great potential as a restoration tool as it involves the use of acclimatized individuals and preservation of local and endemic genotypes. When successfully used, this technique has the added benefits of increasing structural and compositional diversity, pre serving local and endemic genotypes, and reducing ecological restoration costs. In wetland ecosystems, flooding is an abiotic filter that may hinder success of restoration efforts. We hypothesized that transplanting "ecologically toughened" wildlings from low-lying, flooded areas into restoration areas of higher relief and lower frequency of flooding, would be a successful strategy. In this study, we transplanted wildlings from periodically flooded areas upslope to test the effect of topographic position (where they were collected and outplanted), and protection against herbivory on seedling survival and growth. The experimental design included two collection times and planting areas (high and low topography), two seedling height, use of protection against mammalian herbivory, and four species that represent different functional types. We also evaluated the costs involved. The best experimental outcome for the four study species (most abundance floodplain species) was found with small seedlings (10-39 cm) collected at low relief and outplanted to higher elevations, with protection against herbivory. Even under unusually extreme flood events (high flooding over 7 months) the tree legume Inga vera has emerged with the highest survival rate. The costs of transplantation are lower (USD 739 ha(-1)) than those found in previous studies and the use of protection against herbivory was also considerably low (USD 2484 ha(-1)). That said, these estimated costs are on an experimental scale and do not represent large-scale operations, which could reduce and improve cost-benefits significantly. In remote places such as the Pantanal, the lack of nursery infrastructure, high associated costs of seedling production and vulnerability to herbivory are the main challenges for restoration. Hence, wildling collection can be a useful strategy to overcome such obstacles.

TI  - Improvement of vegetation structure enhances bird functional traits and habitat resilience in an area of ongoing restoration in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is a traditional option for recovering biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Birds perform pollination, seed dispersal, and pest-control services, which catalyze increases in habitat structure. Habitat complexity changes bird composition, but there is little evidence of its effects on bird functional diversity in Neotropical restorations. We tested whether bird functional diversity and composition respond to increased habitat complexity. Point-counts were performed (January-December 2015) in an area undergoing restoration (536 ha) in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, in restorations with less and more structured vegetation and pastures and forest-fragments. The functional bird traits considered were diet, habitat, biomass, environmental sensitivity, and foraging strata. Increased habitat complexity was evaluated using plant characteristics (exotic grass, canopy, herbaceous cover, and diameter at breast height). A total of 172 bird species (5% endemic; 12% migratory) were recorded. Increased vegetation structure in both restored sites and forest-fragments drove a reorganization and addition of functional bird traits, which positively influenced functional richness, dispersion, and evenness. Shifts in plant-characteristics rearranged bird functional traits (diet-forest-dependence and diet-strata-foraging). The rapid development of vegetation structure is a key factor for restoration because it provides additional habitat for semi-dependent forest birds and enhances resilience and sustainability in new man-made forests.

TI  - Poor Performance of Corals Transplanted onto Substrates of Short Durability
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, coral reefs are degrading due to increasing anthropogenic pressures. Yet, management of reefs still falls short of effectively addressing these threats, and active restoration methods are increasingly being called for. Coral transplantation is frequently advocated as a possible means of coral reef rehabilitation. Fragments produced in coral nurseries or farms have been proposed as a potential source for transplantation, and culture media (inexpensive but non-durable materials such as wood or bamboo) may serve as transplantation substrate if placed directly in the reef. However, the performance of coral transplants attached to such substrates has not been examined yet. Here, the long-term survival of transplants attached to bamboo substrates is reported. A total of 6,164 fragments of 4 coral species (Acroporids and Pocilloporids) were monitored for up to 20 months at three sites in North Sulawesi/Indonesia. Bamboo failed as a suitable inexpensive substrate in at least two of the three sites examined. Mortality of transplants 2 years after transplantation was high in three of the four species (67-95%) and was partially linked to substrate disintegration. The results show that, in places were currents or waves threaten to dislocate transplants, a higher effort needs to be directed at a strong and durable attachment of transplanted corals.

TI  - Diversity enhancement of a forest under restoration through direct seeding of lianas
T2  - Hoehnea
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of direct seeding of liana species in the understory of a restoring forest. Seeds of the species Phanera sp., Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) A.H. Gentry, and Peltastes peltatus (Veil.) Woodson were submitted to germination tests considering the presence and absence of light and temperature cycle variation. These species were also planted under a canopy of four tree species in a 21-year-old restored forest in Iracemapolis, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Macfadyena unguis-cati was the only species presenting a positive photoblastic characteristic, while the two other tested species were not affected by light or temperature cycle. In the understory, Peltastes peltatus did not emerge. In the two other species, seed germination was not influenced by the selected tree species. These results suggest that despite the low rate of emergence, it is possible to enhance the diversity of forest by restoring it through direct seeding of some liana species.

TI  - New records and modelling the impacts of climate change on the black-tailed marmosets
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change represents an unprecedented threat to global biodiversity and, for many species, gaps in our knowledge of their biology remain acute. Gaps in baseline knowledge, such as confirmed identifications (Linnean shortfalls) and adequate collections (Wallacean shortfalls), need to be minimized with new studies, since this is often critical for effective conservation. Despite the increase in scientific research on primates in the southwest of the Brazilian Amazon, little is known about the species Mico nigriceps (Ferrari & Lopes, 1992) Primates, Platirryni. In the current study, we sought to reduce the extent of the Wallacean shortfall for M. nigriceps, understand whether climate change represents a threat to the distribution of the species, and identify priority areas for its conservation. Accordingly, we provide 121 new records in 14 locations, obtained directly from the field, and five from the literature. Using this, we carried out ecological niche modeling, to better understand how environmental suitability might limit the area occupied by the species. We then projected a distribution for 2070 with the SSP2-4.5 (more optimistic) and SSP5-8.5 (more pessimistic) scenarios. Our data confirmed the geographic distribution of the species as being restricted to headwaters of the Ji-Parana/Machado river, but with a 400 km extension to the south. Under the modeled climate change scenarios, the area suitable for the species declines by 21% under the most optimistic, and by 27% in the pessimistic, scenario across the projected 50-year period. Although we have expanded the area of known occurrence for this species, we point out that climate change threatens the stability of this newly-discovered population strongly, and that this danger is intensified by deforestation, fire and hunting. We recommend that further studies be carried out to confirm the presence of the species in adjacent areas, those indicated by generated models as being potential environmentally suitable. In addition, we recommend intensifying forest restoration in currently pastured areas, and protection of the areas forming the current and future habitat of this species through such measures as protected area creation.

TI  - Native remnants can be sources of plants and topsoil to restore dry and wet cerrado grasslands
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neotropical grasslands have undergone intensive degradation by land conversion or biological invasion, but their restoration is still challenging. Here, we integrated two approaches to (1) assess the resilience of pristine dry and wet cerrado grasslands after removal of plants and topsoil and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments based on the material extracted from pristine grasslands to restore degraded dry and wet grasslands after pine invasion. We used old-growth cerrado grasslands in southeastern Brazil as donor ecosystems and assessed their resilience after the removal of all plants and the upper 5-cm soil layer. To restore both wet and dry grasslands, we tested topsoil translocation, plant transplantation, direct seeding, topsoil translocation + direct seeding, and needle layer removal. Both wet and dry grasslands were resilient to plants and topsoil removal, as evidenced by their fast recovery. The major mechanisms promoting resilience were seed germination in the wet grasslands and resprouting from underground organs in the dry grasslands. Transplantation was the most successful treatment to restore vegetation cover, species richness, and composition in both wet and dry grasslands, especially for herbaceous species. Restoration of the herbaceous layer of cerrado grasslands can be successful using natural ecosystems as donor sites without impairing their resilience in the studied scale. Improving the resilience of degraded dry and wet cerrado grasslands depends on reestablishing the condition to seed germination in the wet grasslands and reintroducing species with the ability to resprout after disturbance in the dry grasslands, attributes that explained the quick recovery of the donor ecosystems.

TI  - On- and off-site erosion impacts of restoration measures in a tropical karst watershed
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst areas are vulnerable landscapes which, if unprotected, could be permanently degraded. To bridge the gap existing in the reduction of on- and off-site impact of restored tropical karst areas, this study was carried out in a 3.5 ha karst watershed of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). Precipitation, surface runoff, and soil loss were measured in representative runoff plots (22.1 x 1.84 m), used to assess the watershed erosion and sediment yield to a downstream sinkhole. The study was carried out during three hydrologic years, between September 2018 and May 2020. The predominant soils in the watershed were Lithic entisol and Quartzsamment, and the original land covers were natural savanna, seasonal forest, and degraded pastureland (Andropogon gayanus). The latter was restored with native savanna species, in the lower part of the watershed, and with a reformed pastureland, in the upper part. The USLE rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), and soil cover (C) factors, runoff, soil loss, and the original soil and sediment textures were obtained from the runoff plots. The watershed soil loss and sediment yield were obtained by the USLE and GIS. Precipitation and rainfall erosivity ranged from 936 to 1223 mm, and from 6694 to 7746 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1), in the period, respectively. Although the ecological watershed restoration reduced mean soil loss from 11.6 to 5.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), and sediment yield from 29.2 to 14.6 Mg year(-1), on- and off-site soil loss tolerances were still exceeded in 29 and 61% of the basin area, respectively. Ecological restoration also reduced the sand and clay content of the sediment entering the underground caves and river downstream, contributing to their hydrologic sustainability.

TI  - Enhancing ecological connectivity through biodiversity offsets to mitigate impacts on habitats of large mammals in tropical forest environments
T2  - IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are ecological impacts of development projects known to have severe effects on mammals' populations. Here, we study the role of connectivity assessment in Environmental Impact Assessment, focusing on its contribution to determining appropriate mitigation, in particular, biodiversity offsetting. For that purpose, we analysed the dispersal of large mammals in a region potentially influenced by a mine located in the Atlantic rainforest in Brazil and anticipate the long-term outcomes of restoration offsets by modelling a 30-year post-offset scenario. Results show that: (i) offsets enhance ecological connectivity and are used as an alternative habitat for the animals dispersed due to habitat loss and fragmentation; (ii) the location of restoration areas should be carefully planned to maximize their contribution to increase ecological connectivity and enhance habitat quality. The reviewed case suggests that best practices to incorporate connectivity analysis in environmental impact assessment include: (i) monitoring biodiversity to quantify losses and gains; (ii) modelling offset areas alternatives for both protection and restoration; and (iii) conducting rigorous analysis of project alternatives, aiming at impact avoidance.

TI  - Seed characterization and direct sowing of native grass species as a management tool
T2  - GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is insufficient information about germination, seed biology and seedling establishment of native grass species of the cerrado (Brazilian savannah) to recommend their use in restoration of disturbed areas. We evaluated the production, percentage of fertile seeds, germination, seedling growth and establishment in the field of eighteen native grass species and one exotic invasive species (Melinis minutiflora) and also the effects of different storage periods on germination. The percentage of fertile seeds varied from 6.0 to 94.2% among native species. Ten species produced a minimum of 800 fertile seeds per gram. Germination rate was in the range of 11.0 to 98.8%. Storage for 1 year reduced the germination rate in one species, did not affect germination of three species and increased germination (by 2-10 times) in 14 species. After 2 years of storage, six species showed reductions in germination. Three different patterns of resource allocation were observed and might provide mechanisms for increasing seedling establishment under different environmental conditions. In the field, only two species flowered in the first year after sowing and an additional eight in the second year of observation. Melinis minutiflora is an aggressive species with more than three times the fertile seed production of native species (2820 seeds per gram), high germination rate (55%) and a high number of germinable seeds (1551 per gram). Despite the wide variation in seed characteristics and the delay in flowering, it is concluded that most native grass species can be used in projects aiming at the restoration and management of degraded areas.

TI  - Land use as a filter for species composition in Amazonian secondary forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions: Secondary succession in the tropics can follow alternative pathways. Land-use history is known to engender alternative successional communities, but the underlying mechanisms driving and sustaining divergence remain unclear. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in determining species composition?Location: Central Amazon, Brazil.Methods: We sampled trees, shrubs and palms (>= 1cm diameter) in 38 early secondary forests (5 yr after abandonment) located along gradients of land-use intensity in five shifting cultivation landscapes. We measured the diameter and height of each sampled plant, identified it to species or morpho-species level and checked if it was resprouting or not. At each secondary forest we also collected soil samples for chemical and physical analyses and estimated the amount of old-growth forest surrounding it (landscape composition).Results: We found that previous land-use intensity determined species composition. With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of cut-and-burn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that can cope with low nutrient availability. Landscape composition had a weak effect on species assemblages. We found specific species assemblages and indicator species associated with different levels of previous land-use intensity. As a consequence of these local filters, species alpha- and beta-diversity decreased and therefore early successional communities became more similar to each other.Conclusion: Species composition of successional forests is strongly determined by different land-use intensities. Dispersal limitation has a limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species. Filtering effects of management practices and soil quality determine the species dominating the canopy at early stages of succession and narrow down the range of species able to colonize and establish. This study highlights how land use shapes successional communities and suggests that alternative successional pathways are determined at early stages of succession. Therefore, accounting for land-use history is crucial to improve the understanding of tropical secondary succession. We present a list of indicator species for different levels of previous land-use intensity that can be used to support conservation and restoration decisions in the Amazon.

TI  - "Cerrado'' restoration by direct seeding: field establishment and initial growth of 75 trees, shrubs and grass species
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coexistence of grasses, herbs, shrubs and trees characterizes savannas; therefore, to restore such ecosystems one should consider re-introducing all these growth forms. Currently, little is known about field establishment of most "Cerrado'' (Brazilian savanna) species that could be used for restoration purposes. Most knowledge on restoration is focused on planting seedlings of tree species from forest physiognomies. Alternatively, direct seeding can be an appropriate method to re-introduce plants of different life forms to restore savannas. We evaluated the initial establishment success under field conditions of 75 "Cerrado'' native species (50 trees, 13 shrubs, and 12 grasses) in direct seeding experiments in four sites in Central Brazil for 2.5 years. For that, we tagged and measured tree and larger shrub species and estimated ground cover by small shrub and grass species. Sixty-two species became established (42 trees, 11 shrubs and 9 grasses) under field conditions. Thirty-eight of the 48 tagged species had relatively high emergence rates ([10%) and 41 had high seedling survival ([60%) in the first year. Among grasses and small shrub species, Andropogon fastigiatus Sw., Aristida riparia Trin., Schizachyrium sanguineum (Retz.) Alston, Lepidaploa aurea (Mart. ex DC.) H.Rob., Stylosanthes capitata Vogel, S. macrocephala M.B. Ferreira & Sousa Costa, Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC. and Trachypogon spicatus (L.f.) Kuntze had the greatest initial establishment success (up to 30% soil cover). The data on harvesting period, processing mode and field establishment for these 75 species can be readily used in restoration efforts in the "Cerrado''.

TI  - Multifunctional soil recovery during the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest after bauxite mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Ecosystem restoration is a global priority, currently promoted by several ambitious commitments. Most of the research to guide restoration practices was so far put on the recovery of above-ground functions and services, although soil health is increasingly recognized as a fundamental condition to restoration success. Soil restoration is particularly needed in mining areas, in which the surface soil layers are removed and the left over, highly deprived substrate does not support vegetation recovery.2. Here, we evaluated the potential of active restoration to recover soil attributes after bauxite mining in the Brazil's Atlantic Forest. We specifically studied how physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes down to 40 cm depth respond to restoration (i.e. topsoil spreading and tree planting) by comparing newly mined areas, areas undergoing restoration for similar to 7 years and conserved forests. We further explored the associations between microbiological and physico-chemical soil attributes.3. Restoration interventions resulted in a 10-fold increase in the soil organic matter content compared to mined areas, as well as in the recovery of P content. Restoration was also shown to be associated with the recovery of the activity and diversity of soil bacterial communities, reaching similar levels to those observed in conserved forest. Restored and conserved forests were characterized by a higher proportion of Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. All bacterial attributes were correlated with soil physical attributes, except for microporosity, and with organic matter and cation exchange capacity.4. Within a few years, restoration allowed recovering crucial physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes, reaching levels comparable to those found in conserved forests.5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that intensive management can result in the fast restoration of tropical forest soils after mining, at least at small scales. Our results stress the need to consider soil recovery both as a driver and a measure of ecosystem restoration success, and support the development of more holistic monitoring protocols to be used during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Mitigation through Sustainable Intensification of Livestock Production in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - EUROCHOICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are projected to reach 3.2 gigatonnes (CO2 eq.) by 2020. The government has made a voluntary commitment to reduce this figure by 40 per cent. A reduction in deforestation and livestock mitigation measures are key components of this commitment. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian Savannah), we analyse abatement potential and cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation measures applicable to livestock production. We focus on the role of intensification measures, particularly pasture restoration and animal performance to meet the objectives of increasing beef production to meet higher demand, while simultaneously reducing emissions. We use a linear programming model that optimises pasture intensification levels according to biophysical and economic parameters and growth in beef demand. We estimate changes in soil carbon stocks generated by pasture management and land use change. According to a baseline projection, beef production in the Cerrado accounts for an average of approximately 122 million tonnes of CO2 eq. per year from 2010 to 2030. The results of our analysis suggest that by implementing cost-effective measures, projected emissions in the region could be reduced by around 24 per cent. Pasture restoration, which will reduce deforestation, is the largest contributor to these results.

TI  - Water Quality and Vegetation Health in Urban Conservation Areas: A Case Study of Paragem Municipal Natural Park
T2  - Ecotoxicology and Environmental Contamination
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paragem Municipal Natural Park (PMNP), an integral protection conservation unit, plays a crucial role in the conservation and recovery of ecosystems located in the city of Dourados/MS. Located in an urban area, it faces challenges related to human influence, which can affect its terrestrial and aquatic communities. This study aimed to analyze the vegetation index and diagnose the water quality of a tributary of the Paragem stream located within the PMNP. The research involved examining the Green Leaf Index, physical-chemical and microbiological parameters of the water, as well as ecotoxicological tests covering three trophic levels. In addition, the genotoxic effect of the water on a piscean model was investigated. The results revealed low vegetation cover and degradation of the park's water quality, evidenced by microbial contamination, toxicity to primary producers, and genetic damage to fish. Therefore, these results indicate the need for monitoring and environmental education measures, ecological restoration, and water resource recovery and conservation management in the PMNP to favor the recovery and conservation of its environmental resources.

TI  - Measuring the causal effect of no-till system adoption on Brazilian natural areas
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till system (NTS) is a method of soil management that involves techniques recommended to increase agricultural land productivity. Therefore, employing NTS results in changes in agricultural land use decisions and indirectly impacts the conservation of natural areas. This study aims to evaluate the causal effect between NTS adoption and land use decisions in Brazil, with particular attention to their impacts on natural areas. The discussion on the effects of NTS use over agricultural practices gains relevance in Brazil, given the country's strategic position in the global agricultural market and the need to preserve tropical natural areas to mitigate global warming and preserve local biodiversity. We conducted this assessment using the statistical approach of spatial propensity score matching, which relies on a small set of assumptions to estimate causal effects in experiments with observational data robustly. Our statistical results show that the adoption of NTS had a positive effect on the natural (0.338; p-value < 0.05) and cultivated agricultural (0.214; p-value < 0.05) areas of the treated municipalities. The evidence from this case study indicates that NTS allows for the recovery of eroded soil and expansion of cultivated lands, preserving natural areas, while corroborating Borlaug's approach and further reinforcing the use of NTS as a sustainable soil management practice.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for achieving Sustainable Development Goals through restoration of Indonesia's mangroves
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia, the most mangrove-rich nation in the world, has proposed the most globally ambitious mangrove rehabilitation target (600,000 ha) of any nation, to be achieved by 2024 to support multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 1-3, 6, 13 and 14). Yet, mangrove restoration and rehabilitation across the world have often suffered low success rates and been applied at small scales. Here, we identify 193,367 ha (estimated costs at US$0.29-1.74 billion) that have the potential to align with the national mangrove rehabilitation programme. Despite being only 30% of the national target, our robust assessment considered biogeomorphology, 20 years of land-use and land-cover change and state forest land status, all key factors moderating mangrove restoration success which have often been neglected in Indonesia. Increasing subnational government representation in mangrove governance as well as improving monitoring and evaluation will increase the likelihood of achieving the mangrove rehabilitation targets and reduce risks of failure. Rehabilitating and conserving mangroves in Indonesia could benefit 74 million coastal people and can potentially contribute to the national land-sector emissions reduction of up to 16%.

TI  - Habitat suitability for primate conservation in north-east Brazil
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has a high diversity of primates, but increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change could influence forest cover in the country and cause future changes in the distribution of primate populations. Here we aim to assess the long-term suitability of habitats for the conservation of three threatened Brazilian primates (Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus flavius and Sapajus libidinosus) through (1) estimating their current and future distributions using species distribution models, (2) evaluating how much of the areas projected to be suitable is represented within protected areas and priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and (3) assessing the extent of remaining forest cover in areas predicted to be suitable for these species. We found that 88% of the suitable areas are outside protected areas and only 24% are located in areas with forest cover. Although not within protected areas, 27% of the climatically suitable areas are considered priority areas for conservation. Future projections, considering a severe climate change scenario, indicate that A. belzebul, S. flavius and S. libidinosus may lose up to 94, 98 and 54% of their suitable range, respectively. The establishment of primate populations and their long-term survival in these areas are at risk. Mitigation actions such as the implementation of new protected areas, forest restoration and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be essential for the conservation of Brazilian primates.

TI  - Period of collection and indolebutyric acid in the rooting of minicuttings of Surinam cherry
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The minicutting is a promising vegetative propagation technique. This study makes a contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the propagation of Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora L.) (Myrtaceae), native tree of Brazil, with potential for ecological restoration, exploitation by food, cosmetic and medical industries, and can improve the life in rural communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of the minicutting technique in the vegetative propagation of Surinam cherry, through productivity and survival of ministumps, and rooting of minicuttings treated with different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) in the successive collections. Ministumps were obtained from seedlings produced by Surinam cherry seeds, which were grown in root plugs, and their tips were trimmed so as to stimulate shoot growth. From these ministumps eight successive collections of shoots (minicuttings) were made. A completely randomized experimental design was used in an 8 x 4 factorial arrangement (eight collection times of minicuttings and four concentrations of IBA), with four replications and 20 minicuttings as an experimental unit. The survival rate of the ministumps was 99.28% with mean yield of 362 minicuttings per m(2) per month was obtained, considering 2.5 minicuttings per ministump per collection every 51 days. The greatest mean production of minicuttings occurred in the collection 4 (summer) and the least in the collection 8 (winter). Adventitious rooting was observed ranging from 57.2 (collection 6) to 97.2% (collection 1). The minicuttings derived from the first five collections made up to 247 days after installation of minigarden exhibit significantly greater rooting indices than those derived from the last three collections, in addition to the better quality of the root system. The rooting of minicuttings from seminal origin of Surinam cherry is enhanced with the use of IBA at concentrations of around 2,500 mg L-1.

TI  - An economic valuation of mangrove restoration in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are under considerable pressure in many developing countries and Brazil is not an exception to this problem. We investigate preferences for the restoration of mangrove areas in Brazil, using a choice experiment that varies the level and time of restoration. By interacting those attributes, we are able to identify nine potential scenarios that are expected to provide insight for policies and programs aimed to restore the threatened mangrove forest in the area. Conditional logit and scale heterogeneity multinomial logit models are estimated to analyze the respondents' choices. Our findings indicate that, out of the nine scenarios, respondents prefer a moderate restoration (i.e. vegetation health improvement of existing mangrove forest area) in less than 10 years. There also is a strong preference for complete restoration in 11 to 20 years, with complete restoration entailing vegetation health improvements and extension of the mangrove forest area of 20%. Results suggest that respondents understand that there are tradeoffs between levels and time of restoration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring the social science of tropical peatland restoration: Towards more effective community empowerment initiatives for the Aceh peatland ecosystem
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peat swamp forest in Aceh Province is one of the Indonesian peatland ecosystems that is undergoing systemic degradation due to land conversion. Strong corporate domination of land conversion activities has also degraded livelihood opportunities for local communities, driving them into poverty and conditions of underdevelopment. Despite government interventions aiming to improve both ecosystem and social sustainability that have included initiatives in community empowerment, the peatland has continued to suffer degradation. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of social aspects of the interventions. Our study analysed correlations amongst indicators of community empowerment on the one hand, and environmental, economic and social sustainability on the other, with a view to devising an improved approach for future sustainable development initiatives. Quantitative interview methods were used to survey 112 local residents, then qualitative and Structural Equation Model (SEM) analyses based on Likert scoring were employed to interpret the data. The results show that the social factor is the main reason for low empowerment of the community. In order to build capacity for independent and sustainable utilisation of the peatland, a new social-based learning approach to community empowerment is proposed.

TI  - Techniques for seedling production of two native grasses: new perspectives for Brazilian Cerrado restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a major need for restoration of nonforest ecosystems in the Brazilian Cerrado, and planting seedlings is promising. However, there is no currently available information on nontree species production in nurseries. Grasses are dominant in the Cerrado herbaceous layer; therefore, we tested whether tree seedling production techniques can be used for two native grasses widely spread across the Cerrado ecoregion (Schizachyrium sanguineum and Loudetiopsis chrysothrix). We performed a factorial experiment with three levels: (1) seedbed substrate, (2) container volume, and (3) final substrate. Seeds were germinated in seedbeds with native soil or sand and, after emergence, transferred to 30, 55, or 290 cm(3) containers filled with native soil, commercial substrate, or a mixture thereof. We evaluated seedling survival, height relative growth rate (RGR), tillering, and dry biomass. Survival rates after transfer from seedbeds to containers were greater than 80% for both species. Generally, species had greater height RGR, tillering, and biomass in the 290 cm(3) containers than in the other containers, and the presence of native soil in the seedbeds, as well as in the containers, fostered seedling growth. However, the use of native soil is not recommended for large-scale production, because its acquisition could degrade Cerrado areas. The commercial substrate improvement could be an alternative to increase seedling growth, since grasses survived well and presented greater growth in the largest container. Our study demonstrated that the techniques currently used in commercial nurseries for growing trees are suitable for both grasses, and substrates and container size drive seedling growth.

AB  - An important strategy for utilization of nutrients by plants is the internal redistribution of nutrients (movement of nutrients from older tissues toward younger tissues). Among native species in the Atlantic Forest, little is known about this mechanism. Studies to evaluate the redistribution of nutrients of these species can be an important tool in the selection of potential species for restoration of degraded areas. Thus, the objective of this work was to analyze the content and redistribution of nutrients in the leaves from two species of high litter production and growth, for restoration of degraded areas in the north of Espirito Santo State: Bixa arborea Huber. and Joannesia princeps Vell. The study was conducted in three plantings of native species with different diversities (D1 = 29 species; D2 = 58 species; D3 = 114 species). In each panting five individuals of these species (Bixa arborea e J. princeps) were randomly selected, and under their canopies rectangular collectors were installed. After a month, the leaves intercepted by the collectors (senescent leaves) were collected, and simultaneously leaves in the canopy were collected (mature leaves). The collections of material occurred in October 2013 (the lowest rainfall season) and January 2014 (highest rainfall). After oven drying, the samples were triturated and subjected to chemical analysis to determine the levels of nutrients, and subsequently redistributions were calculated. In order to analyze the nutrient content of plant tissues we used the randomized design in a factorial design (3 treatments per two physiological stages of leaves) with five replications. The large number of different treatments did not influence the levels of most nutrients from leaf tissue of both species in both seasons. The nutrients N, P and K were redistributed over the two species. The redistribution of nutrients in J. princeps tended to be higher in periods of low rainfall, and Bixa arborea tended to be higher in the period of greatest rainfall. Both species have an efficient pattern of reuse of nutrients, showing great potential for forest restoration.

TI  - Interspecific variation in vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in pioneer and non-pioneer species used in tropical forest restoration
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation projects have gained interest over recent years due to the loss of biodiversity in tropical regions as a result of large deforestation by anthropogenic actions. However, better knowledge on the tolerance of plant species to environmental stresses is needed for reforestation success. Here, we evaluated the photoprotective and antioxidant capacity, in terms of vitamin E accumulation, of five pioneer (Platypodium elegans Vogel, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil, Cecropia pachystachya Tr,cul. and Aegiphila sellowiana Cham.) and five non-pioneer (Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemo, Cedrela fissilis Vell., Genipa americana L., Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. and Hymenaea courbaril L.) species, in relation to the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. Furthermore, we examined differences between sun and shade leaves on vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation. Pioneer plants showed on average 33% higher malondialdehyde levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, than non-pioneer species, but no significant differences in vitamin E contents. In contrast, a marked interspecific variation was observed in the levels of alpha-tocopherol and its precursor, gamma-tocopherol. Natural variation revealed interesting relationships between vitamin E levels and the extent of lipid peroxidation in leaves. The pioneer species, P. elegans, did not accumulate alpha-tocopherol and displayed the highest levels of malondialdehyde. Sun and shade leaves accumulated vitamin E levels to a similar extent, except for the pioneer L. pacari and the non-pioneer C. langsdorffii, the former accumulating more alpha-tocopherol in sun leaves and the latter in shade leaves. We conclude that interspecific variation is higher than both leaf type and successional-group variation in terms of vitamin E accumulation and the extent of lipid peroxidation, and that vitamin E levels, particularly those of alpha-tocopherol, negatively correlate with the extent of lipid peroxidation, thus supporting a photoprotective and antioxidant function for vitamin E in plants growing in tropical environments.

TI  - SOIL SEED BANK AND ACCUMULATED LITTER IN RESTORED FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the soil seed bank and accumulated litter in a restored forest through planting, aged 40, in Vicosa, MG. We allocated 16 contiguous plots of 25 x 25 m, covering the entire forest area (1 ha). In each plot, we collected five samples of surface soil (0.30 x 0.30 x 0.05 m) to evaluate the seed bank by germination method and a sample of 1.0 m(2) litter for evaluation of accumulated litter. We performed the classification of individuals and species of seedlings of the seed bank as for successional category, dispersion syndrome and life form. 5,555 seedlings were recorded, belonging to 32 families and 93 species and morphotype which grouped all the vines. We recorded the predominance of zoochoric dispersion syndrome and, as for life form, a higher percentage of herbs, at the species level (48.6%) and individuals (44.8%). Among the shrub-arboreal species, we observed a higher percentage of successional category pioneer, species level (75.1%) and individuals (85.1%). The accumulated litter average was of 3,432 kg ha(-1), with the leaf fraction representing 65% and significant correlation with basal area (p = 0.031, R-2 = 0.29) of the tree stratum. The results indicate that the soil seed bank of forest restored after 40 years of its implementation is similar, as for ecological relations, to the areas of stational semidecidual forest in the same region and other restored areas that were also used for planting seedlings.

TI  - Millennial-scale variability of water supply, vegetation and fire activity on a tropical wetland in central Brazil
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pandeiros wetland is a tropical wetland located in the ecotone between the Cerrado and the Caatinga, in central Brazil. It has a key ecological importance for vegetation biodiversity, hydrological cycles, fauna repro-duction and feeding, and for local human populations. Here, we investigate millennial-scale variability of water supply, vegetation structure and fire activity in the Pandeiros wetland during the Late Holocene and discuss forcing mechanisms that affected flooding, vegetation cover and fire regime within this fragile ecosystem. Our study is based on the previously studied pollen record of the Pandeiros palm swamp and on new charcoal an-alyses of two sediment cores that cover the last 4500 cal years, and their comparison to modern pollen and to available paleoclimatic data. Our results show that both local rainfall at the Pandeiros River basin and southern rainfall at the upper Sa & SIM;o Francisco River were important in maintaining water supply for the Pandeiros wetland during the last millennia. Our data also suggest that during Late Holocene the arboreal cover declined in the Cerrado of the Pandeiros Basin, an opposite trend to that observed in the wetter Cerrado-Atlantic Forest ecotone. We propose that increasing summer insolation in Southern Hemisphere was an important factor in maintaining low arboreal cover and open savanna vegetation on the drier areas around the Pandeiros wetland. Regarding fire activity, we suggest that until around 2600 cal yr BP, climate conditions were the most important driver of fire activity, in which drier conditions favored the intensification of fire, whereas subsequently, anthropic activities appear to have become an important fire inducer. Our findings highlight the multiple environmental aspects that have influenced the Pandeiros wetland history during the last four thousand years, including monsoon vari-ability, insolation variation and human occupation.

TI  - Seed bank and optimization in the recovery of degraded areas of Caatinga
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil seed bank is used as a tool for recomposition of degraded areas, through the improvement and establishment of species, succession and increased biological diversity. Thus, the work evaluated the seed bank of two areas of the Parque estadual Mata da Pimenteira - PEMP and the effect of environmental conditions on seed germination, and their potential for implantation in degraded areas. Soil and litter were collected in two areas (Serra Branca and Pimenteira), which were homogenized, trays and subjected to 70% shading or sun. Seedlings were accounted for and identified. In addition, it determined the density, porosity and speed of basic infiltration (VIB) in the soil in both areas. The emergency relationship, depending on the seed bank and packaging, was evaluated by descriptive and graphical response surface statistics. The relationship between emergence and soil characteristics was observed through correlation. Pimenteira's seed bank showed the highest rate of emergence and diversity. In addition, shading enhances material regeneration. In this context, the insertion of these nuclei-shaped sections in the restoration sectors of the park itself is a potential strategy.

TI  - INITIAL GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF VALUABLE TIMBER SPECIES IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL: Araucaria angustifolia, Balfourodendron riedelianum, AND Parapiptadenia rigida
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The initial growth of three Brazilian native timber species in the city of Dois Vizinhos-PR, Brazil, was described - Araucaria angustifolia, Balfourodendron riedelianum, and Parapiptadenia rigida, using four non-linear mathematical models (Gompertz, Logistic, Logistic 4P, and Chapman-Richards). In the first 4 years after planting, information about collar diameter (mm), total height (m), crown height (m), and crown diameter (m) was obtained twice a year for 12 individuals per species. Crown area (m(2)) and crown volume (m(3)) were estimated. The growth in these four variables (collar diameter, total height, crown area, and crown volume) was projected using the models, and their fitting was assessed based on the values of the Akaike Information Criterion, the Bayesian Information Criterion, the standard error of estimate, and the coefficient of determination. The models generated excellent statistics for all parameters in all variables, with better statistics for collar diameter (coefficient of determination higher than 0.65 and standard error lower than 30%) and total height (coefficients of determination higher than 0.72 and standard error lower than 37%). Considering the three species, Parapiptadenia rigida showed the fastest growth in all variables (median of 70.97 mm for collar diameter, median of 4.475 m for total height, median of 10.35 m(2) for crown area, and median of 15.30 m(3) for crown volume at 48 months). Longer monitoring periods in this and other experiments are recommended to characterize the growth of these three Brazilian native timber species to adequately describe their performance in timber and forest restoration projects.

TI  - Eutrophic soils and weathering levels influence the distribution of seasonally dry forests in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonally Dry Forests, or 'Dry Forests,' are characterized by deciduous vegetation that sheds leaf during the dry season due to strong soil moisture stress. Despite their ecological significance, as part of the Atlantic Forest realm, research on the diversity, genesis, and soil-vegetation interactions in these ecosystems remains limited. This study investigated the soil attributes of Dry Forests of an ecotonal zone, comparing with the neighboring biomes, the Caatinga (Steppe Savanna) and Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna). We analyzed 16 soil profiles, evaluating their physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Dry Forest soils (DFS) showed higher amounts of exchangeable cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ (Sum of Bases: 2.84-14.79 cmolc dm- 3 in the surface horizons) and no detectable Al3+. The clay fraction of DFS is mainly illite and kaolinite. The PCA results (PC1: 29.4 %) revealed that Dry Forest soils, particularly on limestone, are more fertile than adjacent Caatinga and Cerrado soils. In contrast, according to the interpretation of PC2 (19.5 %) Cerrado soils are much more weathered and nutrient-depleted (Sum of Bases: 0.37-1.29 cmolc dm-3 in the surface horizons), while Caatinga soils exhibit an intermediate fertility (Sum of Bases: 1.48-21.81 cmolc dm- 3 in the surface horizons), and less weathered. The lithologies under DFS at northern Minas Gerais are limestones of the Bambui Group, resistant sedimentary rocks of the Maca & uacute;bas Group, and Granite/gneisses of the Crystalline Basement, which strongly influence soil fertility, mineralogy, and weathering degree. The higher nutrient levels and organic matter contents (2.05-12.03 % in the surface horizons) in DFS support greater productivity and biomass accumulation. These findings highlight the ecological significance of DFS on diverse geological substrates, offering insights for conservation, sustainable management, and ecological restoration in the face of increasing deforestation and land degradation threats.

TI  - From desertification to restoration in the Brazilian semiarid region: Unveiling the potential of land restoration on soil microbial properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land desertification poses a significant challenge in the Brazilian semiarid region, encompassing a substantial portion of the country. Within this region, the detrimental effects of human activities, particularly unsuitable anthropic actions, have resulted in diminished vegetation cover and an accelerated rate of soil erosion. Notably, practices such as overgrazing and the conversion of native forests into pasturelands have played a pivotal role in exacerbating the process of land desertification. Ultimately, land desertification results in significant losses of soil organic matter and microbial diversity. To address this pressing issue and contribute to the existing literature, various land restoration practices, such as grazing exclusion, cover crops, and terracing, have been implemented in the Brazilian semiarid. These practices have shown promising results in terms of enhancing soil fertility and restoring microbial properties. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in improving soil microbial properties in the Brazilian semiarid region remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent advances in molecular techniques have improved our understanding of microbial communities in lands undergoing desertification and restoration. In this review, we focus on assessing the effectiveness of these restoration practices in revitalizing soil microbial properties, with a particular emphasis on the soil microbiome and its functions. Through a critical assessment of the impact of these practices on soil microbial properties, our research aims to provide valuable insights that can help mitigate the adverse effects of desertification and promote sustainable development in this ecologically sensitive region.

TI  - The Conservation Value of Degraded Forests for Agile Gibbons Hylobates agilis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - All gibbon species are globally threatened with extinction yet conservation efforts are undermined by a lack of population and ecological data. Agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) occur in Sumatra, Indonesia and adjacent mainland Southeast Asia. Population densities are known from four sites (three in Sumatra) while little is known about their ability to tolerate habitat degradation. We conducted a survey of agile gibbons in Harapan Rainforest, a lowland forest site in Sumatra. The area has been severely degraded by selective logging and encroachment but is now managed for ecosystem restoration. We used two survey methods: an established point count method for gibbons with some modifications, and straight line transects using auditory detections. Surveys were conducted in the three main forest types prevalent at the site: high, medium, and low canopy cover secondary forests. Mean group density estimates were higher from point counts than from line transects, and tended to be higher in less degraded forests within the study site. We consider points more time efficient and reliable than transects since detectability of gibbons was higher from points per unit effort. We recommend the additional use of Distance sampling methods to account for imperfect detection and provide other recommendations to improve surveys of gibbons. We estimate that the site holds at least 6,070 and as many as 11,360 gibbons. Our results demonstrate that degraded forests can be extremely important for the conservation of agile gibbons and that efforts to protect and restore such sites could contribute significantly to the conservation of the species.

TI  - Organic Mulching Alters the Soil Microclimate, Increases Survival and Growth of Tree Seedlings in Restoration Planting
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic mulching has been suggested as an option for managing spontaneous species in restoration plantings and can promote improvements in soil properties and performance of planted species. The aim of this study was to test the effect of crowning techniques on soil microclimatic and performance of forest seedlings. The experiment was carried out in Goi & aacute;s state, Brazil. Two study factors were used: crowning techniques (manual weeding, cardboard, wood chipping and control-without weed competition management), and six tree species: Anadenanthera peregrina, Ceiba speciosa, Dipteryx alata, Inga edulis, Genipa americana and Spondias mombin. Soil temperature and moisture assessments were performed within the crowning area (0.25 m2). Seedling survival and growth in height and diameter were evaluated over 219 days. Organic mulching treatments of wood chipping and cardboard provided increase in soil moisture and decrease in temperature, resulting in higher seedling survival rate. The increase in height and diameter differed among species under study, with A. peregrina standing out in height and C. speciosa in diameter. The crowning techniques did not influence the average height of species; however, wood chipping provided greater diameter increase. The findings of this study indicate that mulching treatments, by contributing to increase soil moisture and decrease soil temperature, can be used as crowning techniques to increase the survival rate and diameter growth of tree species in restoration plantings.

TI  - BIOSOLIDS AS SUBSTRATE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CEIBA SPECIOSA SEEDLINGS
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biosolids is a problematic residual issue in Brazil and other developing countries, where it is common to discard this material in landfills and/or open dumps. However, biosolids can be recycled in agricultural and forestry activities, considering they have high contents of organic matter and nutrients. Therefore, their application in substrates to produce forest seedlings can be benefi cial. The scope of this study is to evaluate substrates with different proportions of biosolids and coconut fiber in the growth and quality of seedlings of Ceiba speciosa (A. St.-Hil.) Ravenna, a native species from South America that is largely used for landscaping and forest restoration. There were studied substrates with proportions varying between 25 to 100% of biosolids and 75 to 0% of coconut fiber to produce seedlings in containers (plastic tubes with 280 cm(3)). At 120 days after sowing, it was measured the growth, biomass and quality of the seedlings. In general aspects, the higher the proportion of biosolids in the substrate, the higher were the growth, biomass and quality. The biosolids favored the growth in shoot height and biomass more than in diameter and root biomass. Considering the positive results and the possibility of recycling biosolids, it is recommended the use of substrates containing from 50 to 100% of biosolids to produce Ceiba speciosa seedlings in 280 cm(3) plastic tubes.

TI  - Potential seed dispersal by Didelphis albiventris (Marsupialia, Didelphidae) in highly disturbed environment
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests are usually isolated and highly disturbed, however they are important shelters for tolerant animal species. Their food habits expose the different ecological roles these animals perform in the habitat. We analyzed the contribution of Didelphis albiventris Lund (1840), as a seed disperser, to the vegetation renewal of an urban forest fragment, describing its frugivorous diet and testing the viability of ingested seeds. Both male and female of white-eared opossum included a vast variety of items in their diet, mainly invertebrates and fruits. Fruits were consumed during all year round and seasonality was not observed. The majority of consumed fruits was from pioneer plant species, which is common in disturbed areas, in accordance to the opossum's opportunistic habits. The viability of ingested seeds, evaluated by linear logistic regression models applied to data from germination tests, was different of the seeds collected directly from ripe fruits; it varied among species, maybe due to the intrinsic characteristics of plant species. As a highly generalist species, D. albiventris can inhabit disturbed environments and then disperse seeds from pioneer plants, where the vegetation must be restored. It is crucial that this process does not depend only on the specialist frugivores, which are frequently absent in urban forest fragments. Therefore, the presence of generalist species of secondary environments has its importance emphasized.

TI  - Harnessing Biomass and Blue Carbon Potential: Estimating Carbon Stocks in the Vital Wetlands of Eastern Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is a critical factor driving climate change, impacting every aspect of life on Earth. The escalating concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the primary contributor to global warming, necessitates immediate action through effective climate mitigation strategies. This study aimed to quantify the biomass and blue carbon stocks in the eastern coastal mangrove forests of North Sumatra and Aceh Provinces in Indonesia, focusing on key sites in Langkat, Deli Serdang, Batu Bara, Tanjung Balai, and Aceh Tamiang Regencies. We measured carbon stock in three carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), necromass, and soil. By analyzing tree stands using parameters such as tree height and diameter at breast height within circular plots (7 m in radius, 125 m apart), we gathered fundamental data on forest structure, species composition, and above- and below-ground biomass. Additionally, we collected soil samples at various points and depths, measuring the amount of wood, stems, or branches (necromass) that fell to or died on the forest floor. Data were collected in plots along a line transect, comprising three transects and six circular plots each. Sixteen diverse mangrove species were found, demonstrating rich mangrove biodiversity. The mangrove forests in the five regencies exhibited significant carbon storage potential, with estimated average above-ground carbon ranging from 96 to 356 MgC/ha and average below-ground carbon from 28 to 153 MgC/ha. The estimated average deadwood carbon varied between 50 and 91 MgC/ha, while soil carbon ranged from 1200 to 2500 MgC/ha. These findings underscore the significant carbon storage potential of these mangrove forests, highlighting their importance to global carbon cycling and climate change mitigation. This research contributes to a broader understanding of mangroves as vital blue carbon ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of conservation efforts such as forest restoration and rehabilitation to enhance their role in stabilizing coastal areas and improving global climate resilience.

TI  - Higher fire frequency impaired woody species regeneration in a south-eastern Amazonian forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understorey wildfires harm tropical forests by affecting natural regeneration, but the trajectories of fire-disturbed forests after disturbance are poorly understood. To fill this gap, we conducted experimental burns in a transitional forest between the Amazon forests and the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) and investigated their effects on plant community diversity of regeneration. The experiment consisted of three 50-ha plots that between 2004 and 2010 were burned either annually (six times), every three years (thrice) or not at all (Control). To evaluate early post-fire recovery, we recorded grass occurrence and regenerating stems (<= 1 cm in diameter at breast height). We noted that high fire-frequency plots had a reduction of species richness (62%) and abundance (84%) and were associated with floristic and structural changes, dominance of few species and increase of grass colonization when compared with low fire-frequency. We observed that resprouts were the main pathway for forest restoration in both burned regimes, particularly in low fire-frequency. However, the forest can recover from fires by means of resprouting, until a threshold in fire frequency is reached, when resprouts and seedlings declined for most of the species, with a few fire-tolerant species becoming dominant.

TI  - Evaluating tree survival and modeling initial growth for Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has become an important complementary practice to protect natural resources and preserve biodiversity. However, native species may be used in restoration programs in ways that do not optimize their performance. This research evaluated the survival and to model the initial growth of 15 native tree species planted in "filling" and "diversity" lines in the post-planting phase of a restoration experiment in the subtropics of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We measured survival rate (%) one year after planting and collar diameter (mm), total height (m), crown projection area (m(2)) and crown volume (m(3)) in the first 48 months after planting. Growth modeling for each variable and species was based on the non-linear mathematical Logistic, Gompertz, and Chapman-Richards models. Model selection for each variable/species was supported by the Akaike Information Criterion, standard error of the estimate, and coefficient of determination. The highest survival rates were reported for Cordia americana, Gochnatia polymorpha, Inga uruguensis, Peltophorum dubium, Prunus sellowii e Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (91.7%) and for Solanum mauritianum (90.3%). The species with faster growth were, by increasing order, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum and Croton urucurana. With a better understanding of the initial developmental potential of tree species, it is possible to increase the species and functional diversity of the filling group. There was no single model capable of describing the variables analyzed and different models were needed to describe different characteristics and species.

TI  - Biophysical and Socioeconomic Factors Associated to Deforestation and Forest Recovery in Brazilian Tropical Dry Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of land cover changes (LCCs) and their association to biophysical and socioeconomic factors is vital to support government policies toward the sustainable use of natural resources. The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piaui). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km(2) (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact.

TI  - Landcover classification of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands using ALOS/PALSAR, RADARSAT-2 and ENVISAT/ASAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal is part of a large continuous tropical wetland that exhibits a high biodiversity of flora and fauna species, and many threatened habitats. The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil-landscape-vegetation relationships in grassland-forest boundaries, and possible applications in ecological restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Edaphic influence on plant distribution is essential to community ecology studies, and for vegetation management and restoration in grasslands-forest ecosystems. Pampa biome is a subtropical grassland with high floristic diversity and with an important role in food production in South America, including tree plantations where recent changes in land use soil has been questioned about the impacts on water consumption, soil degradation and potential biodiversity loss. We assessed the relationship of soil physical, chemical and morphological properties with forest and grassland species occurrence, to improve our understanding of soil and landscapes with grasslands-forest mosaics, and contribute to ecological restoration in the biome. Soil physical and chemical properties were determined in different toposequences localized in two forest farms in southern Brazil, both covered with grassland and native forest use. Natural fertility of the studied soils was highest in the lowlands, along with highest moisture and lowest toxic aluminum content. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was highest in the summit and backslope soils, influenced by coarser fractions in the granulometry. Soil bulk density, total porosity, microporosity, macroporosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity field capacity, permanent wilting point and available water content, influenced by sand, silt and clay contents, varied among soils and landscape and contributed to vegetation diversity. Some of the plant species occupied specific soils and landscapes. The greatest vegetation frequency was of grassland species (Poaceae and Asteraceae) in both study sites. Grasslandforest area has forest individuals in the middle of the grassland and riparian, while in grassland area the riparian vegetation is composed naturally by grassland. Forest fragments expanded in grassland-forest area during the 15 years prior to our study, but in the grassland area there were no changes in the phyto-physiognomy, demonstrating that the vegetation of grassland occurs naturally in the riparian environment. This study highlights that many of sites covered naturally by grassland, in the Pampa biome, should be protected from disruptive activities and/or recovered with species endemic to the ecosystem, without necessarily by forest enrichment as usually recommended for restoration activities.

TI  - Topography imposes an abiotic filter on tree growth in restored areas
T2  - THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography is a key abiotic factor for plant performance and, despite the well-known effects of topographic features on tree growth and traits in mature and secondary forests, less attention has been paid to early-stage restoration areas. We aimed to test whether and how elevation, slope, and slope aspects affect tree growth rates, and morpho-physiological traits in restoration. In this scenario, we asked which traits correlate with tree growth? How do species adjust their growth and traits to topography? And how does intraspecific variation change with topography? This study was carried out on a hill of ca. 70 m, with a former history of use for pasture. Six tree species were monitored over a one-year sampling interval. Principal component analysis, simple regressions, and ANOVA tests were applied. More growth was observed in the north-facing aspect. Traits related to photoprotection (non-photochemical quenching, and total carotenoids) were the ones that most correlated with growth rates, most notably stem diameter, which suggests that strategies for dealing with photoinhibition are crucial for tree growth in degraded pastures. Four out of six species showed a great differentiation between slope aspects. Physiological traits were more plastic and responsive to topography than was specific leaf area. While significant relationships between species and topographic features were an indication that intraspecific variation is influenced by topography, the direction of changes in intraspecific variation was not common to all species (except for total chlorophyll). The results indicate that species selection processes for restoration in degraded pastures should consider the interaction between functional traits (including pigments, and chlorophyll a fluorescence) and local topography.

T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and restoration projects involving abandoned cattle pastures pose several challenges. Restoration ecologists recognize that natural restoration is possible, but few species can successfully colonize degraded pastures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether land colonized by the tree Myracrodruon urundeuva increase the amount of habitat available for bird communities in Southeastern Brazil. We used fixed point counts within a 50m radius to compare the richness and composition of the bird community inhabiting naturally regenerated M urundeuva with that an adjacent native forest remnant and a forest restored with planted Acacia spp. We recorded a total of 68 bird species. The M urundeuva forest was able to provide valuable habitat for bird species, including more forest species, in comparison with the Acacia planting. These results indicate that M urundeuva is a useful species for the ecological restoration of degraded pasture land.

We present a compilation of historical and current data on the avifauna of the SESC Interlagos region, in the southeast of the respective municipality. A total of 152 species were registered between 1964 and 2020, of which 16 are endemic to the Atlantic Forest, 13 migratory and one threatened. Of this total, 21 were registered prior to the 1970s and 143 from 1995 onwards, with seven taxa that may be locally extinct due to deforestation. The organized data show the importance of scientific collections, projects undertaken by university students, online ornithological data platforms, forest restoration actions carried out in the unit, and educational activities promoted in recent decades by SESC Interlagos, including bird watching and environmental awareness programs. This sampling effort makes SESC Interlagos one of the best ornithologically-known regions in the municipality of Sao Paulo. However, the presence of exotic animal and plant species, feral domestic animals, and large amounts of waste on the banks of the Billings reservoir are major threats that need to be controlled.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL OF SEED RAIN AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR FOREST RESTORATION IN PERMANENT PRESERVATION AREAS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological rest-oration of degraded areas using seeds collected in forest remnants has shown significant results. This study was developed to verify the potential of seed rain to regenerate forest fragments of a Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) in the Apa River Basin which is located in the southwestern portion of the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. To develop the study, we installed 25 collectors measuring 1 m(2) each, which were systematically distributed on an area of 1.5ha. Seed gathering was conducted in a monthly basis throughout the year of 2013. A total of 26.411 propagules were identified and distributed among 50 species, 45 genera and 32 families. In terms of the propagules distribution, 70.51% were identified as trees, 22.8% as lianas, 6.5% as shrubs, 0.1 as herbaceous, 0.05% as palm and 0.05% could not be classified. The value for the Shannon Diversity Index was (H') = 1.67 and the Pielou Evenness index was (J) = 0.42. These results indicate that the seeds rain has low species diversity with the abundance of a few species. The overall results suggest that seed rain can be a potential technique for restoration of the PPAs and other forested areas. However, it is necessary to enhance the diversity of tree species.

TI  - The Potential Ecological Impact of Oil Palm Agroforestry as Term of Improvement for Restoring Harapan Rainforest
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 20.000 ha of forestland in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi Province, Indonesia, is currently under encroachment by local communities. Local communities encroach on forest land converted into oil palm plantations. Expanding oil palm plantations into forest areas led to biodiversity loss and massive carbon emissions. The annual net carbon emissions of oil palm transformation from the forest in Indonesia is around 12.41-25.83 ton ha year . Oil palm agroforestry is considered to be able to increase carbon sequestration and the biodiversity level. CRC990/EFForTS has established an oil palm agroforestry experimental plot in Jambi Province, Indonesia, namely B11 plot. This study compares the carbon sequestration and biodiversity level between oil palm monoculture and agroforestry. The data collected in this study was obtained from the CRC-990 experimental plots. We collected data on the CRC-990 oil palm agroforestry plot in 6 plots of 40 m x 40 m and 6 plots of 20 m x 20 m. We chose the location and theme of this research because, until now, no research has been conducted yet to calculate the potential carbon absorption capacity and biodiversity level of oil palm agroforestry patterns in B11 plot. This study uses an allometric equation and IPCC guidelines to estimate biomass and carbon sequestration. SNI 8014 is used to evaluate the biodiversity level. This study found that oil palm agroforestry has more significant carbon sequestration. Increasing intercropping in oil palm agroforestry will increase the amount of carbon sequestration. This study also found that oil palm agroforestry has a higher biodiversity level. The species diversity of oil palm agroforestry is moderate, while oil palm monoculture is low. These potential ecological impacts can be considered an initial step in restoring the Harapan Rainforest. It is important to choose appropriate intercrops and proper management to increase the successful implementation of oil palm agroforestry.

TI  - Germination traits explain the success of direct seeding restoration in the seasonal tropics of Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding is a major method for active restoration of tropical forests and savannas. Although seed traits such as large and rounded seeds are proxies for successful establishment, the effects of germination traits have not been investigated. The study of germination traits allows understanding how to manipulate seed and germination traits to improve the success of seedling establishment. In this study, we evaluated how germination traits are related to success of seedling emergence after direct seeding for forest and savanna trees of the Cerrado, as well as how dormancy breaking treatments modify germination traits and the success of seedling emergence. Twenty-three trees and three shrubs species from forest and savanna in the Cerrado biome were studied in the laboratory. To evaluate how dormancy breaking treatments modify germination traits, intact and pretreated seeds were sowed in a greenhouse. Data on direct seeding success of pretreated and untreated seeds were taken from the literature. Time to start imbibition had a positive effect, and seed shape (variance of seed dimensions) had a negative contribution to direct seeding success. Seed size was not significant in the presence of these variables. In the greenhouse, pretreated seeds anticipated emergence from 40 to 24 days. In field direct seeding, seedling emergence decreased from 30 % for untreated seeds to 18 % for pretreated seeds. Delayed seedling emergence is a positive strategy for direct seeding. Seed technology should target mechanisms and structures to avoid fast and synchronic emergence for direct seeding in the seasonal tropics.

TI  - Nature-based solutions are critical for putting Brazil on track towards net-zero emissions by 2050
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the world's nations (around 130) have committed to reaching net-zero carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, yet robust policies rarely underpin these ambitions. To investigate whether existing and expected national policies will allow Brazil to meet its net-zero GHG emissions pledge by 2050, we applied a detailed regional integrated assessment modelling approach. This included quantifying the role of nature-based solutions, such as the protection and restoration of ecosystems, and engineered solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Our results highlight ecosystem protection as the most critical cost-effective climate mitigation measure for Brazil, whereas relying heavily on costly and not-mature-yet engineered solutions will jeopardise Brazil's chances of achieving its net-zero pledge by mid-century. We show that the full implementation of Brazil's Forest Code (FC), a key policy for emission reduction in Brazil, would be enough for the country to achieve its short-term climate targets up to 2030. However, it would reduce the gap to net-zero GHG emissions by 38% by 2050. The FC, combined with zero legal deforestation and additional large-scale ecosystem restoration, would reduce this gap by 62% by mid-century, keeping Brazil on a clear path towards net-zero GHG emissions by around 2040. While some level of deployment of negative emissions technologies will be needed for Brazil to achieve and sustain its net-zero pledge, we show that the more mitigation measures from the land-use sector, the less costly engineered solutions from the energy sector will be required. Our analysis underlines the urgent need for Brazil to go beyond existing policies to help fight climate emergency, to align its short- and long-term climate targets, and to build climate resilience while curbing biodiversity loss.

TI  - Physicochemical characterization of quartzitic degraded soils and adjacent areas of rupestrian fields, Serra do Cipo, MG, Brazil
T2  - Neotropical Biology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - While road works are an important source of soil and landscape degradation, there are few studies on restoration of these environments. Erosive processes caused by these actions end up compromising the natural regeneration, the ability to store carbon and water in soil, decreasing its resilience in the face of intense rainfall. The impact on the safety of urban communities and ecotourism is significant. Furthermore, the lack of basic knowledge about soils and the quality of the land cover eventually become a limiting factor for land reclamation. This study aimed to compare the physical and chemical properties of degraded soils with the soils of preserved adjacent areas, along the MG-010 highway. This highway cuts through areas of rupestrian fields in the Environmental Protection Area Morro da Pedreira, next to Serra do Cipo National Park. Physicochemical analyses were made on soil samples collected in six degraded areas and their adjacent preserved areas. The soils in degraded areas differed significantly from adjacent areas in almost all chemical and physical attributes evaluated. With exception of pH and aluminium content, the degraded areas had lower soil fertility than the adjacent areas of rupestrian fields. We did not observed any substantial regeneration of local vegetation even after decades of topsoil being removed suggesting that the physical and chemical quality of these soils were the major factors that prevented their regeneration. This fact indicates that the rupestrian fields are extremely fragile environments with low resilience, requiring special strategies for ecological restoration in order to keep its biotic and abiotic peculiarities.

TI  - Monitoring of forest components reveals that exotic tree species are not always invasive in areas under ecological restoration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exotic species are known to become invasive in several ecosystems, including areas undergoing restoration. But does that always happen? We monitored the tree layer, seed rain, and regenerating layer of 10-year and 20-year-old forests under restoration in southeast Brazil to verify if planted exotic trees were behaving as invasive; if they were influencing the species richness and abundance of regenerating native plants; and the probabilities of exotic trees perpetuating over time. Data from the three forest components (trees, seed rain, and regenerating) were collected in 12 permanent plots of 100 m(2)each in each study area. Collected data were analyzed through generalized linear models (GLM) and Markov chains. We verified that exotic species were not behaving as invasive species. Of the five species planted,Acacia mangium,Syzygium cumini, andPsidium guajavawere dispersing seeds but recruiting only six new individuals. In general, the species richness and abundance of exotic trees were not related to the richness and abundance of regenerating native plants. In addition, the chances of individuals' transition between forest components were in most cases nil, so that exotic species should continue not to spread in the 10- and 20-year-old forests. We assume that biotic resistance was occurring in the assembled communities and this prevented exotic trees from behaving as invaders. Monitoring of forest components helped to better understand the role of non-native species in the dynamics of these novel ecosystems. Monitoring also indicated that not all recovering forests need management actions against exotic trees after a decade or two of restoration.

TI  - Structure and floristic composition as indicators of restoration success in an urban riparian forest along the Das Velhas river in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated a 5-year-old riparian forest in an anthropogenically affected region along the Das Velhas River in southeastern Brazil, restored with the purposes of erosion control and other ecosystem functions and to monitor indicators of structure and composition. The forest was monitored via data collection of the diameter and height of trees for phytosociological analysis, including the identification of species and their classification with regard to life form, origin, weed-status, and successional stage. The forest was not very structurally developed and, overall, 111 species were recorded consisting of 65.8% herbs, 24.3% trees, and 9.9% other types of life forms. About 70.9% of species were natives, 29.1% exotics, and 65% weeds. The high abundance of exotic species and weed species (some aggressive such as Leucaena leucocephala) of various life forms may negatively affect the restoration success in terms of seedling recruitment and diversity of native species, but may constitute a neutral or even positive accomplishment for erosion control (with species composition as a secondary effect). Results also reinforce the knowledge that choice of species for restoration must be in accordance with major local filters (e.g., floods), and areas within urban matrices may deserve special attention, including periodic management actions to control undesirable species.

TI  - Forest Seedlings Supply for Restoration of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Half of the territory in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state is composed of degraded areas. This work evaluated the profile, distribution, and production capacity of plant nurseries in RJ which produce forest seedlings, as well as their species??? richness. The potential to meet the increased demand arising from environmental commitments in different hydrographic regions was also analyzed. We identified 81 active forest seedling nurseries and 73 of them participated in our interview, by adopting a regional survey. Nearly one-third of the nurseries closed down in this region in the last decade. A high richness of species in the nurseries (977 species, 99 native species/nursery) was found, representing 22% of the regional flora. Most of this species??? richness is exclusively produced by small nurseries. The current production of the nurseries is capable of supplying less than 1% of the potential demand for seedlings for restoring priority watershed areas in the state.

TI  - Floristic and structural characterization of a forest fragment in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul State
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of the structure and composition of forest species together with the understanding of the formation of floristic groups is an important subsidy for the definition of conservation and restoration strategies. The present study analyzed the structure, diversity and floristic clusters of a forest fragment with a history of degradation, in the State Park Quarta Colonia, central region of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2012, tree individuals with CBH >= 15 cm were evaluated in 16 plots of 10x10 m. For analysis of the floristic structure density and frequency were calculated in absolute data, Shannon diversity (H') and Pielou equability (J). The vegetation characterization was performed through the cluster analysis, using the Twinspan method. The fragment presented groups in the early and advanced stages of succession. Among the raised species Escallonia bifida was highlighted as an indicator in the formation of floristic groups of open areas. The high values of density and frequency of the species also characterize it as the most important in the horizontal structure of the forest fragment, demonstrating potential for use in restoration actions.

TI  - GERMINATION AND SEEDLINGS DEVELOPMENT OF THE THREATENED SPECIES Quillaja brasiliensis
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is a mega diverse country, but as consequence of habitat degradation several plant species are threatened. Quillaja brasiliensis is a rare and threatened tree species of the temperate forests of South America. We investigated protocols for germination, seedling growth and transplantation. We discuss some ecological matters that could affect the species' establishment. We evaluated germination under a range of storage periods, temperature and light conditions, the effects of transplantation and the development of seedlings under two sowing methods. We found that seeds germinated rapidly and have a high germination rate. Temperature influenced germination vigour, and photoperiod influenced synchrony. There was increased and faster germination under controlled culture conditions. The high germination rate and rapid growth qualify Q. brasiliensis as a potential species for restoring degraded areas and enrichment programmes.

TI  - DAILY AND SEASONAL VARIATION OF SOIL RESPIRATION IN A SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUAL ATLANTIC FOREST FRAGMENT AND A RESTORATION SITE IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest soils have a large capacity of stocking and cycling carbon, incorporated by organic matter and evaded by roots and soil microbiota as CO2. Soil respiration can indicate ecosystem processes, but little is known about the successional, seasonal and diurnal variation in CO2 flux. This study presents estimations of soil CO2 efflux in a seasonal Atlantic forest fragment (FF) and an adjacent 15 years-old restoration site (RS), in two seasons (winter-dry and summer-rainy), during 24-hour periods, in southern Brazil. Measurements were performed with an infrared gas analyser at 2-hour intervals. Respiration rates were 50% higher in the rainy season, both in FF (261, against 135 mg m-2 s-1 in the dry season) and RS (237 and 127 mg m-2 s-1), indicating that higher humidity and temperature promoted higher soil biota activity. The soil respiration was higher at FF only in the dry season, revealing that this environment may be less sensitive to water limitation. Greater overnight respiration was observed in the dry season for both sites, likely reflecting more intense microbial metabolism at night in this season. There was no rainy season diurnal variation. Seasonal and daily variation suggests that soil respiration in the RS is more sensitive to warmer and dryer conditions.

TI  - Overcoming socio-ecological vulnerability through community-based social learning: the case of Lomba do Pinheiro in Porto Alegre, Brazil
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based initiatives and collective learning practices are key themes in sustainability transition processes. This paper presents the results of a participatory study that investigated a local initiative in the community of Lomba do Pinheiro in south Brazil to examine social learning processes in the context of socio-ecological vulnerability. In this community, a group composed of local residents and members representing the public sector and local educational institutions has promoted several learning-oriented actions aimed at restoring a degraded local watershed and improving residents' livelihoods. This study used social learning as a lens through which the initiative enacted by this group may be understood, and analysed how local conditions, determined by a context of vulnerability, have influenced local processes. We applied a multi-dimensional analytical framework that included individual, collective, and territorial dimensions. The analysis focused on the leading group, the individuals who comprise it, and their actions in the territory, while considering local constraints. Our findings highlight the importance of (1) shared values, mutual trust, and affective bonds for group cohesion as well as concerted action, equalisation of diverse languages within the group, knowledge integration, and initiative persistence; (2) a practical-reflexive approach based on a sequence of actions that catalyses group learning and facilitates advancement within the wider community; and (3) the role of inter-sectoral articulations and the establishment of partnerships to support actions. This paper raises questions about the limits of an exclusively bottom-up approach to solve complex problems in the context of extremely precarious conditions.

TI  - Tree logs for grassland restoration? Lessons from an unintentional experiment
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For subtropical Brazilian grasslands, few restoration techniques are established, and seeds of native grassland species are not available on the market. Here, we evaluated the effect of physical barriers (PB) on vegetation recovery in a degraded grassland. We considered species that exhibit attributes in their diaspores that facilitate dispersal as well-dispersed species (WDS) and compared the proportion of WDS at our site to their proportion in the regional species pool. To analyze plots near and distant from the PB, we calculated the extrapolated metrics by an asymptotic estimator (double sample size of each distance). We found 74 species in the degraded area, with higher richness and Shannon diversity values closer to logs, but higher Simpson values with larger distance from logs. Almost half of the species in the degraded area are WDS, more than in the regional species pool. While effects of logs on microsite conditions may also play a role (e.g. logs accumulating organic material or increasing soil moisture, providing shade), our data indicates that the PB works as a seed trap favoring the occurrence of WDS. It seems promising to develop applications in restoration, especially when associating PB with other restoration techniques to increase availability of adequate germination and establishment conditions.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF FLORISTIC AND STRUCTURE OF PRIMARY FOREST FOR SELECTING KEY SPECIES THROUGH MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS FOR CONSERVATION OF MINED FOREST AREAS IN THE PROTECTED AREA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Amazon, several mining companies are located in protected areas. Ecological restoration after mining should consider several attributes. Among these, there is the need of the restored ecosystem to contain a set of key species that occur in the reference ecosystem, and thus, provide an appropriate structure of the community, and as much as possible a greatest number of native species. The objective of this work was to analyze a phytosociological index and socioeconomic status (IFSE), obtained by multivariate analysis. The model included six quantitative variables (abundance, frequency, dominance, biomass, commercial value of timber and amount of non-timber forest products) and an equal number of qualitative variables. In a rain forest area of 1,321 ha, 315 plots of 0.25 ha were sampled where all trees with DBH >= 10 cm were identified and measured. It was identified 36,298 individuals, distributed in 898 species, and comprising 62 families. Using the proposed index the species, they were ranked in three categories of priority-phytosociological and socioeconomic (high, medium and low). The appropriateness of factor analysis was determined by KMO and Bartlett tests. The Bartlett test evaluated the general significance of the correlation matrix at the level of 1% probability. The KMO test showed that the variables are correlated and factor model presented a very good fit to the data. The use of multivariate analysis was statistically validated using the IFSE. Among the 898 species analyzed, 25 were selected as priorities (high and medium categories) and are recognized as key species. It was estimated the planting density of these species for recovery of mined areas in the Amazon, with biological and environmental conditions similar to those reported in this study. The diameter distribution of key species was analyzed and compared with the forest inventoried. The successional stage of key species was also analyzed.

TI  - Water-table responses to storms in forested, drained and ditch-blocked tropical peatlands, Sebangau, Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of hydrological restoration, usually using ditch dams, on water-table responses to storms in drained tropical peatlands are poorly understood. We collected hourly rainfall and water-level data during the dry and wet seasons (August 2019 to January 2020) at a forested peatland (Forested), a drained peatland with ditch dams (Blocked), and a drained peatland without ditch dams (Drained) in Sebangau National Park, Indonesia. Hydraulic conductivity of the surface peat and bulk density of the peat profiles were also measured. The two main components of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) could explain 62 % to 68 % of the variation of water-table responses to storms at the study sites. The responses were related to the initial water table, the depth and the duration of the storm, and the position within a site with respect to ditches. In Forested, the mean of the post-storm water-level drawdown speed (DSpeed) was 0.039 cm hour-1 (SD = 0.024 cm hour-1) when the water table was deeper than 50 cm below the surface but 0.047 cm hour-1 (SD = 0.039 cm hour-1) when within the upper 50 cm. In Drained/Blocked, DSpeed varied greatly with depth, distance to ditches, and distance to the main outlet of ditches. Ditch dams alone may not recover the water-table responses to storms in drained tropical peatlands when compared to more intact forested systems.

TI  - Conservation alliances with indigenous peoples of the Amazon
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing alliances between. indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the Brazilian Amazon have helped achieve the official recognition of similar to 1 million km(2) of indigenous lands. The future of Amazonian indigenous reserves is of strategic importance for the fate Of biodiversity in the region. We examined the legislation governing resource use on indigenous lands and summarize the history of the Kayapo people's consolidation of their > 100,000 km(2) territory. Like many Amazonian indigenous peoples, the Kayapo have halted the expansion of the agricultural frontier on their lands but allow selective logging and gold mining. Prospects for long-term conservation and sustainability in these lands depend on indigenous peoples' understandings of their resource base and on available economic alternatives. Although forest conservation is not guaranteed by either tenure security or indigenous knowledge, indigenous societies' relatively egalitarian common property resource management regimes-along with adequate incentives and long-term partnerships with conservation organizations-can achieve this result. Successful initiatives include Conservation International's long-term project with the A'ukre Kayapo village and incipient large-scale territorial monitoring and control in the Kayapo territory, and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) 15-year partnership with the peoples of the Xingu Indigenous Park, with projects centered on territorial monitoring and control, education, community organization, and economic alternatives. The recent agreement on ecological restoration of the Xingu River headwaters between ranchers and private companies, indigenous peoples, and environmentalists, brokered by ISA, marks the emergence of an indigenous and conservation alliance of sufficient cohesiveness and legitimacy to negotiate effectively at a regional scale.

TI  - Linkages of peatland degradation and rural poverty in development scenarios of peatland restoration
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, peatland degradation continues due to drainage for industrial plants (Oil palm and Acacia), so their productivity continues to decline and rural communities are very dependent on peatlands, hence the poverty problem in rural areas remains unresolved. Due to a lack of government policies that adequately recognize the benefits and functions of peatland ecosystems, it seems that the government is adopting a hierarchical and structured approach to planning and permitting peatland degradation, which is contingent upon the growth of rural economic development within these communities. This research aims to analyze the relationship between peatland degradation and rural poverty in peatland restoration development scenarios. This research was conducted between 2020 and 2023 in South Sumatra, Indonesia and the data collected was analyzed using qualitative methods. The real facts indicated that government policies were more in favor of large investors (not rural communities). In these circumstances, rural communities typically operated by the tenet of "first come, first served," making illicit logging and slash-and-burn farming acceptable forms of livelihood. Therefore, in this research compiling concepts and linkages of agricultural land degradation and rural poverty is the way to solve the problems. The government needs to restore them utilizing three key development scenarios, namely revegetation;

TI  - The underestimated role of small fragments for carnivore dispersal in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing protected areas capable of supporting organism flow is critical for species persistence across wide scales. Here, we evaluated the capacity and protection level of forest fragments to sustain connectivity for carnivores in the Atlantic Forest. We simulated potential dispersal considering species spatial demands and quantified the importance of patches with different sizes in sustaining species movement. We found that patches smaller than species home-range size represented more than 95% of the patches used during species dispersal. These small remnants play a key role in upholding connectivity for carnivores, especially for species capable of moving long distances. Although the forest structure did support most species movements, our results showed that some species must cross matrices composed by crops and pasture to complete their trajectories. Moreover, between 29% and 70% of the area around the species' movement paths, which could act as potential corridors, overlap with human activities. Current established protected areas - mainly targeted for sustainable use - cover only 15% of the entire extension of small remnants enrolled in species dispersal. We reinforce that conservation efforts should not overlook the potential of small forest fragments to improve connectivity. Integrating key fragments with forest restoration and matrix management would benefit long-term species persistence. (C) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

TI  - Intraspecific variation of leaf traits in tree plantings of different ages in a tropical forest
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Response functional traits are characteristics related to how organisms respond to variations in abiotic or biotic factors, which can vary along an environmental gradient. Variations in traits within a community arise due to the arrival or departure of species, but also due to variation across individuals of the same species. The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess differences in the intraspecific variation (ITV) of leaf traits in restoration sites of different ages in a tropical forest; (ii) to observe if species of the same ecological group exhibit similar variation in resource use traits over time; and (iii) to assess the relationships between pairs of traits for each species at different sites. The tree species Alchornea triplinervia, Calophyllum brasiliense, Guarea guidonia, Inga laurina, and Pseudobombax grandiflorum were evaluated in 5-, 13-, and 25-year-old plantings in an area of Atlantic Forest. The results showed that, for most traits, the highest ITV was observed in the oldest planting and the species did not show equivalence in the pattern of trait changes, regardless of their ecological group. Most correlations between pairs of traits differed among plantations of different ages. We showed that intraspecific variation does not necessarily occur in a similar way among species of the same ecological group and suggest that ITV in a given area is related to environmental rather than ontogenetic factors. We also demonstrated that even well-established correlations between pairs of traits do not always persist over time.

TI  - Fertilization and containers in the seedlings production and post-planting survival of Schizolobium parahyba
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fertilization in the production of forest seedlings can vary according to the substrate, container and fertilizer used in the nursery. Controlled release fertilizers (CRF) can be applied to reduce or even to eliminate the need for top-dress fertilization. The CRF doses can vary according to the container volume, considering the different amount of substrate available for seedlings in different containers. This study aimed to evaluate the growth of Schizolobium parahyba seedlings produced in plastic tubes of 110 and 280 cm(3) , with different doses of CRF (15-09-12) (0, 3, 6 e 12 kg m(-3)), as well as the seedlings survival and the initial growth after post-planting in the northern region of Rio de Janeiro state. The study was conducted using a factorial design 2 x 4 (tube volumes x CRF doses), with five repetitions for each treatment. As substrate it was used sewage sludge from urban areas, which was dried in open air beds. The growth of seedlings at nursery was evaluated at 93 days after the transplant, and the survival and initial growth at five and twelve months after planting. The Schizolobium parahyba seedlings showed higher growth in 280 cm(3) tubes and responded positively to the CRF application, where the most efficient dose was 8.3 kg cm(3) for this plastic tube. Twelve months after planting, seedlings from all treatments showed survival below 80%, being under the standard recommended for forest restoration. The mortality of seedlings occurred in consequence of five months of water deficit in a sandy clay loam soil. Considering only nursery data, the combination of 280 cm(3 )plastic tubes, with the CRF dose of 8.3 kg cm(3) are recommended to produce Schizolobium parahyba seedlings.

TI  - Bee pollinator functional responses and functional effects in restored tropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild pollinators are necessary for ensuring plant reproduction, not only among crop fields but also remnant and restored ecosystems. Restoration activities should, therefore, lead to wild pollinator recovery, and thus be monitored to evaluate effects on pollinator diversity and functionality. We assessed bee pollinator functional responses in restoration plantings by creating functional groups (traits: body size, nesting location, sociality, and foraging strategy), comparing their abundance and diversity to that of other habitats (i.e., conserved and degraded primary forest fragments, anthropogenic wetlands, and sugarcane fields), and testing for an effect of source habitat (i.e., primary forest fragments) isolation. We analyzed functional effects on pollen transportation by identifying the pollen grains attached on the bodies of bees; creating plant functional groups with the identified species (traits: habit, successional class, geographic origin, and pollination mode); comparing their frequency, diversity, and interaction network structure among habitats; and searching for key interactions in network modules. In general, the abundance and diversity of bee communities and the frequency and diversity of the interacting plant species in restoration plantings were lower than those in primary forest fragments but higher than those in anthropogenic wetlands and sugarcane fields, suggesting that restoration plantings better enhance bee community recovery and functionality than other disturbed habitats. The interacting bees and plants were also negatively affected by habitat isolation, demonstrating the importance of primary forest fragments to supply bee populations to restored sites. The structure of interaction networks was little affected by habitat change and isolation, but the composition and diversity of functional groups varied significantly. There were more effects on larger bee species with more restricted nesting and floral requirements, and the woody species with which they interact most frequently. We identified key functional groups of bee pollinators that deserve priority for conservation because they play an important role in the pollen transportation of some the most relevant species in remnant forests and restoration plantings and also respond more negatively to habitat disturbances. Restoration efforts should include provisioning of nesting resources and management and conservation of primary forest remnant fragments that represent source habitats for them.

TI  - Coupled Ground- and Space-Based Assessment of Regional Inundation Dynamics to Assess Impact of Local and Upstream Changes on Evaporation in Tropical Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modifications of human land use and climate change are known to be a threat for the health and proper functioning of tropical wetlands. They interfere with the seasonal flood pulse, which is seen as the most important driver for biodiversity and directly controls evaporation. In order to investigate the impact of local and upstream changes on wetlands, a regional assessment of evaporation is crucial but challenging in such often remote and poorly gauged ecosystems. Evaporation is the major water balance component of these wetlands and links the flood pulse with the ecosystem. It can therefore be seen as a proxy for their functioning. In the last decades, information from space became an important data source to assess remote wetland areas. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify regional evaporation driven by inundation dynamics as its dominant control. We used three water and vegetation indices (mNDWI (modified Normalized Difference Water Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance products to assess regional inundation dynamics between the dry and wet seasons. Two years of continual in situ water level measurements at different locations in our study area, the Pantanal wetland of South America, provided the reference to evaluate our method. With process-based modeling that used the inundation dynamics to determine the water available for evaporation, we were able to estimate actual evaporation (AET) on a regional scale. Relating AET to changes in discharge due to upstream flow modifications and on local precipitation over the last 13 years, we found that the Pantanal is more vulnerable to alternated inundation dynamics than to changes in local precipitation. We concluded that coupling ground- and space-based information in this remote wetland area is a valuable first step to investigate the status of the Pantanal ecosystem.

TI  - Evaluating the nodulation status of leguminous species from the Amazonian forest of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous leguminous species are used or have potential uses for timber production, pharmacological products, or land reclamation. Through N-2-fixation, many leguminous trees contribute to the N-balance of tropical wetlands and rainforests. Therefore, studies of the N-2-fixation ability of leguminous species appear to be crucial for the better use and conservation of these resources. The global nodulation inventory in the Leguminosae family is constantly being enriched with new records, suggesting the existence of undiscovered nodulated species, especially in tropical natural ecosystems and other hot spots of biodiversity. In this respect, the nodulation of leguminous species from the Amazonian forest of Porto Trombetas (Brazil) was surveyed. Overall, 199 leguminous species from flooded and non-flooded areas, were examined for their nodulation status by combining field observations, seedling inoculations, and screening of N-2-fixing bacterial strains from the collected nodules. The results revealed a tendency for a higher relative frequency of nodulation in the species from the flooded areas (74%) compared with those from the non-flooded areas (67%). Nodulation was observed in the Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, with 25, 88, and 84% of the examined species in each subfamily, respectively. Of the 137 nodulated leguminous species, 32 including three Caesalpinoideae, 19 Mimosoideae, and 10 Papilionoideae are new records. One new nodulated genus (Cymbosema) was found in the Papilionoideae. Twelve non-nodulating leguminous species were also observed for the first time. The results are discussed based on the systematics of the Leguminosae family and the influence of available nutrients to the legume-bacteria symbiosis.

TI  - Assessment of Burned Areas during the Pantanal Fire Crisis in 2020 Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal biome-a tropical wetland area-has been suffering a prolonged drought that started in 2019 and peaked in 2020. This favored the occurrence of natural disasters and led to the 2020 Pantanal fire crisis. The purpose of this work was to map the burned area's extent during this crisis in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal biome using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The classification of the burned areas was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Input variables in the algorithm were the percentiles 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 of monthly (July to December) mosaics of the shade fraction, NDVI, and NBR images derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images. The results showed an overall accuracy of 95.9% and an estimate of 44,998 km(2) burned in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal, which resulted in severe ecosystem destruction and biodiversity loss in this biome. The burned area estimated in this work was higher than those estimated by the MCD64A1 (35,837 km(2)), Fire_cci (36,017 km(2)), GABAM (14,307 km(2)), and MapBiomas Fogo (23,372 km(2)) burned area products, which presented lower accuracies. These differences can be explained by the distinct datasets and methods used to obtain those estimates. The proposed approach based on Sentinel-2 images can potentially refine the burned area's estimation at a regional scale and, consequently, improve the estimate of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning, where global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale. Our study brings to light the necessity of developing approaches that aim to improve data and theory about the impacts of fire in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal, in order to improve Earth systems models that forecast wetland-atmosphere interactions, and the role of these fires on current and future climate change over these regions.

TI  - Forest Landscape Restoration governance: a case study from Espírito Santo, Brazil
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the governance of forest landscape restoration (FLR) in Esp & iacute;rito Santo, Brazil, based on its FLR initiatives and social actors. We discuss enabling conditions for the FLR governance system to upscale the total restored area and to involve farmers in FLR initiatives in Ita & uacute;nas and S & aring;o Mateus watersheds. Data were collected through interviews and participatory workshops between 2018 and 2020. We identified 22 initiatives - programs, projects and actions - between 2001 and 2021, coordinated by public and private social actors. The initiatives refer to the FLR chain development, land use plans and assessments, the payment for environmental services programs, academic research, technical assistance and actions to raise awareness of rural producers. The FLR network is made up of different social actors engaged in multiple FLR initiatives and led mainly by public actors. Human and social capital, institutional arrangements and financial resources present in the initiatives point to a path for the advancement of forest restoration and the participation of farmers.

TI  - Forest age strongly influences the functional trajectories of reintroduced vascular epiphytes over time
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Active restoration has helped vascular epiphytes colonize forests where they are absent or insufficiently abundant. This study was the first attempt to assess how reintroduced epiphytes adjust and acclimate over time through changes in leaf traits in restored forests. Four epiphyte species were monitored over a year in one forest aged six years and one forest aged over 20 years in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. The younger forest has a more heterogeneous canopy structure. Eight leaf traits were analyzed individually or in a multivariate manner. The effects of within- and between-forest heterogeneity and time on trait variation were assessed by PCA, GLMM, and variance partitioning analyses. Our findings supported half of the four hypotheses. First, the hypothesis that individuals would show more variation in trait values and trait spaces in the younger forest was supported, as in this forest, trait hypervolumes became larger and showed greater overlaps with the initial hypervolumes. Second, the hypothesis that trait variation would be more pronounced in the rainy season was not supported; however, time significantly influenced the trajectory of trait variation. Third, the hypothesis that within-forest heterogeneity would drive most of the trait variance was supported, as this factor contributed 71 %, on average, to the variance across traits and species. Fourth, the hypothesis that the timing and magnitude of changes would depend on the species' ecological strategy was not confirmed, as all species showed similar patterns. Our findings suggest that deciding where epiphytes should be reintroduced will strongly influence their functional trajectories over time.

TI  - Fauna Associated with Brushwood Transposition in a Mining Area in the South of Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the potential of fauna attractiveness according to brushwood transposition in an abandoned mining area under restoration in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Sixteen areas of brushwood measuring 2 m(2) area and 1 m high were installed. The occurrence of fauna groups under and around the brushwood piles was then observed with use of bi-monthly surveys. Data were collected using a non-destructive method and the animals were identified by order and separated by taxonomic units. Twenty-three fauna orders were found, with the most frequent being Anura, Araneae, Hymenoptera and Isoptera. There was an increase in the number of taxonomic units found in each survey, with a significant difference after ten months of installation. The results indicate that the brushwood was attractive to the fauna and provided new habitats and coexistence between different fauna groups during the monitored period.

TI  - Deep soil carbon loss offsets rapid aboveground carbon accumulation after reforestation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international "4 per 1000 '' Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 +/- 15 Mg ha (-1), significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 +/- 13 Mg ha(-1)) and agroforestry system (25 +/- 5 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha(- 1) below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies.

TI  - Shade and sapling size influence restoration of Araucaria angustifolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Toward improving reforestation of Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia), two contrasting sapling sizes in either full sun or in the shade of a mixed plantation and the effect of opening the canopy were evaluated for survival, growth, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, and leaf anatomy 18 months after being planted. At 23 months after planting, a partial opening was made in the canopy in the mixed plantation, then the saplings were evaluated again after 2 months for the same morphophysiological traits. After 18 months, saplings planted in the full sun had higher survival, growth, pigments, and photosynthesis compared to the shaded saplings. Large saplings had higher survival and growth compared to the small ones. Shaded leaves were thinner and little differentiation of palisade parenchyma and hypodermis. After opening of the canopy, photosynthetically active radiation was 10 times higher, and the saplings quickly grew in height due to increased photosynthesis. Thus, although the species can tolerate shade, growth in the shade is limited. We recommend that for reforestation purposes of Brazilian pine, large saplings should be selected and planted in the open for better development.

TI  - Suitability index for restoration in landscapes: An alternative proposal for restoration projects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class "wood sites" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOIL SEED BANK AND CANOPY COVERAGE IN A MINED AREA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate and correlate information about soil seed bank and canopy (%Canopy Openness and Leaf area index-LAI) in a mined area in restoration process through natural regeneration. The study area is located in Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais, which presents predominance of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, and has an area of 0.5 ha in process of natural regeneration after six years of bauxite exploitation (without any intervention). Along the area, ten plots of 45x29cm were allocated and distributed in the best way to represent the whole area in restoration process. Seed bank diversity and canopy characteristics were evaluated in these plots, the last one using a NIKON D40X photographic camera, with fisheye lens of 8mm. As results, 8280 individuals (tree, shrub, herbs, and vines) were found, totaling 51 species and 24 botanical families. The Shannon diversity index (H') was 2.770, and the equability (J) was 0.705, which demonstrate an average diversity in this area, with a density of 2114.94 germinated seeds m(-2). Through the evaluation of the seed bank, the presence of exotic species (23.5%), the dominance of the pioneer species (68.6%), as well as high dispersal by wind (52.9%) were verified in the area. According to canopy characteristics, a significant variation between different points/regions within the study area was found, while patterns of existence of certain herbs as a function of canopy openness (lower vegetal cover/clearings) were also identified, as well as in response to spatial proximity between the allocated plots, confirming the high correlation between these two variables and their importance in the process of forest restoration.

TI  - Multiparameter analysis of small non-flying mammals' response to forest restoration post-bauxite mining in eastern Amazonia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bauxite mining has been caused severe changes in the natural ecosystems of the Amazon, but the restoration of these areas is mandatory by federal law in Brazil. The recolonization of fauna is crucial to establishing the ecological functions of recovering forests, and the small nonflying mammals can stand out in this process. Assessing taxonomic and functional diversity parameters, we demonstrated that in the early stages of forest recovery post-bauxite mining, between 6 and 11 years, it is possible to restore approximately 45% of the richness of small non-flying mammal species from the original habitats, that in this case were altered Primary Forests. However, the species richness parameter alone does not reflect the recovery of taxonomic or functional diversity at this stage of forest succession. Although 34.8% of the species composition is shared between the Altered Primary Forest and Forest Areas in Restoration, the abundance distribution per species is less balanced in the latter habitat. The areas did not exhibit significant difference between the functional divergence and functional evenness of ecological functions performed by small nonflying mammals; however, they present differences in terms of the functional richness. We also observed that some functional traits of species, such as larger body mass, are more closely related to the structural characteristics of the Primary Forest, such as high basal area values, litter and percentage forest cover. In the forest recovery areas, we observed a predominance of terrestrial species and those with granivorous and insectivorous diets. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of applying different taxonomic and functional diversity parameters to understand better the fauna recovery patterns in degraded areas undergoing restoration.

TI  - Short-term modifications of mycorrhizal fungi, glomalin and soil attributes in a tropical agroforestry
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community and the Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) they produce plays important roles in maintaining soil ecosystem functions, promoting ecological restoration, and are important for monitoring changes in soil health from land use change. This research addressed the subtle modifications of AMF and GRSP in different land use types and their association with soil properties. Our objectives were: 1) to assess land use effects on AMF spore density, diversity, and composition besides glomalin fractions (EEG, easily extracted GRSP; TG, total GRSP), and 2) to quantify the relationships between glomalin, AMF community metrics, soil organic carbon (SOC), and key soil quality parameters. Soils were collected in the dry and rainy seasons of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of agroforestry systems (AS1, A52 and A53), an unmanaged pasture and a secondary forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Linear mixed-effects model and multivariate analyses showed that land uses had influenced the AMF community, meanly at the family level. On the other hand, seasonality has not proved to be an essential factor that modulates the changes of the AMF community and glomalin production. The management practices had influenced AMF sporulation and the number of total species in agroforestry systems. Glomalin is a potential contributor for SOC, mainly in agroforestry systems and pasture plots. Moreover, we found a correlation between the AMF community and key soil parameters. For example, most of the AMF families and spore density were positively correlated with the stability of soil aggregates and SOC. Our findings shed light on that land-use change can shift the AMF community, glomalin and their relationship to key soil quality parameters. Moreover, the adoption of agroforestry systems indicates maintenance of biodiversity and other soil quality parameters with future implications for their use to recover degraded areas.

TI  - Seed dormancy overcoming as a strategy for forest restoration in tropical pasture
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of seed dormancy overcoming treatments on the rate and time of emergence of Fabaceae tree species, and on their recruitment when reintroduced in a tropical pasture, in the Brazilian Cerrado. Experiments were carried out in greenhouse and field (Urochloa brizantha pasture), with the species Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Peltophorum dubium, Pterogyne nitens, Dimorphandra mollis, Copaifera langsdorffii and Hymenaea stigonocarpa, subjected or not to the following treatments of dormancy break: D. monis and H. stigonocarpa, mechanical scarification; C. langsdorffii and M caesapiniifolia, chemical scarification with H2SO4; P nitens, tegument puncture; and P dubium, immersion in water at 80 degrees C. Recruitment of plants in the field were followed up for 21 months. Dormancy overcoming promoted greater emergency in four out of the six tested species, in the greenhouse, and in five species in the field. Furthermore, it reduced the emergency timing of the species and increased the recruitment of M caesalpiniifolia, P nitens, D. mollis e H. stigonocarpa, at 127 days, and of H. stigonocarpa at 659 days. Seed dormancy overcoming treatments can increase the efficiency of direct seeding in restoration projects of degraded areas in the Cerrado, promoting greater seed emergency and the recruitment of plants.

T2  - REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape transformation caused by economical activities generates impacts on natural ecosystems and the water system is one of the most susceptible to anthropic alterations. In this context, the objective of this study was to analyze the vulnerability of the water resources of the Lobo Stream Drainage Basin (LSDB), Itirapina-SP, through the application of the Environmental Quality Index of Water Resources (EQI-Hydro), in a 32 years period, corresponding to the years 1985 and 2017. The EQI-Hydro was calculated from the analysis of the Euclidean distance of the water resources to the impacting sources, determined by means of land use classification, and then rescaled based on fuzzy logic. The results show that approximately 57% of the watershed area is classified as high and very high EQI-Hydro. The Itaqueri River and the Agua Branca Stream are the most vulnerable to pollution due to their proximity to pollution sources. This manifests the need for adequate agricultural practices and public policies for forest restoration, aiming the preservation of the LSDB water resources.

TI  - Restoration of Pasture to Forest in Brazil's Mata Atlantica: The Roles of Herbivory, Seedling Defenses, and Plot Design in Reforestation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, seedling growth and herbivory were monitored during the first 4 years of plot development in a large-scale reforestation experiment in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atlantica). Seedlings were planted in a factorial design testing two levels of density, three levels of diversity, and the presence or absence of pioneer species at the Reserva Natural Vale in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. In addition, we studied the effect of herbivory on seedling growth and the potential for plant defenses to limit herbivory. Seedling growth was higher in the low-density plantings, and seedlings attained the greatest height in the low-diversity plots, which had a higher density of fast-growing species. The inclusion of pioneer species resulted in a significant decrease in the growth of neighboring seedlings. Interactions between herbivory, plant defenses, and seedling growth were complex. In general, defenses such as saponins and leaf toughness reduced herbivory, but when herbivory was high, seedling growth was reduced. Across treatments, mean height without herbivore damage was 240.8 cm, and with 50% herbivory mean height was 101.5 cm. Overall, to limit insect damage and promote seedling success, plant defense characteristics and ecological interactions should be carefully considered in reforestation projects.

AB  - It is essential that the evaluation of official development assistance (ODA) projects is conducted based on empirical research for the performance and improvement of the project. This study intended to quantitatively figure out the actual status and performance of ODA projects. The performance of the Rumpin Seed Source and Nursery Center project implemented by the KOICA was evaluated in items of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability, which are OECD Development Assistance Committee(DAC) evaluation criteria. From August 26, 2019 to August 29, 2019, a survey was conducted on 50 visitors and 54 stakeholders of the Rumpin Seed Source and Nursery Center.Through on-site survey, problems in the donation project and operation in Indonesia were identified and measures for improvement was grasped. As a result of the study, the value scored by OECD DAC evaluation criteria of the Rumpin Seed Source and Nursery Center project based on the Economic Development Cooperation Fund(EDCF) evaluation grade was evaluated as a very successful class in all items. The average score of the recognition question was 4.08 points for visitors and 4.08 points for stakeholders, and the average score for the satisfaction question was 4.37 points for visitors and 4.11 points for stakeholders, which were high overall in both groups. The main factor that affects the project awareness of the visitors was the fact that the Rumpin Seed Source and Nursery Center was created based on Korean technology, and it was confirmed that Indonesia's own items related to sim- ilar projects had a great influence on the project satisfaction. In the case of stakeholders, project sup- port in Korea affected their recognition, and it was found that relevance, efficiency, effectiveness items had the greatest impact on the level of project satisfaction of stakeholders derived from the DAC in- dividual evaluation results. Efforts are required to increase the main factors by reflecting the results of each item and to preserve and maintain the project. This study is significant in determining the per- formance of the ODA project based on empirical data, and it is believed that it can be used as basic data for supplementing and strengthening the project in the future.

TI  - Morphological and phenological strategies for flooding tolerance in Cerrado and Pantanal trees: implications for restoration under new legislation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2012, the Native Vegetation Protection Law 12,651 decreased the extent of Areas of Permanent Preservation in Brazil. While previously the distance from water was measured during the rainy season, the new version only considered the extent of the regular watercourse. This change affects conservation and restoration sites, and restoration programs need to be modified based on the new legislation. For instance, more flood-tolerant species need to be planted, given the higher probability that restoration efforts will be lost during flooding. To identify species suitable for the restoration of such areas, we tested if plants that develop morphological structures to tolerate waterlogging stress are more resistant to hypoxia caused by flooding and can recover better afterwards. We experimentally evaluated survival and morphological or phenological strategies (root dry mass, height, basal diameter, adventitious roots, lenticels, and leaf renewal) of 13 tree species from the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes of Brazil. After 56 days of simulated inundation and 56 days of post-inundation recovery, we found that all study species were able to survive on waterlogged soil and to recover after the flood, and they can be used to restore periodically flooded riparian forests within the new legal zone. Our study is particularly relevant, as climate change is expected to increase flooding. As environmental laws change and new areas get restored including those in artificially flooded areas, such as on banks of hydroelectric dams, the experimental approach introduced in this study should be replicated with other species from various phytogeographic domains worldwide.

TI  - Planning for conservation and restoration under climate and land use change in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants.LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent.ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios.Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

TI  - THE ROLE OF BACCHARIS (ASTERACEAE) SHRUBS IN THE SHORT-TERM RESTORATION OF ATLANTIC RAINFOREST
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of nurse species on degraded sites of Permanently Protected Areas represents a useful strategy for vegetation recovery in riparian forest. Species of the genus Baccharis (Asteraceae) have been documented as potential nurse plants being able of restructuring the native plant community. This study was aimed to evaluate the potential nursing role of Baccharis dracunculifolia in the recovery of a native plant community of a degraded Atlantic rainforest in a short-time period. The study was developed in two abandoned pasture areas in a riparian forest in the River Piranga basin, one in which B. dracunculifolia was planted (Restored treatment) to promote restoration, and a second area with no intervention (Degraded = Control treatment). Sampling took place 18 months after the planting of B. dracunculifolia. We set up 20 plots of 2 x 2 m in each treatment type (n = 40 plots), where all plant species were recorded (with the exception of the introduced Baccharis individuals and grasses), classifying them as native, ruderal, or alien. Plant richness was twice higher in the Restored treatment than the Degraded treatment. Furthermore, the observed values of alpha, gamma and beta diversity were also higher in Restored treatment. Restored treatment had 17 exclusive native species, while the Degraded treatment had only three non-exclusive native species. In addition, fewer ruderal and alien species were recorded in the restored plots with B. dracunculifolia compared to degraded plots. We concluded that, even in a short time period, planting B. dracunculifolia had a positive effect on promoting the assembly of the native plant community and possibly decreasing the chances of invasion by alien species.

TI  - Restored versus reference ecosystem: case study of plant community at a riparian forest in the Cerrado region, Assis, Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - Hoehnea
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether or not the structure and composition of natural ecosystems can be recovered by ecological restoration is a controversial issue, and the relative contribution of the planted species or seed sources from the vicinity has rarely been assessed. We compared the understory of a planted and a native riparian forest on the basis of density, richness and proportions of functional attributes of individuals and species. Floristic analyses included the set of species planted. After ten years, richness of the community being restored is not far from the reference, but proportions of functional attributes differ between native and planted forest. More than 30 years are estimated to recover understory density. The dominance of immigrating species (74% of individuals and 85% of species) indicates that the regional species pool has a much stronger influence than the set of species planted to build a community assembly in the forest undergoing restoration.

T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine and analyze landscape ecology metrics to characterize the spatial pattern of fragments of native forest in S??o Mateus River basin, Esp??rito Santo State, Southeastern Brazil. Fragments were divided into four size classes called C1 ( 5 ha), C2 (5-25 ha), C3 (25.10-50 ha) and C4 ( 50 ha). Metrics were grouped according to their nature in (i) area and density, (ii) edge, (iii) shape, (iv) central area and (v) proximity. In total, 4,286 native forest fragments were identified, which represented 7.80% of total area of the basin. There is a predominance of fragments with more regular shapes, small (<25.10 ha) and, consequently, with greater edge effect. Results showed that the drainage basin studied is highly fragmented, which reinforces the need for strategies aimed at forest conservation and restoration of degraded forests in this region.

TI  - Tijuca National Park: Two pioneering restorationist initiatives in Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil
T2  - Brazilian Journal of Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - As a contribution to the environmental history of the Tijuca National Park, we report on two pioneering restorationist initiatives and list its the mammal species now found in this urban park. The Tijuca National Park (TNP), a 3,200 ha urban park covered by secondary tropical forest, is located within Rio de Janeiro, in southeastern Brazil. The two restorationist initiatives were a pioneer tropical forest restoration project in the nineteenth century and a fauna management project in the 70' s. The mammal list presented here was based on specimens in the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro and on publications. The mammal community of TNP is composed of 49 species, of which I I are on regional red lists, and four are on the 2003 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Occurrence of these threatened species and the park history itself made the TNP a priority site for studying conservation, management, and monitoring. Besides maintaining fauna and flora (including threatened species) diversity, the park benefits the population of Rio de Janeiro by providing water, green areas, and recreational and touristic opportunities.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Cedrela fissilis (Vell.): insights on conservation and production
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine selection criteria for the genetic conservation of, and growth improvement in Cedrela fissilis using a progeny test composed of 48 C. fissilis families planted with Pinus taeda in Rio Negrinho Municipality, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Genetic parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method, and early predictions of genetic gains were estimated using best linear unbiased predictions and a multi-effects index. Deviance analyses indicated that the families originated from a single population, and there were significant differences in survival, collar diameter and height among progeny. Stem bifurcation, number of sprouts per stump, damage caused by Hypsipyla grandella and frost damage did not differ. A seedling seed orchard was proposed to produce seeds for genetic conservation aimed at forest restoration in the Brazilian "Legal Reserve". It is estimated that these seeds will have a genetic gain of 2% for survival and a population size of 78 through the selection based on the progeny's additive values. In order to produce genetically improved seeds through a clonal seed orchard, a family selection based on independent elimination levels was proposed, using additive genetic values for survival and a multi-effect index within plots for collar diameter. In this case, 15 genotypes were selected, with a predicted gain of 4% in survival and 18% in collar diameter. The genetic variability found enables the use of the progeny test as an active germplasm bank, combining genetic conservation and sustainability of C. fissilis.

TI  - Sapling Survival and Growth in a Restoration Project of a Drained Wetland Forest in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the survival and growth of native tree saplings planted in a drained Mauritia flexuosa palm swamp (vereda) in southeastern Brazil, and to identify suitable species for restoration projects in these hygrophilous environments. Total sapling survival at one-year post-planting was 48%. The species with highest sapling survival and growth were Croton urucurana, Cecropia pachystachya, Erythroxylum citrifolium, Hirtella gracilipes and Tapirira guianensis. Lowest survival and growth were found in Mauritia flexuosa, Piper aduncum, Calophyllum brasiliense, Calyptranthes brasiliensis, Myrsine umbellata, Ladenbergia cujabensis and Ficus sp. We indicate the high-survival species for the restoration of these environments. Typical wetland species attained low survival and growth, indicating the negative influence of anthropization on this ecosystem's resilience, and highlighting the importance of studies investigating suitable strategies to restore them.

TI  - Exploring seed density and limiting similarity to reduce invasive grass performance for grassland restoration purposes
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions: Control of invasive species and seed addition are key steps in grassland restoration. Nevertheless, selecting seed mixes and seed quantities are hard tasks in restoration projects. An interesting idea is to design seed mixes using functional traits and create a community based on limiting similarity to overlap and outcompete the invader. We aimed to test the effect of two sown communities (one created to overlap the invader niche) and three seed sowing densities to reduce the performance of the invasive grass Eragrostis plana. Location: Greenhouse experiment in the Campos Sulinos grasslands region, Southern Brazil. Methods: We created a bifactorial experiment. The first factor was the sown community, each composed of nine native grasses but with different proportions: (1) Limiting, based on limiting similarity, and (2) Balanced, where all species were sown at the same seed weight. We used leaf functional traits (Specific leaf area, leaf area, leaf dry matter content ) to design the Limiting community. The second factor was the seed density of native species, sowing twice (1) 1 g/m(2), (2) 2 g/m(2), and (3) 4 g/m(2) (i.e., total density was 2, 4, and 8 g/m(2)). E. plana was sown once at 0.5 g/m(2). Above-ground and below-ground biomass of all species were collected after nine months to assess the treatment effects. Results: Biomass production of the invasive species was lower when sown with native species. Nevertheless, both sown communities did not differently affect the invasive biomass production. Higher seed density of native species resulted in lower invasive above-ground biomass, but not below-ground biomass. Three native species did not germinate, consequently, the established communities were quite different from those designed. Conclusions: The low species germination limited our discussion about the use of limiting similarity to design seed mixes. High seed sowing density is a better approach when defining sowing strategies to compete with invasive grasses.

TI  - Edge effects of linear canopy openings on understorey communities in a lowland Atlantic tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionDoes the creation of linear canopy openings in a lowland Atlantic tropical forest cause edge effects on understorey treelets, saplings and shrubs?LocationUniAo Biological Reserve, Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern Brazil (22 degrees 2530S, 42 degrees 0230W).MethodsWe sampled shrub, sapling and treelet communities at forest edges adjacent to two linear canopy openings (gas pipeline and power line) and in forest interiors far from any edge. Rarefaction curves were plotted to assess differences in species richness among treatments. Variation partitioning was used to assess main drivers of species composition and abundance. Partial Mantel correlations were calculated to verify edge effects controlling for effect of space on the abundance of Euterpe edulis palm and two ecological groups. For this purpose, species were classified either as disturbance-tolerant or disturbance-sensitive.ResultsEdge effects of linear canopy openings affect understorey species composition, but not species richness. Disturbance-tolerant species were more abundant in edges than in forest interiors, while disturbance-sensitive species did not show differences among treatments. However, the late-successional palm Euterpe edulis, which is abundant in forest interiors, was significantly less common at edges. Response to edge effects was stronger among treelets than shrubs and saplings.ConclusionsThe creation of infrastructure-related linear canopy openings caused edge effects that significantly affected understorey communities in the studied lowland Atlantic forest remnant. Such effects however were clearly distinct from those found at typical edges of tropical forest fragments.

TI  - Does tree planting change minds? Assessing the use of community participation in reforestation to address illegal logging in West Kalimantan
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gunung Pa lung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia has been persistently threatened by illegal logging for the past several decades. Subsequent fires have led to the encroachment of noxious grasses such as Imperata cylindrica, which have arrested succession to secondary forest within and around the park. Since 2009, local NGO Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) has reforested 20 hectares of degraded lmperata grassland within the park, with the goal of restoring forest area and decreasing the incidence of illegal logging inside the park by providing jobs and income to local people. In February 2013, a survey was conducted to assess the social impacts of the reforestation program, and to test the hypothesis that participation in reforestation can reduce instances of illegal logging through two pathways: (1) economic improvement for participants; (2) altering perceptions towards illegal logging. Structured interviews were conducted with 50 local residents, one-third of which identified as former illegal loggers, to gauge their perceptions towards forest conservation and illegal logging. The survey found that 80% of respondents believed that the reforestation program helped to reduce illegal logging in the park. However, the pathways through which this change occurred were different from those hypothesized. There was little evidence supporting the "perceptions change" pathway, but greater evidence supporting the "economic improvement" pathway through the medium of skill-building rather than direct economic improvement. Approximately 50% of participants reported engaging in self-directed tree planting activities post-involvement. These results suggest that forest restoration can effectively be used as a community-engagement tool to address illegal logging.

TI  - Losing our palms: The influence of landscape-scale deforestation on Arecaceae diversity in the Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity has gained pronounced importance to inform conservation planning. Palms are a characteristic, important component of forest structure and the functionality of tropical forests, yet fragmentation-related studies have been poorly investigated in deforested landscapes. Here, we examine the influence of forest loss at the landscape scale on the entire palm community by evaluating species turnover at nine 16 km(2) landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with 9-71% forest cover. Additionally, we examine the influence of canopy openness at the local scale. We identified all live palms at the species level within 50 x 100 m forest plots at each site and classified species into categories based on their habitat occurrence ("forest-interior" and "open-area" species). The number of Arecaceae species and stems greatly declined with lower amounts of forest cover at the landscape scale, with the power-law model best explaining these relationships. The community composition was also affected by forest cover, in which higher species dissimilarity was observed among severely deforested landscapes. Additionally, our results showed that palm assemblages have been shaped by non-random processes, with forest-interior species being negatively affected by reduced forest cover at the landscape scale. Landscapes embedded within less than 40% forest cover harbored fewer than 10 palm species, mainly consisting of open-area forest species. Our study therefore demonstrates the pervasive influence of habitat loss on palm diversity in severely deforested landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot. Extensive management actions, including forest restoration and the reintroduction of animal dispersers, are urgent and serve as important tools to permit the successful recruitment, reproduction and establishment of palm species in the unique Atlantic Forest biome.

TI  - Relationship of woody species composition with edaphic characteristics in threatened riparian Atlantic Forest remnants in the upper Rio Doce basin, Brazil
T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the composition, richness and diversity of plant species in tropical communities are essential for understanding relevant ecological processes and for developing appropriate conservation policies. Considering that areas subject to direct impacts due to dam breach may in the long-term present changes in species composition and in soil parameters, we evaluated the composition of the flora, described the current vegetation profile, and evaluated whether differences in species composition was influenced by soil variables of three areas along the Gualaxo River, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In addition, we identified important plant species through occurrence and phytosociological parameters for ecological restoration projects in the affected region, serving as reference areas. We sampled plant species with DBH >= 5 cm (diameter at breast height - measured 1.30 m above ground level) in 77 plots distributed in three riparian forest areas. We calculated phytosociological parameters and related them to edaphic factors. A total of 1579 individual plants belonging to 53 botanical families and 227 species were sampled in the three areas. The Fabaceae family was the most representative with 46 species. Species composition and diversity among the sampled areas was similar and was associated with edaphic factors. Furthermore, some species (e.g. Xylopia sericea, Cupania emarginata and Ocotea pulchalla) showed an important relation with soil variables. Some species of the genera (e.g. Byrsonima, Xylopia, Ocotea and Croton) and families (e.g. Fabaceae and Myrtaceae) found here, can be important species in the restauration process for the local and regional maintenance of floristic identity in the Rio Doce river.

TI  - The role of territorial governance as an instrument for biological diversity conservation in the Atlantic Forest: Social learning from the Parana <acute accent> River Biodiversity Corridor, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Latin America, in the non-coastal portion of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, there is the territory of Paran ' a River Biodiversity Corridor, which shares decision-making processes since 2010 and based on the performance of its Managing Network. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the Parana ' River Biodiversity Corridor Managing Network as an instrument of territorial governance for biological diversity conservation actions. Methodologically, the method of participant observation of the Network's meetings was used, in association with the semi-structured questionnaire and content analysis of its technical reports. The results showed that the Network expands institutional action for biodiversity conservation in the territory, enhancing personal learning and the possibility of building shared agendas, for example, the elaboration of a Bioregional Management Plan for the Corridor. Out of every 10 planned actions, seven were completed, which demonstrates confidence in the Network in mediating inter-institutional actions. One of these actions was the approval of an ecological restoration project carried out in partnership by 16 Network members from 2017 to 2022, expanding results and optimizing financial costs. However, there are limitations related to the institutional structure of the Network members, who lack dialogic and administrative prerogatives that end up not favoring territorial integration. Finally, develop actions for the conservation of biological diversity must be planned in a dialogical and participatory way, on a regional scale and mediated, unconditionally, by robust governance arrangements.

TI  - The Caratinga Alliance: community-based conservation efforts to increase forest for the muriquis and water for the farmers.
T2  - Neotropical Primates
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern muriqui is Critically Endangered. About 25% of the known population lives in the 1,200 ha of secondary forests of the Caratinga Biological Station (EBC) Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN-FMA) and neighboring farms. Long-term survival of the muriquis there depends on an increase in the availability of suitable habitat. Widespread deforestation has depleted soil fertility and dried up the streams in the region. Community-based conservation actions were carried out: 1) to protect and restore degraded areas to increase the availability of forests for the muriquis, and 2) to implement reforestation to improve the water balance vital for the regional recovery of rural production. Rural extension courses were provided for the local communities, which introduced modern production techniques to increase efficiency while decreasing environmental impacts. A new plant nursery was built and a pilot project to test forest restoration techniques was initiated.

TI  - Land degradation affects the microbial communities in the Brazilian Caatinga biome
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that global land degradation and desertification are increasing nowadays, understanding how soil microbial communities are modulated by these drivers is of paramount importance to mitigate these processes. Here, we assessed the effect of land degradation, restoration, and native forest on soil microbial communities in a semiarid region from Northeastern Brazil. Thus, soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm depth, in three sites: native, degraded, and restored lands. The soil DNA was extracted, and the microbial community was assessed by next-generation sequencing through the Illumina platform. The composition of microbial communities and their potential functions were altered by the degradation process, thereby decreasing microbial diversity. Also, the changes in the microbial communities seem to be related to soil chemical alterations, which were changed by the process of degradation and restoration. Land degradation led to a loss of diversity and functions, and the restored area presented more resilience, which suggests that the microbial communities could recover their functions by adopting sustainable practices. Importantly, degraded lands reduced functions related to chemoheterotrophic metabolism, which can strongly impact carbon dynamics in the system. Finally, this study provided relevant evidence that land restoration practices can recover soil functions, which is extremely relevant for further research that is aimed at the development of sustainable practices in degradation hotspots around the world.

TI  - Nutrient Allocation and Growth Responses of Senegalia polyphylla under Varied Fertilizer Regimes for Effective Forest Recovery
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To restore invaded areas, planting fast-growing native species such as Senegalia polyphylla (DC.) Britton & Rose (Fabaceae) is widely used. However, invasive grasses reduce light availability, alter fire regimes, and compete for water and nutrients, hindering the growth of native trees. Fertilization practices influence the competition dynamics between natives and invasives by altering soil fertility. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of mineral and organic fertilization on the nutritional status and growth of S. polyphylla cultivated during the first 120 days after transplanting. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design comprising five treatments and four replications, along with the unfertilized control (0-0%) as an additional treatment. Dystrophic red latosol and different proportions of mineral and organic fertilizers were used. The variables evaluated included dry mass of aboveground parts and roots, nutrient content in leaves, and nutrient use efficiency. The results showed that fertilizations with high nutrient concentrations (100-0% and 75-25%) resulted in greater accumulation of N, P, and K in the leaves, while balanced fertilization (50-50% and 25-75%) led to greater root dry mass. These results emphasize the importance of strategically choosing fertilizer formulations to promote the healthy development of seedlings in areas subject to interference from invasive grasses.

TI  - The role of ex situ seed banks in the conservation of plant diversity and in ecological restoration in Latin America
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Over half of the world's primary forest and a quarter of the world's plant species are found in Latin America. As a result of the limited protected areas and significant degradation of terrestrial ecosystems, seed banks provide an efficient component of integrated plant conservation strategies, chiefly due to their relatively low cost and massive storage capacity for genetic resources.Aims: We analyse the role that ex situ seed banks play in the conservation and reintroduction of threatened species, and in supporting ecological restoration programmes in the region.Methods: An analysis of the second National Reports on the state of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture showed that most countries in the region had the capacity for seed conservation. Using three case studies from seed conservation programmes in Mexico, Brazilian Amazonia and Chile, together with the global Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, we review the status and potential of these initiatives for conservation of plant diversity.Conclusion: The collection, conservation and use of seeds from arid and semi-arid biomes is highly effective; however the higher frequency of recalcitrant seeds in humid tropical forests requires a greater investment in research to underpin large-scale seed banking. In order to safeguard native species and provide adequate diversity of seeds for habitat restoration programmes, we anticipate the need to strengthen the capacity of the region's seed banks for preservation, research and propagation of native species.

TI  - Collembola as bioindicators of restoration in mined sand dunes of Northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast mining causes severe environmental impacts by removing the vegetation cover and depleting the fauna. Reforestation methods using native species and diverse pre- and post-disturbance approaches aim to recover the original richness and diversity of species found before the impact. Bioindicators are powerful tools to evaluate the restoration of the original environmental conditions in disturbed areas. We used species richness, endemism and diversity measurements of Collembola to compare successional stages in reforested sites of different ages compared with a control undisturbed area. Richness and abundance of Collembola were subjected to correlation analysis with age of plots and vegetational variables. Areas that were reforested for up to 16 years supported a much lower Collembola species richness than undisturbed areas. Both the age of reforestation plots and vegetation variables (number of trees, diameter of crowns, depth of leaf litter and tree species richness) were positively and significantly correlated to collembolan abundance and richness. The results showed that the diversity of the 16-year-old plot was significantly higher than that of younger areas, but significantly less diverse than that of the control area. Endemic species were more sensitive to disturbance than non-endemics. Thus, species richness and diversity of soil Collembola can be only partially restored with appropriate reforestation methods, and although it takes many years, to some extent even endemic species can be gradually restored. Nevertheless, the maintenance of undisturbed diversity reservoirs linked by ecological corridors to reforested plots is imperative, as only undisturbed areas can support most of the endemic species able to re-colonize reforested sites.

TI  - Success of active restoration in grasslands: a case study of birds in southern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands in southeastern South America have been extensively converted to various land uses such as agriculture, threatening regional biodiversity. Active restoration has been viewed as a management alternative for recovery of degraded areas worldwide, although most studies are conducted in forests and none has evaluated the effect of active restoration of grasslands in southeastern South America. From 2015 through 2017 we monitored a federally owned tract of grassland from the beginning of the active-restoration process. We compared the bird community in this active-restoration area (AR) with a reference area (NG) in Pampa grasslands in southern Brazil. We sampled birds by point counts and surveyed vegetation structure in plots. Over the 3 years of active restoration, bird species richness and abundance were higher in AR (30 species, 171 individuals) than NG (22 species, 154 individuals). The species composition also differed between the two habitats. Grassland bird species were present in both AR and NG. The vegetation structure differed between AR and NG in five attributes: height, short and tall grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Since it has been found that active restoration is useful in promoting species diversity, we encourage studies of the use of long-term restoration efforts. Our study, even on a local scale, showed a rapid recovery of the bird community in the active-restoration compared to native grassland, and suggests the potential for recovery of the degraded grasslands of the Brazilian Pampa biome.

TI  - Ecophysiological performance of a threatened shrub under restored and natural conditions in a harsh tropical mountaintop environment
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecophysiological responses of plants are useful for monitoring the success of ecological restoration projects that target species conservation. In this study we evaluated the ecophysiological traits of individuals of Chamaecrista semaphora from a natural population and from a site under restoration. Water potential and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were measured both in adult and young plants of the two populations. No difference in water potential was found between sites, but individuals in the restored site had higher water potential at predawn. Adults in the natural site presented lower daily values of potential quantum yield, indicating the occurrence of photoinhibition. Individuals in the restored site also presented higher maximum relative electron transport rate (ETRMAX). No difference was found in leaf carbon isotope discrimination values (delta C-13) between plants growing in restored and natural sites, suggesting similar water use efficiency. These results indicate that C. semaphora individuals in the restored site had similar or better photosynthetic and water economy performances than individuals at the natural site. Methodologies traditionally employed to assess stress response of plants, such as chlorophyll a fluorescence and procedures used to evaluate the efficiency of water use, allowed us to verify the success of restoration procedures using an endangered species.

TI  - Use of fuzzy systems in the elaboration of an anthropic pressure indicator to evaluate the remaining forest fragments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to develop a spatial analysis methodology with an inference fuzzy system using the geoprocessing techniques to generate an anthropic pressure indicator (API) based on two other indicators: Circularity Index (CI) and Edge Effects Index (EEI). This new methodology could indicate the remaining forest fragments exposition level after the anthropic action, considering the relationship between the geometry (CI) and the type of land use around the area (EEI) as the main factors. The studied area is located in the southwest part of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The obtained results show that rivers are often found as limits between fragments, demonstrating the importance of the preservation and conservation of riparian forest. In total, 846 forest fragments were identified, occupying 6.19 % of the study area, totalizing 2775.7 ha. Out of the total fragments 48.7 % were in medium and advanced successional stage of regeneration presenting elongated shapes and 16 % were in a high fragility interval, consequence of the edge effects. Moreover, the map of API showed that 16.2 % forest fragments were in a moderate high anthropic pressure interval, which deserve special attention for being very elongated, limited and pressured in an intense way by different types of land use which affect its surroundings. Thereby, the study demonstrated that the understanding of pressure types imposed on the remaining forest fragments through an indicator can contribute to management programs and territorial planning, giving conditions to the forest restoration in areas of strong anthropic pressure, and that the employment of fuzzy logics and geoprocessing could contribute significantly to diagnosis and trouble characterizations.

TI  - SEEDLING PRODUCTION OF NATIVE TREE SPECIES IN NURSERIES VIA RESCUE OF YOUNG PLANTS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty in obtaining young plants with high diversity in forest nurseries has caused the loss of biological and genetic diversity in the restoration projects of degraded areas. This study presents an alternative to minimize this problem by using the technical rescue of young plants, which were obtained from two forest patches with different stages of ecological succession ( average and initial), located in the municipal district of Carandai, MG. Individuals with up to 60 cm heights were transplanted to a nursery and evaluated for six months. A total of 966 individuals belonging to 26 families, totaling 70 different species, were rescued with a larger percentage of these being observed in the patches with more advanced stages of succession. The average surviva lrate was 79.3%, differing statistically among patches, individuals' height and species. Individuals from the initial patch stage, as well as those with an inferior height of 40 cm, were characterized by their highest survival level. A high level of plant survival could be verified, both pioneer and non-pioneer species, many of them not commonly found in forest nurseries and, consequently, also absent in the restoration projects. Therefore, the technical rescue of young plants is a viable complementary strategy, with low cost, which can contribute to the increasing of diversity in forest nurseries and in forest restoration projects.

TI  - Leaf-cutting ants alter seedling assemblages across second-growth stands of Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests promote an increased abundance of leaf-cutting ants (LCA) but the consequences on forest dynamics have been poorly addressed. Here we examine seedling assemblage attributes, seed germination and seedling survival across foraging zones of Atta cephalotes colonies inhabiting 15 second-growth patches (25-47 y old) of Atlantic forest. Seeds and seedlings were monitored within foraging zones and control sites over 1 y, including spots around ant nests. Overall, 1862 seedlings from 108 plant species were recorded. Seedling density decreased by 53% in foraging-zone plots (3.31 +/- 0.23 seedlings m(-2)) when compared with control plots (7.02 +/- 0.44 seedlings m(-2)) and a similar decrease was observed for species richness. Ant-induced alterations in the seedling assemblage were further indicated by segregation between foraging-zone and control plots (NMDS), habitat effects on species similarity (ANOSIM), and indicator tree species associated with control plots. While seed germination and seedling survivorship were uncorrelated to either nest distance or age of second-growth stands (with the exception of Tapirira guianensis), defoliation by LCAs was a significant cause of seedling mortality. Our results suggest that LCAs interfere with successional trajectories of Atlantic forest as foraging zones filter seedling establishment, supporting less-dense, impoverished and convergent seedling assemblages.

CP  - Workshop on Agroforestry Innovations for Imperata Grassland Rehabilitation
CL  - BANJARMASIN, INDONESIA
AB  - Fire is an important factor in the Imperata grassland ecosystem. It prevents or slows down the natural succession to shrubs and/or secondary forest vegetation and is a major threat to (agro)forestry options for Imperata grassland rehabilitation. Forest fires can also be a primary cause of the extension of Imperata grasslands. In this review an attempt is made to integrate biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of the causation of fires in a conceptual model. Fire effects on vegetation are examined. The management options at the level of a farmer, a village community and a national government are analyzed.

TI  - Cenostigma microphyllum seedlings in semiarid region grow faster under arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, regardless of water availability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation dry tropical forests (DTF) has several challenges that need to be overcome. In this perspective, this study evaluated the performance of Cenostigma microphyllum seedlings inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF plants) for 2 years after transplanting to the field with different rainfall intensity. AMF plants showed the highest gs values in both plots. These plants in wet plots stored more soluble sugars in their stems and roots, whereas root tissue was chosen under the dry plot. AMF plants had more phosphorus than Control plants in dry plots. Furthermore, AMF plants were 24% and 27% larger than Control plants in wet and dry plots, respectively. AMF plants root diameter was 25% and 18% greater in wet and dry plots, respectively, than in the control plants. Thus, the AMF plants showed higher main root biomass in both plots than the Control plants. The results of this study confirm that inoculation of C. microphyllum seedlings during germination confers a physiological advantage to these plants in field conditions after transplanting, regardless of water availability in the plot, even after two dry seasons. This can be a useful tool for recovering deforested areas in DTF.

TI  - Reduced ant diversity along a habitat regeneration gradient in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the response of the ant communities along a habitat regeneration gradient in the south Atlantic Forest comparing it with the ant fauna from a mature forest at the same biome. The survey was conducted according to standard collecting protocols, employing sardine baits and mini-Winkler apparatuses. The structure of the ground and litter-foraging ant community was compared in five habitats, representing a regeneration gradient within the Atlantic Forest. Furthermore, the composition of the leaf-litter ant fauna and the species richness were compared between the regeneration gradient and an area of mature forest. The results showed a higher number of leaf-litter ant species in the mature forest in comparison with the regeneration gradient habitat, as well a distinct species composition. There was a significant loss of ant diversity in the regrowth forest, compared to the mature Atlantic Forest. The composition of the ground-dwelling ant fauna does not consistently separate the sites of forest succession; but a gradient of ant species richness and composition was revealed when the leaf-litter ant fauna data set was included in the analysis. In this sense, the leaf-litter ant fauna is an important segment to characterize habitats also playing an important rule as bio-indicators. The data suggest that only primary forests (our data) and old secondary forests (in litt.) are capable of maintaining a substantial proportion of the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Property size drives differences in forest code compliance in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) dataset opens a new window for spatially explicit studies of the rural landscape of Brazil, enabling analysis with an accurate representation of land use and land cover change dynamics at the property level. Here, we evaluated farm compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (revised in 2012) in Mato Grosso do Sul state, where agribusiness activities have already converted more than 70% of native vegetation, Cerrado. We analysed the most recent version of the CAR dataset, using geographic information system analytical tools. We observed a positive relationship between compliance with the 20% compulsory Legal Reserves and farm size class. We showed that larger, rather than smaller, farms have important effects on biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale. Large farms (> than 1000 ha), comprising 74.2% of the study area, tended to show better compliance levels (51%) than smaller properties (33%). At the same time, they contain huge amount of land with native vegetation that lies outside Legal Reserves, and so may pose a risk for legal deforestation of near 2 million ha. We argue that a portfolio of socioeconomic incentives for restoration, protected areas, and no-net-loss components in agricultural programmes, are essential measures to increase compliance and halt deforestation in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. Moreover, we argue that considering property size improves the likelihood of success of such initiatives. Although acknowledging that landscape management can help address socioeconomic conflicts and improve food production, it must be accompanied by a strong "anti-deforestation" policy to guarantee the maintenance of existing native vegetation remnants. We also highlight the importance of investigating the role of property size in maintaining remaining vegetation in this region, instead of merely focused on the number of compliant farms.

TI  - Effects of environmental protection policies on fragile areas of a watershed occupied by agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has become an antagonist in natural resource conservation policies in recent years. The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the biomes most affected by this setback due to the occupation of areas of economic interest in agriculture. Interestingly, there are projects throughout the biome that aim to encourage the preservation of natural resources, but there is uncertainty about whether these incentives have provided conservation. That is the case of the Feio River hydrographic basin, located in the Cerrado, near the city of Patrocinio, state of Minas Gerais. Indeed, the Feio River watershed has projects incentivizing the Cerrado's conservation. Thus, in this article, we aimed to explain how the advance of agriculture in fragile areas of the Feio river watershed occurs, their causes and whether protection strategies have produced satisfactory results. We used an old Environmental Fragility proposal methodwith our contributions to estimate the variations regarding nature conservation in the basin. Our findings show considerable heterogeneity in the potential fragility of the Feio's river basin. We observe that less fragile sites are used for coffee cultivation (74 and 72% of the two places), while more fragile sites are occupied by reserves (around 50% of the area) and high-impact activities such as traditional monoculture and cattle ranching (25 and 44% for the two sites). Temporally, we observed little change in use and occupation, with a slight increase in no-till farming to replace coffee and conventional cultivation. The permanent preservation areas in the basin have improved vegetation quality, while the reserve areas composed of fields show a degradation process. Considering the importance of the Feio's river basin, different incentives and inspection strategies are needed to guarantee the site's preservation and environmental restoration.

TI  - Nucleario, cardboard, or manual crowning: which maintenance technique is most cost-effective in tree seedling survival establishment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In ecological restoration, one of the main challenges is to develop new methods, techniques, and incentives that both favour and reduce maintenance costs in restoration projects. Besides, post-planting maintenance is often neglected hampering seedling survival over time owing to alien grasses, which compete strongly with native plants for resources. To solve these issues, recently, an innovative technology called Nucleario has been developed in Brazil. Aiming to hinder alien competition filters, the Nucleario also attempts to condition a better microenvironment, reducing drought stress through the water storage tank, decreasing temperatures, which facilitates the survival and growth of seedlings in areas under restoration. Another method used to decrease alien grasses, which is inexpensive, is seedling crowning using cardboard lowing maintenance needs in restored areas. Cardboard has similar functions to Nuclear-la, such as protecting soil against loss of water and nutrients and reducing competition with invasive exotic grasses. Therefore, comparing them also with traditional manual weeding (i.e., clean-weeded crown by hoe), we aimed to verify which technique is most cost-efficient for seedling crown maintenance of Dipteryx alata Vog., which is an indigenous tree species with high economic value owing to its nuts. We tested three techniques in areas under restoration in the Cerrado, in the Environmental Protection Area "Corrego Guariroba" located in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We monitored seedlings submitted to the three methods in the wet and the dry periods for biotic (competition with exotic grasses, herbivory, and growth) and abiotic (moisture and soil temperature) indicators. We observed that the Nuclear-la was the treatment that maintained the highest soil moisture, resulting in a larger canopy area. However, these effects do not reflect increases in the survival rate, diameter, and height of the seedlings. None of the treatments was effective in reducing herbivory. Nuclear-la was the most effective treatment in reducing the competition of seedlings with invasive grasses. Cardboard presented an implementation value 21.5 times lower than Nuclear-la and 1.2 times than manual crowning. Given the high purchase price, the Nucleario's cost-benefit ratio was very high compared to the crowning of cardboard and the manual weeding, which discourages us from recommending it for this species with high survival rates. Its project can be revised to decrease herbivory rates, as well as its efficiency tested in the short and long term in different ecosystems and species, particularly species susceptible to water stress.

TI  - TEMPORAL SEGREGATION BETWEEN TWO ARMADILLO SPECIES IN THE SOUTHERN PANTANAL OF BRAZIL
T2  - Mastozoologia Neotropical
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal of Brazil is the largest tropical wetland in the world and home to a high diversity of armadillos, with up to six sympatric species in any one location. Among these species are the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus), both highly specialized diggers. We investigated how these two armadillos partitioned resources and coexisted by exploring multiple aspects of their ecology, including diel activity through camera trapping, and substrate and microhabitat preference through burrow sampling in forest and grassland habitats. Ultimately, we found no significant differences between the substrate particle sizes in two habitats (forest and grassland). However, because we could not confirm the relationship between burrows and species, the data obtained in the field were not sufficient to determine these correlations. We found a significant difference in activity patterns between the species, with nine-banded armadillos exhibiting greater nocturnal activity and six-banded armadillos exhibiting more diurnal activity. The species overlapped minimally overall in their activity patterns, with the highest amount of overlap occurring at dusk. Our study suggests temporal segregation occurs between these two armadillos and may serve as an ecological strategy to reduce competitive interactions between them. Future studies would benefit from assessing alternative niche axes between or among two or more armadillo species in other ecoregions.

TI  - Restoration of the Brazilian savanna after pine silviculture: Pine clearcutting is effective but not enough
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting tree monocultures in Brazilian savannas is a common practice for wood production. However, afforestation and fire suppression have caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting). To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired restoration target), and a cerradao (the local alternative state when savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm) and ground layer (woody species with height >= 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm, and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities appearing similar to cerradao. Generalist species dominated all layers, and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7% to 83.0%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28%). Pine clearcutting, independent of whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees.

TI  - Forest species in ecological restoration of Cerrado vegetation
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of ecosystems in the Cerrado biome is challenging, and it is aggravated when colonization by invasive species occurs or when there was a degradation by mineral exploration. This study aimed to evaluate whether individuals from three fast-growing forest species - Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub., Lithraea molleoides (Veil.) Engl. and Terminalia argentea Mart. - had a fulfilling role of containing colonization by exotic species and the facilitating regeneration of woody species below tree canopies. Ten plots of 20 m x 20 m were installed, measuring all individuals which had diameters at a height of 30 cm from the ground (DHG)> 5 cm, total height (TH), and canopy diameters (COPA). From the sampling of planted seedlings, three prominent species in DHG, TH and COPA and being abundant growing species in the study area were investigated as potential facilitators regarding abiotic characteristics (gravimetric humidity, luminosity, and resistance to penetration), which were measured in the areas under them. The studied species had a height increase considered high. In the case of the luminosity Peltophorum dubium presented greater canopy coverage than did Lithraea molleoides. For gravimetric moisture of the soil, Lithraea molleoides and Terminalia argentea presented the highest averages. Peltophorum dubium presented less soil penetration resistance at the depth of 20-40 cm and a greater number of regenerates in its direct influence area when compared to the other species. Overall, despite not having observed an increase in the number and richness of regeneration below the canopies, it is important that studies investigating the facilitation as a mechanism that promotes the agility to the restoration process in the Cerrado continue to be performed

TI  - Limited effectiveness of artificial bird perches for the establishment of seedlings and the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Atlantic Forest biome is severely degraded and fragmented throughout its range. Developing effective techniques to restore pasture and agriculture back to native vegetation is therefore a priority for legal and conservation purposes. In this study, we evaluate the ability of artificial bird perches to enhance the arrival of new seeds and seedling establishment in a degraded, semi-deciduous seasonal portion of the Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Specifically, we assess the influence of previous land use and habitat types on the abundance, species richness and ecological traits of bird-dispersed seeds, as well as on seedling establishment. Eight sampling sites were established, each containing one unit with seed traps and restoration plots under artificial perches and one similar unit without the perches. These sites were located in pasture and agriculture, distributed between riparian and sub-montane areas. Monthly sampling was conducted over two years between December 2005 and November 2007, resulting in the evaluation of 25,755 seeds and 56 endozoochoric seed species. The most abundant species were the pioneers Cecropia pachystachya Trecul and Solanum americanum Mill. Experimental units with perches received significantly more seeds than control units. Moreover, seed arrival was higher in sub-montane areas and on former pasture sites. Species richness followed a similar pattern of higher seed arrival, but there was no effect of vegetation type. Ecological characteristics of seeds were associated with land use type: former pastures received more tree seeds and pioneer species than expected by chance. Seedling establishment was very low in all treatments, with only eight seedlings established in perch plots by the end of the experiment. We conclude that despite artificial perches significantly increasing the arrival of endozoochoric seeds onto degraded lands, seedling establishment is drastically limited in these areas, compromising the efficacy of this technique for restoration purposes.

TI  - Planning for the Restoration of Functional Connectivity in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimLand use and land cover (LULC) change is the main driver of biodiversity loss, causing habitat loss and fragmentation that hinders species movement and negatively impacts populations. While habitat fragments are structurally disconnected, functional connectivity can still occur depending on the species' dispersal abilities. Incorporating landscape connectivity into restoration planning helps identify strategic areas significantly enhancing connectivity. Here, we present an unprecedented, nationwide continuous spatial layer representing each restorable pixel's contribution to functional connectivity, using Brazil as a case study.LocationBrazil.MethodsWe performed a dynamic pixel-based analysis across each Brazilian biome to assess the potential increases in the Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC) resulting from restoring each restorable pixel in the landscape. For that, we defined hypothetical species with medium, high and very high dispersal abilities and calculated the IIC for the different natural LULC in each biome. Then, we ran a dynamic pixel-based restoration analysis to assess the contribution of each restorable pixel to functional connectivity.ResultsOur resulting dataset represents the relative contribution of connectivity for each restorable pixel in the landscape, considering all dispersal abilities and LULC in each biome. Since we are assessing the contributions of individual pixels to overall biome landscape connectivity, most values are expectedly low. However, pixels with the highest contributions to connectivity show a stand-alone contribution biome-wide and thus were interpreted as priorities for restoration. Notably, we show nested regions as priorities for restoration, with a trend of higher priority rankings (e.g., the top 5% most important regions) being surrounded by subsequent rankings of priorities.Main ConclusionsOur study is the first to evaluate the impact of restoration planning efforts on functional connectivity across all Brazilian biomes. We identified priority areas for restoration within each Brazilian biome, providing valuable information to guide decision-making and policy implementation. The innovative pixel-based analysis used in the study can be replicated in other regions, aiming to make restoration planning more efficient.

TI  - Restoration of a coastal swamp forest in southeast Brazil
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of degraded swamps often requires strong human intervention because of their fragility. In Brazil, coastal swamp forests are now much reduced by anthropogenic action. This paper investigates survival and growth performance of nine native shrub and tree species introduced into a degraded swamp invaded by exotic grasses and sedges in coastal Rio de Janeiro. Our central aim was to evaluate which species were more appropriate for use in initial stages of revegetation. Additionally, in separate field experiments, we tested statistical hypotheses that higher survival and growth performance would be found for seedlings: (a) taller in height, (b) subjected to shorter duration of flooding, and (c) planted with addition of organic matter inside the planting holes. Results were analyzed after 3 years of planting. "Planting in mounds", and a consequent reduction on the flooding period plants are exposed to, increased survival and growth. The use of taller seedlings often increased survival, and organic matter addition increased growth. Three (Myrsine rubra, Tabebuia cassinoides, and Calyptranthes brasiliensis) out of nine species tested showed high growth- and use-viability indices, and were therefore indicated for use in revegetation programs. Interspecific variation as regards responses to the treatments applied suggests that in the future, species evaluated for this purpose, should be examined on a case-by-case basis.

T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at increasing knowledge about the challenges, opportunities and contexts of municipal environmental management in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Through an online questionnaire sent to contacts from 760 municipal environmental agencies, 88 valid answers were obtained. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Among the results achieved, the following stand out: (i) the challenges and opportunities related to the management of urban solid waste are central and feedback negatively due the lack of personnel, resources and projects; (ii) there is a favorable scenario for ecological restoration and circular economy in the municipalities that is not carried out as a consequence of low institutional capacity; (iii) municipal conservation units (CUs) were more frequent than federal and state ones, which is positive; however, it alerts to the underreporting of municipal CUs in the national registry and to the need for research and efforts that integrate municipalities into the context of specially protected territories; (iv) 68% of the sampled municipalities received the 'ICMS Ecologico' tax benefit, which must be related to the observed frequency of municipal CUs; (v) 60% of the municipalities have some type of environmental regulation of their own regardless of the population size and environmental licensing for projects with a local impact; (vi) intersectionality is practiced between the municipal and state environmental bodies, which may be related to standard procedures, such as the Ecological Tax (ICMS); (vii) the municipal environmental councils were appointed as the main management instrument, referring to the importance of democracy for environmental management; (viii) one third of the sampled managers do not fully understand the context of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals); and (ix) partnerships between municipal environmental management agencies and universities that are located in the territories has a potential to be promoted. It is recommended that research, innovation and entrepreneurship institutions pay attention to the socioenvironmental opportunities present in inland municipalities.

TI  - REHABILITATION OF A DEGRADED AREA IN THE FIELD OF SEMIDECIDUOUS SEASONAL FOREST UNDER DIFFERENT TREATMENTS
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It was aimed to evaluate three treatments for forest restoration in an area with periodic elevation of the groundwater, in the Corredor de Biodiversidade Santa Maria, located between the cities of Santa Teresinha de Itaipu and Sao Miguel do Iguacu, in Parana state. The treatments were: control, green manure and soil solarization. It was performed a monthly monitoring of mortality and development of 12 tree native species of the region and the persistence of two invasive species present in the area, Megathyrsus maximus (coloniao grass) and Cyperus rotundus (coco grass). Furthermore, it was evaluated the changes introduced in the soil by three soil samples during the experiment. After over a year of assessment, the treatments showed no statistically significant differences on the evaluations. The mortality was more pronounced in January (12.08%), with a higher percentage for Cabralea canjerana (canjarana) and lower for Luehea divaricata (acoita-cavalo). About the seedlings development, growth was higher for: Sapium glandulatum (leiteiro-do-banhado), Croton urucurana (sangra-d'-agua) and Luehea divaricata, with monthly increases in diameter of 3.66 mm to 4.12 mm, and height of 12.39 cm to 17.02 cm. Regarding the dry mass of 'coloniao' grass and coco grass (nutsedge) in all treatments, the highest values were found in January (94.14 g m(-2)) and February (132.76 g m(-2)), remaining low throughout the experiment. Through soil analyzes, it was observed that treatments showed no significant differences, however, the physical and chemical changes in the soil were sensitive to the invasive species management, which may lead to new modifications during the growth of seedlings.

TI  - Restoration of subtropical grasslands degraded by non-native pine plantations: effects of litter removal and hay transfer
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pinus plantations create strong ecological legacies that persist after their removal. We evaluated the effectiveness of pine litter removal (manually or through controlled burns) and hay application for the restoration of South Brazilian coastal grasslands degraded by pine plantations. We installed the experiment 1 year after cutting trees and sampled the vegetation 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after initiating the experiment. We used generalized linear mixed model to assess treatment effects on plant cover, richness, and pine reestablishment. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling and indicator species analysis to evaluate changes in species composition over time and in the association of individual species with treatments and reference area. Species richness and vegetation cover did not differ between manual and burn treatments but were higher than in the control. Hay application enhanced vegetation cover by the end of the experiment in all treatments. Hay application enhanced richness initially, but after 2 years the effect persisted only in the burn treatment. Burned plots showed less pine establishment than plots with manual litter removal. Hay-addition plots contained indicator species present in the reference area. Our results suggest that passive restoration (i.e. only cutting of pine) is not sufficient to restore grasslands altered by afforestation, as residual pine litter constrains the reestablishment of native vegetation. In addition to the benefits of litter removal, our results indicate that hay transfer can overcome seed limitation of grassland species and burning can reduce recolonization by pine.

AB  - The knowledge on forest patches in rural properties allows. the application of a correct environmental administration, promoting their conservation and restoration in degraded areas. By using the softwares SPRING and FRAGSTATS, the landscape was characterized with emphasis on the patches of secondary Seasonal Semidecidual Forest, located in the municipal district of Carandai, MG, and the area around it, considering its evolution from the period of 1984 to 2007. It could be concluded that progressive increase in the total area of native forest occurred due to the appearance of new patches, and the individual area of each patch presented reduction tendency, what provided increase of the edge area, reducing the percentage of each patch which is the core area during the gap of the evaluated time. Despite the advantage of predominance of patches in simple geometric ways, with reduction of the edge effect, the quality of the landscape got threatened because it was predominantly constituted by small patches. The forest patches were still so distant one from the others (More than 200 meters), presenting small gathering tendency (result of the increase of the number of patches), however; still insufficient. Therefore, although the covering of native forest has presented increase of total area, in general, it lost in quality in the gap of the time considered.

TI  - USE OF GEOBIA APPROACH FOR ANALYSING THE LAND USE AND VEGETATION COVER DYNAMICS IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF BROTAS-SP, BRAZIL
T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance and fragility of natural resources, the concern with the disorderly human intervention on the environment has become recurrent, and different approaches for space occupation are being implemented. However, perception and detection of spatial changes are often empirical due to the lack of information. Thus, the best possible information regarding land use and vegetation cover is needed to improve understanding such changes in the Earth's surface and their dynamism. The present work aimed at analysing the anthropogenic changes on land use and vegetation cover between 2001 and 2016 in the municipality of Brotas-SP (Brazil), where there is a recent focus on ecotourism and the conservation of natural resources, especially for evaluating the effectiveness of public policies for municipal development based on sustainable bases. The GEOBIA object-oriented image classification approach was applied to Landsat 7/ETM+ and Landsat 8/OLI images. Land use and vegetation cover maps showed the conversion of pasture areas to agriculture and natural areas, as a function of ecotourism, however, in a fragmented way. The overall accuracy and Kappa index of the classified maps was 90 % and 0.89, respectively, proving the efficiency of this approach in environmental studies.

TI  - Epipelon biomass responses to different restoration techniques in a eutrophic environment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is a worldwide problem. In eutrophic lakes, phosphorus release from stored sediment hinders restoration processes. The epipelon is a community that grows attached to the sediment surface and has the potential to help phosphorus retention by autotrophic organisms. This study evaluated epipelon responses to four lake restoration techniques. The responses of abiotic variables and phytoplankton biomass were also evaluated. Four simultaneous mesocosm experiments were performed in a shallow eutrophic lake. The applied techniques were aeration, flocculant, floating macrophytes, and periphyton bioreactor. Water and epipelon samples were taken on days 3, 10, 17, 27, and 60. The aeration treatment and macrophytes decreased light availability in the epipelon, which had a predominance of heterotrophic components. Flocculant and periphyton bioreactor treatments favored epipelon growth with a higher contribution of autotrophic components. Therefore, some techniques may favor the epipelon growth, while others may harm the community, resulting in less efficient restoration processes. For the complete restoration of a lacustrine ecosystem, the choice of techniques to be applied must consider the restoration and maintenance of the benthic environment.

TI  - Climate change threatens amphibians and species representation within protected areas in tropical wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are crucial for biodiversity conservation, yet climate change threatens their long-term effectiveness by displacing species distributions. Among the most climate-threatened organisms are the amphibians, highly dependent on water and wetlands. The world's largest continuous tropical wetland, the Pantanal and surroundings, is situated in the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) in South America. Of the 74 amphibian species found there, 4% are threatened. Less than 5% of the basin is within PAs. Recurrent droughts and increasing human pressures further endanger the region's semiaquatic fauna if adequate protection measures are not implemented. Using Ensemble of Small Models, we mapped habitat suitability of amphibian species and projected amphibian richness and composition across the UPRB. We applied null models to evaluate the representation of amphibian ranges within the current PA network under both current and future climate scenarios. To prioritize areas for PA network expansion under climate change scenarios, we used a systematic conservation planning algorithm. By 2100, over 80% of amphibian species from the study area are projected to lose suitable habitat, with 99% of amphibian assemblages facing climate-driven species loss. Although the existing PA network had limited species representation, protecting on average less than 5% of amphibian ranges. However, 13.7% of PAs are expected to shelter more amphibian species than expected by chance under future climate conditions. Highlands, particularly in the northern and southeastern boundaries of the UPRB, are identified priority areas for PA network expansion due to their high projected changes in amphibian biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal the extensive impacts of climate change on a major semiaquatic group in the world's largest tropical wetland. Although the current PA network in the Pantanal and surroundings safeguards fewer amphibians than expected, its limited coverage provides opportunities for systematic, data-driven expansion to achieve the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework's 30 by 30 target. Expanding PAs is urgent, but addressing drivers of environmental degradation, including unsustainable practices in agriculture and livestock farming, is equally critical for conserving this biodiverse ecosystem.As Unidades de Conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o (UCs) s & atilde;o cruciais para a conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o da biodiversidade, mas as altera & ccedil;& otilde;es clim & aacute;ticas amea & ccedil;am a sua efic & aacute;cia a longo prazo ao deslocar a distribui & ccedil;& atilde;o das esp & eacute;cies.

TI  - Planning and implementing ecological corridors in the southeast Atlantic Forest: Challenges and opportunities
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing ecological corridors studies are much more common than studies that evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of implementation. Thus, this study aimed to identify and discuss factors that can influence the implementation of ecological corridors designed from a multicriteria analysis. For this purpose, the ecological corridor implementation efforts of a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in an Atlantic Forest region were evaluated. The following information about the restoration projects was collected from the NGO database: georeferenced restoration polygons, restoration technique, project size, motivation, and land use tenure characteristics of the restoration site. Restoration polygons were spatially referenced to the planned corridor areas and classified according to land use and land cover, slope, distance to roads and occurrence in Permanent Preservation Areas. The NGO implemented 455.0 hectares of restoration, with only 10.7% within proposed corridors. NGO projects were concentrated on ecological restoration, which presents significant differences between ecological corridors. In practice, the implementation of restoration areas was primarily guided by the local characteristics of the landscape, project's constraints and the will and interest of rural landowners in restoring their properties. This differs from its planning, in which social and economic aspects were not considered and only the environmental variables were taken into.

TI  - Prospecting the potential of ecosystem restoration: A proposed framework and a case study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multiscaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium-and local-scaleto assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered "non-habitat", i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.

TI  - Assessing species composition and structural attributes across different habitats to evaluate changes and management effectiveness of protected mangroves
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and restoration of mangroves are necessary to meet global commitments for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises as well as reducing poverty. Management success is typically evaluated by estimating changes in vegetation cover, while changes in species composition and structural attributes across different habitats are often not considered. Here, we evaluated changes in mangrove composition, structural attributes, and drivers of change across Physically Stable Habitat (PSH), Diminished Tidal Inundation Habitat (DTIH), and Poor Drainage Habitat (PDH), for mangroves that have been protected for 22 years. We also analyzed the most likely ecological processes involved in the changes that have occurred. After 22 years, species remained the same in PSH and DTIH, but Rhizophora apiculata and Lumnitzera racemosa disappeared in PDH. Changes in relative proportions (number of trees of a species: total number of trees), and species abundance, varied between habitats. Additionally, changes in structural attributes also differed between habitat types over time suggesting they were driven by distinct ecological processes. Vegetation changes in PSH most likely occurred through a combination of ecologically important mangrove forest replacement and gap recovery processes, compared to only the gap recovery process in DTIH, and episodic changes due to stressful environmental conditions in PDH. Restoring hydrology, preventing sedimentation, planting proper seedlings of Avicennia marina should be conducted to save species and mangrove sustainability in PDH. It is highly recommended that managers follow a habitat-based approach to achieve effective management.

TI  - Predicting restored communities based on reference ecosystems using a trait-based approach
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration should focus, not only on species composition, but also on the ecological functions provided by the ecosystem, mirroring the characteristics found in the reference site. In this context, plant functional traits could help to achieve this goal, as they directly affect ecosystem processes. Thus, modeling species composition based on species functional traits could provide ways to make predictions about future communities and to assess the functioning of the ecosystem. In order to evaluate how different restored communities are from their reference ecosystem, we used a trait-based modeling approach that predicts relative abundances of a community based on the functional composition of the reference ecosystem. We surveyed adult trees in the canopy and seedlings in the understory in both reference and 10 year-old restoration sites in two different locations in South of Brazil to gather information of species composition and their relative abundances. Functional composition was based on information of leaf traits for all species included in the survey. We applied the model on two different components: canopy and understory species. We found differences in functional composition between the restored communities and the reference sites, indicating that the ten-year old restored forests are still not similar to the reference ecosystem. Both the observed and the predicted understory communities were more similar to the reference ecosystem than the observed canopy communities. It indicates that species that established after restoration interventions have functional composition closer to the reference ecosystem than the set of species initially selected for planting. Modeling the community based on functional trait composition coupled with long-term monitoring of sites undergoing restoration would enable a better evaluation of restoration trajectories and management needs to modify ecosystem functions towards values found in reference sites. Restoration should focus on the recovery of functional composition, which would provide a better set of resources for organisms and promote changes in ecosystem processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Survival and early growth of 51 tropical tree species in areas degraded by artisanal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal gold mining in Amazon forests and rivers has been reported in all Amazonian countries. Amazon mining has a wide range of negative effects and severe environmental and social consequences. Given that the activity in the region is mostly illegal, there are few studies published in the scientific literature on recovery of areas degraded by gold mining. This study conducts an experimental reforestation project aimed to evaluate soil degradation and explore the seedling survivorship and early growth of 51 tropical tree species in gold mined areas at 5 study sites distributed across the Madre de Dios region, in the Peruvian Amazon. The study evaluates the effect of biochar amendments on the survivorship and growth of 51 tropical species. The study also analyzes the influence of species wood density on seedling performance one year after planting. In order to inform further restoration plantation strategies, species were chosen with the end goals of timber production, biodiversity enhancement, and soil restoration. Site degradation, soil properties and mercury levels were analyzed in degraded areas and paired reference forest patches. Soils after gold mining are found to be highly degraded, with soil C being nearly absent, cation content greatly decreased, and loss of fine sediment. Soil mercury levels were found below national and international environmental quality standards. A positive correlation and a statistically significant relationship were found between survivorship and wood density. This reveals that the higher the wood density of the species, the higher the survival percentage. Growth and overall performance of mid, and especially low wood density species were significantly increased by biochar additions, while no effect was recorded on high wood density species growth. The study provides guidance on the post-ASGM restoration potential for 51 common and useful tree species and gives practitioners recommendations for combinations of species and fertilization treatments to optimize restoration designs.

TI  - POTENTIAL SPECIES FOR RECOVERY AREAS SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST IN IRON EXPLORATION IN THE SERRA ESPINHACO
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the tree flora in a fragment of semi deciduous forest in the region of the Espinhaco, with aim to propose species for restoration of areas degraded by mining exploitation of iron in similar ecosystems. The inventory floristic and structural of vegetation of shrubs and trees was conducted in September 2007, by the quadrants-point method according to the method of minimum distances, whose inclusion criterion of the stem above the height 1.3 m. The individual were stratified into adults (DBH >= 5.0 cm) and juvenile (DBH < 5.0 cm). We sampled 90 points, which were identified 94 species, 70 genera and 32 families. For the diversity index of Shannon, values presented for each layer were 3.96 nats.ind(-1) and 3.94 nats.ind(-1), and equability of Pielou were 0.896 and 0.938, respectively for layer juvenile and adult. Families that stood out by the number of species were Myrtaceae (17), Fabaceae (12), Rubiaceae (8), Euphrobiaceae (6), Sapindaceae (5) and Lauraceae (5). For the recovery area were selected seven groups of species that will be used for recuperation of degraded areas. The characteristics of the species were sufficient for the definition of functional groups that can be used in recuperation of degraded areas.

TI  - GENETIC DIVERSITY OF Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong. IN THE LOW SAN FRANCISCO RIVER BY RAPD MARKERS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Enterolobium contortisiliquum Vell. Morong (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae) is very much used in riparian forest restoration programs in the Low San Francisco River because of its fast initial growth. The objective of this work was to evaluate by RAPD molecular markers the genetic diversity of eight individuals of a remaining population of this species, in order to contribute for the definition of strategies for seed production. The individuals are situated in an area of 100ha in the riparian forest of the Low San Francisco River. DNA extraction was carried out with young and tender leaves using 2% CTAB. Twenty primers of ten arbitrary sequence bases were used. The products were separated in 0.8% agarose horizontal gel electrophoresis, stained with Ethidium Bromide and visualized with ultraviolet light. The genetic similarity among the individuals was calculated by Jaccard Similarity Coefficient and dendrograms were obtained using the UPGMA method. The mean value for genetic diversity among individuals was 49%, varying from 33% to 85%. Individuals 6 and 7 showed a high genetic similarity (67%). Therefore, their planting or direct seeding to restore riparian areas is not indicated in places near to each other. The results showed that strategies for seed collection and seedling production can be developed to assist in restoration programs.

TI  - Occupancy of different types of forest habitats by tyrant flycatchers (Passeriformes: Tyrannidae)
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance distribution of the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae family) was evaluated in three main forest habitats of Mata dos Godoy State Park (PEMG), north of the state of Parana. We conducted point counts and from the collected data we calculated the Index of Point Abundance (I. P. A.) of each species in the habitats of interior of mature forest (FLI), slope forest (FLE) and reforestation (REF). Among the 22 recorded species, eight occurred in all habitats, while other eight occurred in two habitats and six were exclusive of one habitat. Among the 16 recorded species in more than one habitat, 10 were more abundant in only one. On the contrary to our expectation and despite the clear habitat segregation among species, the abundance distribution was not significantly influenced by the foraging strategies. Maybe, phylogenetic relationships could better explain the found pattern. Some partially frugivorous species were present in REF and FLI. Those species could be considered as potential ecological restoration agents and thus to promote seed dispersal among habitats. Indeed, the greater similarity of tyrant flycatchers abundance distribution in FLI and REF indicates that these two habitats could be part of the same gradient. FLE, however, can be considered a separated habitat by its abundance of bamboo clusters and the six tyrant flycatcher species which are commonly associated with this vegetation type.

TI  - Changes in fine-scale spatial genetic structure related to protection status in Atlantic Rain Forest fragment
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) is an extremely reduced and fragmented biome that provides essential ecological services to millions of people. Despite the presence of protected areas, the vast majority of AF remnants are small and isolated and suffer from anthropogenic disturbances. In this scenario, we expected changes in the spatial genetic structure and gene flow, with increased inbreeding and higher extinction risks for the remnant biota. Due to its ecological importance, utility and overexploitation in a wide range of the AF, Melanoxylon brauna Schott (Fabaceae) was used as a model to study the influence of conservation unities and the amount of habitat on its genetic parameters. We aimed to investigate both the spatial and genetic population patterns throughout the range of this species. We also evaluated the effects of the protection status of forest remnants and forest cover at the landscape scale on the population parameters. We found that the remaining populations of M. brauna suffered a severe reduction, and that adult trees are now rare. We also detected, for the first time, selfing in some populations, as well as changes in the effective number (N-e) and in the spatial genetic structure (Sp statistics) related to the protection status and forest cover. Based on these findings we proposed some recommendations based on restoration projects to recover the conservation status of the species and the remaining fragments of the AF.

TI  - Soil properties under different supplementary organic fertilizers in a restoration site after kaolin mining in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining is one of the economic activities that most degrade ecosystems, and the rehabilitation of such environments in the Brazilian Amazon is still a challenge. The first step is to recover the soil quality for plant reestablishment. In this study was evaluated the effect of different organic fertilizers, supplementary to chemical fertilizers, on the physical and chemical attributes of a minesoil after kaolin mining in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Nine trenches measuring 1 m x 40 m and 1 m in depth were opened in a reconstructed area after kaolin mining. They were 6 m apart from each other and filled with topsoil from areas destined for new mine pits. Then 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm pits were opened along the trenches. They were 1.5 m apart from each other within each trench, and 400 g pit-1 of simple superphosphate, 130 g pit-1 of urea and 130 g pit-1 of potassium chloride were applied in five treatments: three treatments along the trenches, in the planting rows with; i) addition of topsoil; ii) sawdust; iii) cattle manure, and two treatments between the planting rows; iv) sawdust; and v) without sawdust. Two hundred and fifty seedlings of six heliophilous tree species were planted, being randomly distributed. One hundred and forty-four disturbed (original structure altered) and 144 undisturbed (structure equal to the original soil) samples were collected for evaluation of the physical and chemical attributes of minesoil. Besides soil, other variables were assessed: plants abundance, height, diameter at breast height as well as litter stock. The treatments did not differ significantly in relation to the effects on abundance, height, diameter and litter stock, either in the planting rows or between them. The organic matter was higher in the Manure treatment at depths of 0.0-0.1 and 0.2-0.4 m. The sawdust coverage between trenches increased Ca and base saturation, but decreased N due to the high Carbon/Nitrogen ratio. Planting using trenches, topsoil, chemical and organic fertilization and sawdust coverage resulted in good physical and chemical properties of the soil and enabled greater efficiency in restoring the area mined for kaolin in the Amazon.

TI  - Diet and Feeding Behavior of Leontopithecus chrysomelas (Callitrichidae) in Degraded Areas of the Atlantic Forest of South-Bahia, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat disturbance alters plant diversity and food resource availability, affecting the ecology, and ultimately the survival and reproduction, of species depending on those plants. Studies in degraded areas serve to improve our understanding of the consequences of habitat modification for endangered species and to guide conservation actions. We studied diet composition, monthly variation in feeding behavior and fruit feeding time, and dietary diversity in two golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) groups ranging in a degraded area of the Atlantic Forest in South-Bahia, Brazil, over a 12-mo period. We recorded feeding behavior and food items consumed through continuous observations and focal animal sampling, and performed dietary analyses on samples from consumed fruits. Substrate manipulation to search for animal prey was the feeding activity most frequently observed, followed by fruit consumption. We observed nectar drinking and exudate feeding at low frequencies from April through July. Bromeliads were the principal foraging substrate. We observed the use of 114 plant species, confirming the large dietary diversity reported for the species. Individual trees from the family Melastomataceae, common in degraded forests, accounted for the highest visiting frequencies (40%). Fruit availability was the main factor explaining variation in monthly fruit feeding time, despite the absence of climatic seasonality. Nutritional or energetic characteristics did not affect fruit choice. Differences in floristic composition appear to be a major determinant of the species' diet in different study areas. Regional forest restoration programs should consider including advanced forest species, to improve both forest quality and animal mobility between fragments.

TI  - Environmental assessment based on soil loss, deforestation in permanent preservation areas, and water quality applied in the Itacaiúnas Watershed, Eastern Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand how various environmental pressures may threaten the Amazon territory, specifically its hydrographic basins, it is crucial to guide key management actions such as soil conservation, environmental preservation, and forest restoration. This paper, based on a detailed study conducted in the Itacai & uacute;nas River Watershed (IRW) located in the Carajas mining province-one of the most significant metallogenetic provinces globally and within the Arc of Deforestation in the Amazon-proposes a new index to assess environmental threats or vulnerabilities. The index evaluates soil loss, deforestation in permanent preservation areas, and water quality-key environmental issues in watershed management. Using geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques, we applied the index across the entire catchment area and at the beginning of the drainage network (a proxy for river springs). Our findings reveal that: i) 68% of unit catchments (32% of headwaters) exhibit "High" or "Very High" soil loss vulnerability; ii) 69% of unit catchments (32% of headwaters) have more than 20% of their permanent preservation areas deforested, representing the primary threat among the three criteria to the basin; iii) Only 4.7% of unit catchments (2% of headwaters) present any chemical risk related to water consumption. The combined criteria (simple arithmetic mean of normalized values) indicate that the east-central and southern parts of the watershed have higher index values, necessitating greater attention to soil conservation. In contrast, the center-western area of the basin, characterized by conservation units and indigenous land, showed low index values but remains at risk primarily due to soil loss if environmental preservation actions are not maintained.

TI  - Species distribution relationships of different strata and soil characteristics in an alluvial forest in Parana State, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Species distribution relationships of different strata and soil characteristics in an alluvial forest in Parana State, Brazil). Soil characteristics are the most important factors influencing species distribution in alluvial forests. Here we evaluated species composition, diversity and structure of three forest strata and their relationship with soil characteristics in a fragment of alluvial forest in the Iguacu River basin, Parana state. We asked if forest structure and diversity can be explained by edaphic and hydrological factors. We evaluated structural variables and floristic composition of three forest strata: regeneration stratum (20 cm <= height <= 1.30 m; 80 subplots, 1 mx1 m), intermediate stratum (perimeter at breast height - pbh < 15 cm, height > 1.30 m; 20 subplots, 5 mx5 m) and upper stratum (pbh >= 15 cm, 20 subplots, 10 mx10 m). In addition, we correlated species abundance with soil parameters in each subplot. The forest was characterized by a low diversity (Shannon's index: regeneration stratum = 2.36; intermediate stratum = 2.49; upper stratum = 1.59) and high floristic similarity among strata (Sorensen index >= 0.65). The relationship of species spatial distribution and soil characteristics was distinct among strata: species distribution was correlated with soil water-table levels and organic matter content in the upper stratum and with soil water-table levels and aluminum concentration in the intermediate stratum. On the other hand no significant correlation was verified in the regeneration stratum. Our results suggest that community structure and floristic composition in alluvial forests reflect different interactions during individual life cycles.

TI  - The challenge of maintaining Atlantic forest biodiversity: A multi-taxa conservation assessment of specialist and generalist species in an agro-forestry mosaic in southern Bahia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments have highlighted the importance of forest amount at large spatial scales and of matrix quality for ecological processes in remnants. These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, Suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Broad-scale spatial patterns of canopy cover and pond morphology affect the structure of a Neotropical amphibian metacommunity
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and environmental processes influence species composition at distinct scales. Previous studies suggested that the distribution of larval anurans at the landscape-scale is influenced by environmental gradients related to adult breeding site selection, such as pond canopy cover, but not by water chemistry. However, the combined effects of spatial, pond morphology, and water chemistry variables on metacommunity structure of larval anurans have not been analyzed yet. We used a partial redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to analyze the relative influence of pond morphology (e.g., depth, area, and aquatic vegetation), water chemistry, and spatial variables on a tadpole metacommunity from southeastern Brazil. We predict that pond morphology and canopy cover will influence the metacommunity at broad spatial scales, while water chemistry would play a larger role at finer scales. We found that broad-scale spatial patterns of pond canopy cover and pond morphology strongly influenced metacommunity structure, with water chemistry being not significant. Additionally, species composition was spatially autocorrelated at short distances. We suggest that the reproductive behavior of adult anurans is driving tadpole metacommunity dynamics, since pond morphology, but not water chemistry affects breeding site selection by adults. Our results contribute to the understanding of amphibian species diversity in tropical wetlands.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Microorganisms are useful environmental indicators, able to deliver essential insights to processes regarding mine land rehabilitation. To compare microbial communities from a chronosequence of mine land rehabilitation to pre-disturbance levels from references sites covered by native vegetation, we sampled non-rehabilitated, rehabilitating and reference study sites from the Urucum Massif, Southwestern Brazil. From each study site, three composed soil samples were collected for chemical, physical, and metagenomics analysis. We used a paired-end library sequencing technology (NextSeq 500 Illumina); the reads were assembled using MEGAHIT. Coding DNA sequences (CDS) were identified using Kaiju in combination with non-redundant NCBI BLAST reference sequences containing archaea, bacteria, and viruses. Additionally, a functional classification was performed by EMG v2.3.2. Here, we provide the raw data and assembly (reads and contigs), followed by initial functional and taxonomic analysis, as a base-line for further studies of this kind. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of environmental rehabilitation in tropical regions, inspiring further researchers to explore this collection for hypothesis testing.

TI  - FORESTRY RESTORATION IN ABANDONED PASTURES OF Urochloa BY DIFFERENT SIZES OF BRUSHWOOD
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The brushwood is a technique of environmental complexation, which consists in the use of plant residues. This technique, when well established technically, can exert influence on seedbed quality, fostering native plant establishment and ecosystem restoration. In this way, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of brushwood for the induction of natural regeneration of native species in an area covered by exotic inhibitory grasses of the genus Urochloa, as well as check the minimum size required to prevent the re-invasion of the forage. As a hypothesis, we adopted the minimum width of 4 m as sufficient for the establishment of natural regeneration prior to the reoccupation of grasses. The experiment was conducted between May 2014 and May 2016 in MorretesPR in a lowland evergreen rain forest area. Seven different sizes of brushwood were compared: 6 x 1, 6 x 2, 6 x 3, 6 x 4, 6 x 5, 6 x 6 m and control treatment. Woody species were identified and counted and herbaceous cover percentage estimated after 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months. There was no resumption of natural succession of native species. At any size, brushwood alone was ineffective to prevent the growth by grasses from the edges of the plots, and, since it constitutes a residue pile, it further complicates the establishment of woody species. For the creation of safe sites and consequent restoration by natural regeneration, there is a need for local elimination of Urochloa forages, without which native species are unlikely to survive.

TI  - Restoration of seasonal semideciduous forests in Brazil: influence of age and restoration design on forest structure
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the high rates of deforestation in tropical regions, the restoration of degraded lands has become an important way for maintaining the diversity of plant communities and for creating wildlife habitats. Evaluating the success of restored areas is essential for improving restoration designs and for successfully restoring such complex ecosystems. In this study, the development of restoration forests with respect to age (5, 9 and 10 years old) and the restoration models used (proportion of pioneer trees) was assessed along the margins of Companhia Energetica do Estado de Sao Paulo (CESP) reservoirs, located in the region of Pontal do Pananapanema, in Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. The overstory (trees greater than or equal to4.8 cm in DBH) was assessed in nine 900 m(2) permanent plots, and all woody understory regenerating plants (>50 cm in height and <4.8 cm in DBH) were counted and identified in 54 1 m radius subplots. Canopy and grass cover were assessed in the wet and dry seasons. All of the parameters were recorded again I year later to evaluate the development of the forests. In general, neither the restoration design nor age appeared to influence forest structure and dynamics, at least at the developmental stage studied here. The floristic complexity and density of regenerating individuals were still fairly low compared to natural forests. The arrival of propagules from other forest remnants was insignificant, suggesting that inadequate seed dispersal and faunal colonization limited species enrichment within the restoration sites. Although the overall results suggested that these restoration forests had reached a structural complexity sufficient to give a start to secondary succession, some factors such as the dominance of pioneer trees in the overstory, the small number of colonizing individuals arriving from external seed sources, the persistence of weedy grasses in the understory and the degree of isolation of the restoration sites may endanger the sustainability of these forests in the long term. Although neither the age nor restoration model produced differences in the forest structure and dynamics, it is possible that such differences may require a longer time to develop. Monitoring restoration sites is essential for understanding a forest's trajectory and for guiding management and intervention practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of direct-seeding, bare-root and polybag methods on early growth, root structure and plant establishment cost of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla)
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical tree species restoration programs require effective, low-cost plant establishment methods. The aim of this research was to compare seedling survival, growth and cost for four plant establishment methods for mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a high-value tree species that is widely cultivated in community forests and industrial forest plantations in Indonesia. A randomised block design with four blocks and four planting-stock types (direct seeding, direct seeding with seed briquettes, planting with bare-root seedlings, and planting with seedlings raised in polybags) was used to assess tree survival and growth at 12 months old at the Parung Panjang Forest Research Station in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. Estimated costs were calculated based on 1000 target trees for each planting-stock type. The study found that trees grown from polybag seedlings had the highest survival (93.3%) and growth (height, diameter and biomass), as well as greatest taproot length and biomass, although the root structure was spiral due to suboptimal root growth in the nursery. Trees raised from direct seeding with seed briquettes had the second-highest survival rate (67.7%) and better sturdiness quotient, basal root numbers and biomass, with a more naturally developed root structure, and trees grown from bare-root seedlings had the worst growth performance and root structure. In terms of plant establishment costs, the cost of direct seeding with seed briquettes was almost half that of planting polybag seedlings and may have lower environmental impact because it avoids plastic waste. Therefore, direct seeding with seed briquettes can be recommended as an alternative method of forest and land rehabilitation using mahogany, especially in remote areas.

TI  - Effects of landscape configuration and composition on phylogenetic diversity of trees in a highly fragmented tropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Fragmentation of tropical forests is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A key question is understanding how fragmentation impacts phylogenetic diversity, which summarizes the total evolutionary history shared across species within a community. Conserving phylogenetic diversity decreases the potential of losing unique ecological and phenotypic traits and plays important roles in maintaining ecosystem function and stability.2. Our study was conducted in landscapes within the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled living trees with d.b.h. >= 4.8 cm in 0.1 ha plots within 28 fragment interiors and 12 fragment edges to evaluate the impacts of landscape configuration, composition and patch size, as well as edge effects, on phylogenetic diversity indices (PD, a measure of phylogenetic richness; MPD, phylogenetic distance between individuals in a community in deep evolutionary time; and MNTD, phylogenetic distance between each individual and its nearest phylogenetic neighbour).3. We found that PD and MPD were correlated with species richness, while MNTD was not. Best models suggest that MPD was positively related to edge density and negatively related to the number of forest patches, but that there was no effect of landscape configuration and composition metrics on PD or MNTD, or on standardized values of phylogenetic structure (sesPD, sesMPD and sesMNTD), which control for species richness. Considering all selected models for phylogenetic diversity and structure, edge density and number of forest patches were most frequently selected.4. With increasing patch size, we found lower PD in interiors but no change at edges and lower sesMNTD regardless of habitat type. Additionally, PD and sesMNTD were higher in interiors than at edges.5. Synthesis. Changes in MPD and sesMNTD suggest that extirpation of species at edges or in highly fragmented landscapes increases the dominance of species within a subset of clades (phylogenetic clustering), likely those adapted to disturbance. Smaller patch sizes are phylogenetically diverse and overdispersed, probably due to an invasion of edge-adapted species. Conservation must enhance patch area and connectivity via forest restoration; pivotally, even small forest patches are important reservoirs of phylogenetic diversity in the highly threatened Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - Reconciling different interests in the Hutan Harapan rainforest ecosystem restoration management in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hutan Harapan is the last remaining lowland tropical rainforest in Sumatra, with an area of ca. 100,000 ha (hectares). It was granted by the Ministry of Forestry to a private company (PT REKI) with an Ecosystem Restoration Concession (ERC) license to carry out forest restoration. ERC is a new market-oriented policy option in Indonesia that promotes private investment in restoring and managing production forests to reverse deforestation and contribute to ambitious global restoration targets. Despite being a logged-over area, Hutan Harapan is still rich in biodiversity, home to the Batin Sembilan indigenous people and the Malay tribe, as well as many migrants. However, Hutan Harapan has become a forest island surrounded by oil palm plantations, monoculture industrial timber estates, and agricultural lands. As a result, Hutan Harapan has become highly accessible and exposed to threats such as encroachment, illegal logging, poaching, and forest fires. This study presents lessons from PT REKI's experience in the forest in addressing complex issues and threats with different management approaches. Stakeholder analysis, participation and social capital theory, and ladder participation theory are used to analyze the forest management approach taken by PT REKI. This company has implemented stakeholder engagement strategies in its operations, used social capital in conflict resolution and law enforcement, conducted tiered participation, and promoted multipurpose forest management to address threats, deforestation, encroachment, forest fires, and other illegal activities. Using these approaches, PT REKI has delivered a remarkably positive outcome, as evidenced by declining rates of deforestation and illegal activities, effective conflict resolution, prevention of forest and land fires, and garnering support from surrounding concessionaires and other stakeholders. It has resulted in land use stabilization, reduced social costs, a positive corporate image, and broader stakeholder support, instilling hope for the future of forest management. PT REKI, however, still faces many challenges due to heightened social pressures, wildlife poaching, and land clearing for oil palm development.

TI  - Long-Term Integrated Systems of Green Manure and Pasture Significantly Recover the Macrofauna of Degraded Soil in the Brazilian Savannah
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy soil biota is the key to meeting the world population's growing demand for food, energy, fiber and raw materials. Our aim is to investigate the effect of green manure as a strategy to recover the macrofauna and the chemical properties of soils which have been anthropogenically degraded. The experiment was a completely randomized block design with four replicates. Green manure, Urochloa decumbens, with or without application of limestone and gypsum, composed the integrated systems. The macroorganisms as well as the soil fertility were analyzed after 17 years of a process of soil restoration with the aforementioned systems. The succession of Stizolobium sp. with Urochloa decumbens, with limestone and gypsum, was teeming with termites, beetles and ants. This integrated system presented the most technically adequate indexes of diversity and uniformity. Multivariate models showed a substantial increase in the total number of individuals due to the neutralization of harmful elements and the gradual release of nutrients by limestone and plaster. These conditioners have undergone multiple chemical reactions with the substrate in order to balance it chemically, thus allowing the macroinvertebrates to grow, develop, reproduce and compose their food web in milder microclimates. It was concluded that the integration of green manure together with grass is an economical and environmentally correct strategy to restore the macrofauna properties of degraded soil in the Brazilian savannah.

TI  - Variability among mother trees of Ceiba speciosa St. Hil for characteristics of the fruits and seeds
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ceiba speciosa St. Hil. (Malvaceae), known locally as paineira-rosa, is an arboreal species of great importance in the recovery of degraded ecosystems, and whose wood and kapok are used for various economic activities. This study evaluated variability and repeatability for the biometric characteristics of fruit and seeds, and seed quality between mother trees of C. speciosa. Fruit was collected from 36 mother trees and the diameter, length, fresh and dry weight and number of seeds in five fruit, and the length, diameter and 100-seed weight in 100 seeds were determined. The physiological quality of the seeds was evaluated by germination and by the following tests for vigour: germination speed index, accelerated ageing (EA), electrical conductivity (EC) and submersion of the seeds in water. Four replications of 25 seeds were used, except for the tests of EC and submersion, where 40 seeds were used in each replication. After the tests for EA and submersion, the seeds were submitted to the germination test. The mean values for the parent trees were compared by Scott-Knott test, and the genotypic coefficient of determination, the repeatability and correlation between characteristics were estimated. The characteristics under evaluation display significant variability between the mother trees, suffering little effect from the environment. The correlation between biometric characteristics and germination and seed quality is low. The repeatability coefficients are high, and the evaluation of five fruits and 100 seeds per mother tree, employing four replications in the tests for germination and vigour, offers good reliability for determining the variability of the species.

TI  - REFORESTATION DYNAMICS IN AREAS OF RESTORATION AFTER MINING IN UNIT OF FOREST CONSERVATION IN THE AMAZON
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper was to evaluate density of planting, of mortality and annual periodic increment (API) of growth in diameter and height of species used in reforestation in areas of forest restoration after mining in conservation units in Amazonia. It was also analyzed the soil management practices in plantation areas. The monitoring covered a period of 13 years (1996-2009), at the National Forest Saraca Taquera, in Porto Trombetas, Para State, Brazil. The species were distributed in classes of mortality. We analyzed the size and the ecological suitability, based on mortality and growth increments (diameter and height) of the species in the artificial ecosystem restored. The annual periodic increment of diameter considering the studied species allowed the following classification: excellent (7 species), high (33), low (20) and very low (9) and similarly, the grow of tree height it was found: excellent (9 species), superior (20), low (31) and very low (9). The ecological aptitude of 69 species in the study area, based on mortality and the increments in diameter and height, allowed the identification of the following groups of species aptitude: excellent (3), good (16), regular (25), low (21); improper (20) and inept (5). The use of soil practices during the activities of restoration should be reviewed due to strong evidence of mortality and growing of planted trees being influenced by soil storage time, the amount of top soil spread superficially, the acidity and fertility of soil and the top soil depth and the distance of transport to the target areas.

TI  - Physiological responses to extreme hydrological events in the Pantanal wetland: heterogeneity of a plant community containing super-dominant species
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsWe tested two mechanisms of adaptation to extreme hydrological stresses (flooding and drought) of species making up a tropical wetland plant community by measuring leaf gas exchange and water potential. We hypothesized that anoxic conditions that occur during flooding will decrease leaf gas exchange when compared to the dry season, and that super-dominant' species will have a distinctive physiological advantage when compared to other plants within the community.LocationNorthern Pantanal wetland, Private Natural Heritage Reserve of the Brazilian Social Service of Commerce (RPPN-SESC Pantanal), Mato Grosso, Brazil.MethodsTwo periods representing typical extreme hydrological conditions in the Pantanal wetland were selected based on historical soil and meteorological measurements: (1) a drought period when plants experience stress due to soil moisture deficits during a dry season that persists for several months (May to Sept), and (2) a flooding period when oxidation-reduction potential is negative for 30d or more (Mar or Apr), indicating anoxic stress. Measurements of gas exchange and leaf water potential were made on seven species in drought and flood stress conditions. The seven species represent the majority of the plant community.ResultsAs a whole, the plant community showed significantly lower potential net photosynthesis (P-N) during flooding when soil oxidation-reduction potential reached close to -900 mV when compared to the dry season, but the magnitude of the decline in P-N was species specific. Not all super-dominant species showed higher P-N compared to non-dominant species, but they did demonstrate higher stomatal conductance and transpiration leading to lower water use efficiency. The combination of higher P-N despite low soil water content suggests that the plant community had access to deep water resources. This access was also confirmed by the midday leaf water potential, which was similar for the flood and dry seasons.ConclusionsResults suggest that the plant community may have high physiological performance under a wide range of soil oxidation-reduction potentials. Higher P-N rates of super-dominant species indicate a physiological advantage of these species in the different hydrological conditions.

TI  - Improving reintroduction planning and implementation through quantitative SWOT analysis
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades have seen increasing use and importance of translocations and reintroductions as tools for species' conservation and ecological restorations. Most such efforts face substantial logistical complexities and high costs, both biological and financial. These and other challenges have contributed to numerous failures or partial successes of reintroductions, a trend which has improved little over time. Given the negative ramifications of reintroduction failures, practitioners have adopted or developed numerous analytical and procedural methods in efforts to promote successful outcomes. However, many such methods are often ad hoc or taxon-specific, particularly regarding the evaluation and selection of reintroduction areas and sites. Despite the recognized importance of this phase of reintroduction planning, there is to date no comprehensive methodology for selecting suitable reintroduction sites. We describe in detail the application of quantitative SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for objectively evaluating candidate reintroduction areas or sites, and how results of this analysis are used for identifying the most effective and efficient management actions for promoting reintroduction success. We use examples drawn from recent reintroduction plans for three avian species in Puerto Rico (1) and Brazil (2) to illustrate specific methodologies used as well as the results obtained and their application to the reintroduction planning and implementation process. From our findings, quantitative SWOT analysis is a simple, versatile, repeatable and intuitive method for reintroduction area and site selection. The method also provides a valuable mechanism for evaluating and prioritizing management actions relative to their efficiency and effectiveness for achieving reintroduction objectives.

TI  - Eucalyptus plantations as hybrid ecosystems: Implications for species conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel and hybrid ecosystems present different conservation values for native species. Therefore, the classification of modified ecosystems into a novel or hybrid state is an essential step to assist conservation strategies for biodiversity. During the last decades, plantations of Eucalyptus have increased in the highly threatened Atlantic Forest region, highlighting the importance of defining this ecosystem as novel or hybrid. In this study, we evaluated whether Eucalyptus plantations are novel or hybrid ecosystems by contrasting biotic components (dung beetle communities) and abiotic components (local environmental variables) within historical (Atlantic Forest remnants) and non-historical (pasture) environments in the Atlantic Forest biome, located in Bahia state, Brazil. Our results show that Eucalyptus plantations should be classified and managed as a hybrid ecosystem in this biome. Of the 21 dung beetle species found in Eucalyptus, ten were shared with historical forests (52.6% of Eucalyptus species) and 6 with pastures (31.5%). Eucalyptus plantations have environmental aspects similar to both historical forests and pastures. Despite presenting similar components to historical and non-historical ecosystems, Eucalyptus plantations are sufficiently distinct not to be classified as either one of them. Our results highlight the potential conservation value of Eucalyptus plantations in the Atlantic Forest region as complementary habitat for historical species, and we discuss how alternative management at landscape and stand (local) scales might increase this value. Although dung beetles are an excellent group to monitor biodiversity, we reinforce the necessity to perform further studies using another taxon that present different ecosystem requirements.

TI  - A process-based model for quantifying the effects of canal blocking on water table and CO2 emissions in tropical peatlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage in tropical peatlands increases CO2 emissions, the rate of subsidence, and the risk of forest fires. To a certain extent, these effects can be mitigated by raising the water table depth (WTD) using canal or ditch blocks. The performance of canal blocks in raising WTD is, however, poorly understood because the WTD monitoring data are limited and spatially concentrated around canals and canal blocks. This raises the following question: how effective are canal blocks in raising the WTD over large areas? In this work, we composed a process-based hydrological model to assess the peatland restoration performance of 168 canal blocks in a 22 000 ha peatland area in Sumatra, Indonesia. We simulated daily WTD over 1 year using an existing canal block setup and compared it to the situation without blocks. The study was performed across two contrasting weather scenarios representing dry (1997) and wet (2013) years. Our simulations revealed that, while canal blocks had a net positive impact on WTD rise, they lowered WTD in some areas, and the extent of their effect over 1 year was limited to a distance of about 600 m around the canals. We also show that canal blocks are most effective in peatlands with high hydraulic conductivity. Averaging over all modeled scenarios, blocks raised the annual mean WTD by only 1.5 cm. This value was similar in the dry (1.44 cm) and wet (1.57 cm) years, and there was a 2.13 fold difference between the scenarios with large and small hydraulic conductivities (2.05 cm versus 0.96 cm). Using a linear relationship between WTD and CO2 emissions, we estimated that, averaging over peat hydraulic properties, canal blocks prevented the emission of 1.07 Mgha(-1) CO2 in the dry year and 1.17 Mgha(-1) CO2 in the wet year. We believe that the modeling tools developed in this work could be adopted by local stakeholders aiming at a more effective and evidence-based approach to canal-block-based peatland restoration.

TI  - Active Restoration Initiates High Quality Forest Succession in a Deforested Landscape in Amazonia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia is well known for its high natural regeneration capacity; for this reason, passive restoration is normally recommended for the recovery of its degraded forests. However, highly deforested landscapes in southern Amazonia require active restoration. Since restoration methods can shape the quality and speed of early forest recovery, this study aimed to verify how active restoration pushes sites stably covered with exotic grasses towards forest recovery. We evaluated early forest succession at active restoration sites, i.e., soil plowing, direct seeding of pioneer species, and seedling stock planting at low density. We analyzed forest structure, diversity, and species composition in two age classes, 0.5-3.5 and 4.5-7.5 years old. As reference, we evaluated sites able to naturally regenerate in the same region. We sampled 36 active restoration and 31 natural regeneration sites along the Madeira River, southern Amazonia. Active restoration triggered succession to similar or higher levels of forest structure than sites where natural regeneration was taking place. The most dominant species did not overlap between active restoration and natural regeneration sites. The overall composition of species was different between the two restoration methods. Dominant species and size class distribution show that active restoration is performing successfully. Soil preparation combined with a high availability of seeds of pioneer trees resulted in a high stem density and basal area of facilitative pioneer trees. Planted seedlings added species diversity and increased density of large trees. Interventions to increase the odds of natural regeneration can be effective for non-regenerating sites in resilient landscapes.

TI  - Distance to forest, mammal and bird dispersal drive natural regeneration on degraded tropical peatland
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of peat swamp forest (PSF) on degraded Southeast Asian peatlands could reduce global carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. However, multiple ecological barriers are believed to hinder natural regeneration of native trees on degraded peatland and make restoration expensive. We evaluated if natural PSF regeneration occurs and what factors may influence it on eight different land use and land cover (LULC) classes with different types of disturbance, including drainage and fire, in a retired Acacia crassicarpa Benth. (Acacia) plantation landscape. The study involved 42 plots inside five PSF LULCs - intact, logged, burnt (1997, 2015), remnant and 212 plots at distances up to 2 km from the PSF edge in three Acacia plantation LULCs - unharvested, harvested, and burnt. The number of species per plot were similar between intact PSF (25 +/- 6 (SD) per 20 m x 10 m plot), logged forest (30 +/- 6) and 1997 burnt forest (30 +/- 13) but lower in 2015 burnt forest (11 +/- 10) and remnant forest (18 +/- 11). Regeneration away from the PSF across all degraded LULCs varied from fern dominated areas with no regeneration to clusters with high stem densities. The plantation LULCs, unharvested (94 species) and harvested Acacia (71 species), had similar overall species diversity after 3-4 years of regeneration to the intact and logged PSF (90 species). In unharvested Acacia, total species diversity, species per plot and stem density decreased with distance from forest edge (1-300 m - 87 species; 9 +/- 6 (SD) species per 20 m x 10 m plot; 1,056 stems/ha; 301-500 m - 33; 5 +/- 2; 511 and > 500 m - 38; 6 +/- 3; 683). In harvested Acacia, there was low plot species diversity irrespective of distance from the forest (1-300 m - 51; 4 +/- 2; 578; 301-500 m - 17; 4 +/- 2; 1,100; > 500 m - 48; 4 +/- 2; 780). Factors which may influence regeneration differed between different LULCs, but there was a clear influence of distance from forest edge and dispersal mechanism - i.e. whether a tree was bird or mammal dispersed and the interaction between these two factors. While our study suggests that if not further disturbed by logging, drainage and/or fire, degraded PSF could regenerate naturally to a similar species diversity as intact PSF, the lower levels of natural regeneration further away from the forest may warrant selective planting of species which do not disperse over long distances. More study is needed on the factors facilitating natural regeneration, whether it leads to restoration of PSF ecosystem functioning and the role of Acacia as a potential regeneration catalyst.

TI  - Fire effect on the natural regeneration and litter accumulation in Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study and evaluation of restoration indicators is fundamental to define measures and to monitor degraded areas. In a secondary semi-deciduous seasonal forest area, with 16 years of natural regeneration, the fire effects and the proximity to native forest patch on the yield and accumulation of litter was evaluated. A total of 20 plots of 9 m(2) were demarcated, all individuals with DGL >= 30cm and CBH <= 15cm were identified and the litter of each plot (0.25 m(2)) and at adjacent fragment was collected. Twelve species and nine families were identified. The Shannon' index (H' = 0.427) and the equability (J' = 0.166) showed a low floristic diversity, aside from the dominance of Mabea fistulifera (VI = 76%). Significant influence of the distance of adjacent forest on the fireaffected area and litter production was observed. The enrichment with species to increase the local diversity and to leverage the restoration process of the area is recommended.

TI  - Effectiveness of ant communities to detect anthropogenic disturbance in Neotropical forest landscapes: a case study in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how communities respond to anthropogenic disturbance is considered a stepping-stone to support decision-making by environmental managers and restoration ecology. In endangered biodiverse regions, such as the Neotropics, ecological indicators are particularly useful, by enlighten possible diversity trends and functional shifts. Our objectives were to deepen our understanding on the soil ant assemblages/habitat relationships in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly relevant for a data-deficient and fast changing region, and evaluate if regional ant assemblages, collected within a gradient of disturbance, could fulfill the surrogate role. A sampling effort of 630 pitfall traps and litter collection were used for monitoring ant communities within the gradient of habitats considered. Sequential reductions in ant richness, abundance and simplification of assemblage compositions were detected along the disturbance gradient comprising pristine forests, secondary forests, agriculture and pastures. Additionally, indicator species identified could be used to assess the disturbance level but also to guide restoration efforts in this region. Finally, even though late secondary forests displayed diverse assemblages, old-growth/pristine forests support distinct communities, highlighting its critical contribution for the conservation of ants.

TI  - CUTTING AND EFFECT OF THE WATER DEFICIT OR FLOODING ON MORPHOANATOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF Cestrum axillare Vell.
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem of riparian forests has been the subject of numerous studies and research in recent years. However, due to microclimate conditions in these areas, little is known about the species with potential for use in forest restoration projects, since in the same place, it may be conditions of low water availability and floods over a year. Also, the search for alternatives for the planting of seedlings in river borders is essential since it is an enabling environment to erosion, and planting by cuttings is a possibility because there is no need for soil disturbance. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of rooting of stem cuttings of Cestrum axillare Vell. and its morphological and anatomical plasticity in conditions of low availability of water or inundation of root system in order to verify its potential for use in restoration projects in riparian environments. For that, cuttings were made from a matrix plant in different diameter classes and placed to root. After rooted, the plantlets were planted in containers of 4000 cm 3 and at four months of age, subjected to low availability of water or flooding of root system. Evaluations were conducted throughout the study, covering visual observation and quantification of morphological and anatomical changes through histological sections. From the results, it was found that Cestrum axillare has potential to be propagated by cutting technique and it is indicated for use in restoration of riparian forest projects.

TI  - Integrating indicators of natural regeneration, enrichment planting, above-ground carbon stock, micro-climate and soil to asses vegetation succession in postmining reclamation in tropical forest
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-cast mining in tropical forests causes negative impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Postmining reclamation is therefore imposed to recover the vegetation despite the lack of understanding which indicators can be used to monitor the progress of succession. This study proposes an integrated framework to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in coal mining site in East Kalimantan, Borneo. We combine the indicators of floristic diversity of naturally growing terrestrial and epiphytic plants, survival and growth of enrichment planting of native plants, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the measurements on micro-climate and soil conditions. We compare some indicators across the 9-year-old and 17-year-old reclaimed sites and the premining sites. The results showed that naturally growing vegetation at the reclaimed sites was at the early to midsuccession stages, with biodiversity indicators much lower than those at the premining areas, implying the necessity of native species planting. During a six-month monitoring, the enrichment planting of native species had high rates of survival and growth. Surprisingly, the above-ground carbon at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining sites. While the micro-climates had been improved, the soils in the reclaimed sites were still in poor conditions. Our findings suggest that using single parameter to monitor the trajectory of vegetation succession in postmining reclamation can be biased, and integrating several monitoring measures would provide a much better assessment.

TI  - Weed control, large seeds and deep roots: Drivers of success in direct seeding for savanna restoration
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We aimed to evaluate the performance of native tree species in the restoration of savanna vegetation by direct seeding, to assess whether weed control and intercropping with native grasses can contribute to the success of this method and to determine whether species performance can be explained by functional traits.Location Cerrado biome, southeastern Brazil. Old fields abandoned after decades of land use as pasture or croplands, occupied by ruderal plants and invasive grasses.Methods We established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species native to the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region. We used a factorial design in five blocks, with the following factors: (a) species; (b) weed control and (c) intercropping with native grasses. We evaluated the emergence, survival and growth of plants, and through multiple regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct seeding based on their functional traits.Results Emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species but with little or no difference between treatments. Growth was compromised by weed competition in all species. Intercropping with native grasses did not decrease weed competition. We found a functional pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding, where survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass, root depth and a greater root:shoot ratio.Conclusion Weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival, considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding. The success of this method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root system. Characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding.

AB  - Urban green spaces have the reputation of limited potential to support biodiversity and public places located in urbanized regions normally sustain low levels of biodiversity. But there is the potential to improve such characteristics using restoration techniques that are easily implemented and cost-effective. In this study we implemented a set of nature-based interventions aiming to boost the local biodiversity of three urban parks in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Our interventions were designed to induce local ecological succession. In each park, we prepared nine sampling units (SU) by removing grass in a circle of 1 m diameter each. During the period of the study, three Sus in each park were kept uncovered (control treatment), three received -forest litter collected in an adjacent, well-conserved forest fragment (transposition treatment), and in the other three SUs, we installed a perch (perch treatment). For one year following establishment of the treatment, we monitored each SU biweekly and recorded the number and identity of seedlings that germinated in the circles. We recorded fluctuations in the number of seedlings in all experimental treatments of the three parks, indicating the variable rate of survivorship among species. We recorded a total of 30 different genera, most of which were herbaceous plants of species native to the region. In terms of the category of seed dispersion syndrome, most seedlings were from species dispersed by abiochoric vectors. Asteraceae was the most common botanical family. On one hand, if the experimental techniques we tested did not achieve the expected success in terms of the number of species of shrubs and trees, on the other hand, such interventions were not harmful in that they did not result in a predominance of exotic species. We conclude that this kind of approach has the potential to be successfully implemented in urban green spaces due to the simplicity of elaboration and implementation, respect of the natural structure and functioning (it is a nature-based alternative), and with an appropriate cost-benefit.

TI  - Defining Eco-Morphodynamic Requirements for Rehabilitating Eroding Mangrove-Mud Coasts
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an eco-morphodynamic analysis on causes of erosion along degraded mangrove-mud coasts, and the causes of failure to rehabilitate these coasts. Our analyses are based on studies in Thailand, British Guyana and Suriname, and observations in Indonesia, the Philippines and southern China, where degradation is directly attributed to the erection of fish/shrimp ponds too close to the waterline. Ecological determinants of low success rates of rehabilitation efforts are well explained in literature, and are briefly summarized in this paper. Our analyses show that ongoing erosion of degraded mangrove-mud coasts are also the result of a disturbed balance in fine sediment dynamics, and the subsequent change in mudflat morphology. The initial drivers for this degradation are a decrease in on-shore sediment flux and a local increase in wave height near the fish/shrimp ponds. A positive feed-back loop is initiated by which stable, convex-up cross sectional profiles of mud flats evolve towards unstable, concave-up profiles. This loop is induced by an unfavorable feedback between tide-induced sedimentation and wave-induced erosion, deteriorating habitat conditions for mangrove recruitment. Based on the current analysis, we present ingredients for a more sustainable use of mangrove-mud coastal systems, and a more successful rehabilitation of eroding mangrove-mud coasts.

TI  - Collaborative Watershed Modeling as Stakeholder Engagement Tool for Science-Based Water Policy Assessment in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a collaborative modeling process deployed at the Cantareira Water Supply System (CWSS) in Sao Paulo City Metropolitan Area, Brazil. The CWSS faces challenges for meeting the increasing water demand, while land-use and climate change and their combined effect on its water cycle and balance have created a complex water resources management problem. Through a stakeholder engagement process-involving scientists and policymakers, the water utility company, and state administration-environmental simulation models were developed to elicit and represent multiple environmental, economic, and policy perspectives, developing a mutual language to communicate and establish common goals of water resources management. Study outputs include estimation of biophysical and economic benefits associated with prioritized native vegetation restoration activities in the source watersheds. These outputs are deployed in support of landscape planning and the decision process integrating multiple stakeholder perspectives in Sao Paulo state administration, the water utility company, and municipalities.

TI  - Interspecific insect relationships on Terminalia argentea (Myrtales: Combretaceae) trees in the Cerrado biome
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terminalia argentea Mart. (Combretaceae), native to Brazil, is used in habitat restoration programs. Arthropods are bioindicators because their populations reflect changes in the environment. We evaluated the recovery of a degraded area by using ecological indices and analyzing arthropod interactions on T. argentea plants. The richness and diversity of sap-sucking Hemiptera and the abundance of tending ants and Sternorrhyncha predators increased with the number of T. argentea leaves. The correlation of the abundance of tending ants and Sternorrhyncha predators was positive with that of the sap-sucking Hemiptera, and the abundance of Sternorrhyncha predators was negative with that of tending ants and sap-sucking Hemiptera. The positive correlation between the abundance, richness, and diversity of insect groups and numbers of T. argentea leaves is an example of the bottom-up regulation mechanism, with the population dynamics of the lower trophic levels dictating those of higher trophic levels. The contribution of T. argentea, a host plant of many arthropods, to the recovery of ecological relationships between organisms in degraded ecosystems is important.

TI  - Integrating environmental variables by multivariate ordination enables the reliable estimation of mineland rehabilitation status
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the wide variety of variables commonly employed to measure the success of rehabilitation, the assessment and subsequent definition of indicators of environmental rehabilitation status are not simple tasks. The main challenges are comparing rehabilitated sites with target ecosystems as well as integrating individual environmental and eventually collinear variables into a single tractable measure for the state of a system before effective indicators that track rehabilitation may be modeled. Furthermore, a consensus is lacking regarding which and how many variables need to be surveyed for a reliable estimation of rehabilitation status. Here, we propose a multivariate ordination to integrate variables related to ecological processes, vegetation structure, and community diversity into a single estimation of rehabilitation status. As a case, we employed a curated set of 32 environmental variables retrieved from nonrevegetated, rehabilitating and reference sites associated with iron ore mines from the Urucum Massif, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. By integrating this set of environmental variables into a single estimation of rehabilitation status, the proposed multivariate approach is straightforward and able to adequately address collinearity among variables. The proposed methodology allows for the identification of biases towards single variables, surveys or analyses, which is necessary to rank environmental variables regarding their importance to the assessment. Furthermore, we show that bootstrapping permitted the detection of the minimum number of environmental variables necessary to achieve reliable estimations of the rehabilitation status. Finally, we show that the proposed variable integration enables the definition of case-specific environmental indicators for more rapid assessments of mineland rehabilitation. Thus, the proposed multivariate ordination represents a powerful tool to facilitate the diagnosis of rehabilitating sites worldwide provided that sufficient environmental variables related to ecological processes, diversity and vegetation structure are gathered from nonrehabilitated, rehabilitating and reference study sites. By identifying deviations from predicted rehabilitation trajectories and providing assessments for environmental agencies, this proposed multivariate ordination increases the effectiveness of (mineland) rehabilitation.

TI  - Natural regeneration and biodiversity: a global meta-analysis and implications for spatial planning
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

T2  - Hoehnea
M3  - Article
AB  - (Differential timing response of Herbivory-Induced Volatiles (HIPVs) in Croton floribundus Spreng. (Euphorbiaceae)). In this study, we demonstrated that Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), a generalist herbivore , induces volatile organic compounds (VOC) in Croton floribundus Spreng., a pioneer species widely used in Brazilian urban area. We performed experiments to evaluate the quality and quantity of VOC emission at different times (two, six and 24 hours and within four and nine days) of infestation by T. urticae. Results show that C. floribundus emitted 23 volatiles after infestation, including monoterpene, sesquiterpene and green leaf volatiles. Significant differences were only detected between infested and non-infested plants after 24 hours of treatment, in particular methyl salicylate. In contrast, 3-hexen-1ol, linaool, geranyl acetone and caryophyllene seem to be inhibited by hourly infestation. The alpha-farnesene, methyl salicylate, 3-carene, 3-hexen-1ol benzoate and nerolidol were the main compounds induced after four infestation-days. This study highlights that VOCs blends in C. floribundus is depended on the feeding time-course of T. urticae and suggests that the VOC-mediated ecological interaction may be less efficient in a pioneer species.

TI  - Achieving Quality Forest and Landscape Restoration in the Tropics
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is being carried out across the world to meet ambitious global goals. However, the scale of these efforts combined with the timeframe in which they are supposed to take place may compromise the quality of restoration, and thus limit the persistence of restoration on the landscape. This paper presents a synthesis of ten case studies identified as FLR to critically analyse implemented initiatives, their outcomes, and main challenges, with an eye to improving future efforts. The identified FLR projects are diverse in terms of their spatial coverage, objectives; types of interventions; and initial socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental conditions. The six principles of FLR-which have been widely adopted in theory by large global organisations-are inadequately addressed across the initiatives presented here. The identified FLR project or interventions, although expected to offer diverse benefits, face many challenges including the lack of long-term sustainability of project interventions, limited uptake by regional and national agencies, limited monitoring, reporting and learning, poor governance structures, and technical barriers, which are mainly owing to institutional weaknesses. On the basis of these cases, we propose that the best pathway to achieving FLR is via an incremental process in which a smaller number of more achievable objectives are set and implemented over time, rather than setting highly ambitious targets that implementers struggle to achieve.

TI  - Litter addition as a tool for restoring hydrological processes and controlling erosion in riparian forests disturbed by fine sediment deposition
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverscape aggradation due to the deposition of fine particles above natural forest litter can change the soil, sediment, and water properties, damage riparian vegetation, and reduce environmental integrity, especially in headwater streams. Litter addition techniques that enhance surface roughness and permeability can decrease the interference of fine particles on the ecosystem, representing a low-tech alternative to recover disturbed riparian areas. We aimed to evaluate run-off, percolation, storage coefficients, run-off volume, and sediment yield using a rainfall simulator and the mitigation potential provided by the addition of forest litter to limnological variables-turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), electrical conductivity, pH, nitrogen-which are indicators of integrity that can reflect streams' aggradation. Fifteen soil samples from a disturbed area (silt and clay deposits aboveground), five from an undisturbed area (sandy soil), and superficial forest litter were obtained from riparian areas adjacent to two small streams in Carajas National Forest, Brazil. The addition of litter showed great potential to mitigate erosive processes and to reestablish hydrological processes in the disturbed soil. The run-off volume and sediment yield were 2-4 times lower in litter addition treatments compared to non-litter addition. Litter addition also improved run-off water quality, especially turbidity and TSS, which were 12-16 times and 3-13 times lower, respectively. The experimental addition of litter has shown encouraging results to be applied in situ as a sustainable, low-cost, and simplified nature-based solution to contribute to the restoration of degraded riparian forests and reduce in-stream silt and clay aggradation.

TI  - TREE SPECIES DIVERSITY, STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CARBON STOCK IN A ONE-HECTARE PLOT OF THE PROTECTION FOREST AREA IN WEST LAMPUNG REGENCY, INDONESIA
T2  - Reinwardtia
M3  - Article
AB  - A study of species composition, structure and carbon stock in the lower montane forest in the Register 45B of the protection forest area in the Tri Budi Syukur District, Kebun Tebu Village, West Lampung Regency, Lampung Province was conducted in September 2016. The objective of the study was to undertake quantified measurements of floristic composition and structure of and carbon storage in the lower montane forest at 965 m asl in the protection forest area. A one hectare plot (100 m x 100 m) was established randomly. The plot was further divided into 25 subplots of 20 m x 20 m each to record trees. Quadrats of 5 m x 5 m for saplings and subquadrats of 2 m x 2 m for seedlings were nested in the tree subplots. We recorded 247 trees with diameter at breast height >= 10 cm representing 25 species and 19 families, with a total basal area of 59.14 m(2). Overall including seedlings and saplings we recorded 31 species. The species richness was very low due to disturbances, and was the lowest compared to that of other forests in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java. The dominant species in terms of importance values (IV) were Litsea cf. fulva (IV=77.02), Lithocarpus reinwardtii (IV=45.21) and A ltingia excelsa (IV=26.95). Dominant species in seedling and sapling stages were Polyalthia lateriflora (IV=27.54) and Memecylon multiflorum (IV=41.58). Biomass and carbon stock of trees with DBH >= 10 cm was 50.87 ton/ha and 25.43 ton C/ha, respectively. Regeneration was poor. Structurally and floristically the forest was a developing disturbed forest and the composition will remain unchanged in many years to come. The successions leading to terminal communities similar to the original conditions would be very slow and should be assisted and enhanced by applying ecological restoration through planting tree species native to the site.

TI  - Spatial pattern of a fish assemblage in a seasonal tropical wetland: effects of habitat, herbaceous plant biomass, water depth, and distance from species sources
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of habitat, biomass of herbaceous vegetation, depth and distance from permanent water bodies on the structure of fish assemblages of a seasonal floodplain was evaluated using data collected along 22 transects in an area of 25 km(2) in the floodplain of Cuiaba River, Pantanal, Brazil. Each transect was sampled for fish using throw traps and gillnets during the flood period of 2006. Multivariate multiple regression analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that depth was the only variable that affected the structure of the fish assemblage, both for quantitative data (abundance) and qualitative data (presence-absence). Species such as Neofundulus parvipinnis and Laetacara dorsigera were more abundant in shallower sites (below 25 cm), while Serrasalmus maculatus and Metynnis mola were found mostly in the deepest areas (over 55 cm). However, species such as Hoplias malabaricus and Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus occurred at all sampled depths. Although the distribution of most species was restricted to a few sites, there was a positive relationship between species richness and depth of the water body. Surprisingly, the replacement of native vegetation by exotic pasture did not affect the fish assemblage in the area, at the probability level considered.

TI  - Soil seed bank in restored areas in southern Mato Grosso do Sul state - MS
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the seed bank of three different areas under restoration process after 12, 13 and 16 years of implantation, located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Twenty samples (20cm x 20cm) were collected inside each forest restored in randomly distributed points, at a depth of 0 to 5cm, considering the litter. After being placed in plastic trays, the samples were irrigated and monitored daily for a period of approximately three months (90 days). The species were also evaluated according to their dispersal syndrome, adopting the morphological criteria of the fruits as anemocoric, zoochoric, and autocoric, besides being classified according to the way of life and origin. Seed bank diversity was estimated through Shannon diversity index (H') and Pielou Equity (J'). These analyzes were performed using the Fitopac 2.0 program. It was found that the composition of the herbaceous community varied with the localities, being the highest viable seed density for this class observed in Ivinhema, where the seed bank was composed mainly of spontaneous herbs from anthropized areas around the area and high density of seeds. seedlings of the Poaceae family, with four distinct species. The Jatei area presented a high density of Cecropia pachystachya Trecul. Seedlings, as well as four other distinct tree species. The restored area of Caarapo presented different vegetation classes and the presence of important succession components such as trees and vines. In the three seed banks evaluated, there was the presence of tree species representing an advance in the successional process of each area.

TI  - Biodiversity and Conservation of Tropical Peat Swamp Forests
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forest is a unique ecosystem that is most extensive in Southeast Asia, where it is under enormous threat from logging, fire, and land conversion. Recent research has shown this ecosystem's significance as a global carbon store, but its value for biodiversity remains poorly understood. We review the current status and biological knowledge of tropical peat swamp forests, as well as the impacts of human disturbances. We demonstrate that these forests have distinct floral compositions, provide habitat for a considerable proportion of the region's fauna, and are important for the conservation of threatened taxa, particularly specialized freshwater fishes. However, we estimate that only 36% of the historical peat swamp forest area remains, with only 9% currently in designated protected areas. Given that peat swamp forests are more vulnerable to synergies between human disturbances than other forest ecosystems, their protection and restoration are conservation priorities that require urgent action.

TI  - Reforestation can compensate negative effects of climate change on amphibians
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use change are major drivers of biodiversity loss, but their combined effects are still unclear. Reforestation may compensate or reduce climate change impacts on species, but this hypothesis has not been tested yet. Here we quantify the additive and synergistic effects of forest change - in particular, reforestation - and climate changes on ten endemic and forest-dependent anurans of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future (2050) conditions, using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive land-use model. We contrasted a pessimistic landuse scenario, with little change in forest cover, with an optimistic scenario, with forest gain through restoration of "legal reserve" areas. Our models show that climate change will have species-specific effects on anurans, increasing climatic suitability for seven species, but decreasing for three. For these three species, we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change, increasing overall environmental suitability. These results reinforce the importance of ensuring reforestation and forest protection as a climate change adaptation strategy for biodiversity.

TI  - Late Holocene in central Brazil: vegetation changes and humidity variability in a tropical wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pandeiros wetland is a high biodiversity ecosystem located within a semiarid region of the Cerrado biome, a neotropical savanna. This large wetland is of key importance for ecological and hydrological balance in central Brazil and for the conservation of the Cerrado fauna and flora. In this study, we present the first palaeoecological investigation of the Pandeiros wetland based on pollen analysis of a palm swamp sediment core encompassing the Late Holocene. Our results show that the wetland was subject to multicentennial-scale oscillations in water availability during the Late Holocene; in particular, higher local humidity was documented between 4100 and 3100 cal a bp and from 2600 to 1000 cal a bp, and two events of drier local conditions occurred at approximately 2900 and 900 cal a bp. Our results also indicate a general decreasing trend in arboreal density in the Pandeiros River Basin from the beginning of the Late Holocene to the present, with the greatest expansion of dry forest occurring between 3600 and 3100 cal a bp.

TI  - EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE DITCHES ON WATER TABLE LEVEL, SOIL CONDITIONS AND TREE GROWTH OF DEGRADED PEATLAND FORESTS IN WEST KALIMANTAN
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - peatland forests are under considerable pressure because of increasing deforestation and degradation of forests. In Kalimantan, degradation and deforestation of peatland forests are driven primarily by industrial logging, expansion of agricultural activities through primarily conversion of forests to agricultural land and oil palm plantations. By the establishment of intensive drainage, it can induce wildfires in peatland. Unmanaged drainage ditches will alter water table levels within the site adjacent to the drainage including to surrounding peatland forest. Water table assessments were conducted before and after peatland drainage on 2007/2009 and 2012/2015 in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan. This paper studies the effect of drainage ditches into the peat land water table. Results show the establishment of drainage ditches on this peatland landscape lowered the water table by more than 3 times from similar to 11.7 cm (SE = 1.5, n = 5) to similar to 37.3 cm (SE = 2.1 cm, n = 26). The effect on the water table was in drier months of July-August. Lowering the water table level altered worst the soil micro climate, peat temperature and peat water content. The results indicate the land use changes in peatland with the establishment of drainage affects peatland water table currently. In the area of less than 500 m from the drainage, the water level tends to lower toward the drainage feature. Therefore, recovery of peatland forests should be initiated by managing the landscape hydrology (i.e. water table) to restore the ecosystem and to protect the remaining peat swamp forest.

TI  - Does the degradation of histosols due to recurrent fire affect the establishment of a hygrophilal autochthonous tree species?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Islands and their adjacent natural grasslands are vulnerable and sensitive ecosystems to the actions of severe fires, which result in losses of their resilience, which makes the potential of passive restoration of these environments unfeasible after such events. This study aims to verify, through an autochthonous species exclusive to these Forest Islands, whether it can develop in Histosols around a Forest Island that has been degraded by fire for years. The place of study and collection of the material tested was in the Sempre-Vivas National Park. Histosols samples were collected for analysis of chemical and physical attributes and experimental conduction in a seedling nursery. The performance of Richeria grandis was evaluated in these Histosols from seed vigor tests, initial plant growth in a greenhouse. R. grandis manages to develop in Histosols around the degraded Forest Island, disregarding possible interspecific field competitions. The physical and chemical characteristics of the Histosols around the island do not prevent the effective restoration of this phytocenosis. R. grandis showed the same seed vigor for all Histosols tested and all seedlings survived until the end of the experiment. It was observed that the seedlings grown in the Histosols of the island of the forest, showed a behavior of greater height, number of leaves and moisture content, and the place with exposed Histosols, with the highest fire severity, provided the lowest development in height, diameter and number of leaves. According to ecophysiological analyses, the species is under some environmental stress regardless of the treatment.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST: PASSIVE RESTORATION, NUCLEATION AND HIGH DIVERSITY PLANTATION
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing environmental degradation, the understanding of how reforestation and other restoration techniques function became fundamental to base the reestablishment of degraded ecosystems. The aim of this study was to perform a vegetation survey in a restoration site through three different techniques. The study site has 7.2 ha in a subtropical forest in Dois Vizinhos, Parana state, Brazil and it is approximately 20 m from a secondary forest fragment. The experiment consisted of 12 plots with three treatments (T1-3) randomly distributed in four blocks. T-1: natural regeneration through passive restoration. T-2: set of nucleation techniques. T-3: seedlings planted through filling and diversity lines (3x2 m). For sampling purposes, each plot was divided into 24 subplots. In order to evaluate plant presence, two years and eight months after the treatments implementation, a survey was conducted in three random subplots for each plot, where all plants taller than 50cm were identified and quantified. Native species richness was higher than 87% in all treatments, whereas the presence of herbaceous species was higher at passive restoration and woody species at plantation. The most common dispersal syndromes were anemochory and zoochory. By comparing planted and regenerated individuals for the three treatments, the plantation technique had the highest Shannon diversity index (3.017), with 148 individuals and 53 species sampled. However, there was no statistically significant difference. This higher diversity is related to the larger number of species planted, but it is still not facilitating regeneration species in its understory at this age. Considering only regenerated individuals, nucleation showed the highest Shannon diversity index (2.078) with a total of 908 individuals of 40 species, however, it wasn't statistically significant different of passive restoration (Shannon = 1.965) which had 2,018 individuals of 40 species. The most floristic similar treatments were passive restoration and nucleation. Nucleation facilitated species natural regeneration (17 planted and 40 regenerated species) while passive restoration showed high resilience, therefore the use of passive restoration can be considered an effective alternative since its results did not differ statistically from nucleation, and the main advantage of this technique is the reduced cost.

TI  - Ants as Indicators of the Success of Rehabilitation Efforts in Deposits of Gold Mining Tailings
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of the success of restoration efforts is an essential step for environmental monitoring programs, providing reliable and intricate information on the response of biotic and abiotic elements of ecosystem following the restoration programs adopted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different rehabilitation efforts after gold mining activities using ants as bioindicators. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the ant species richness and composition vary with the technique of revegetation and (2) the number of epigaeic and hypogaeic ant species increases with resources. We selected four tailing dumps from gold mining, one spontaneously revegetated (Natural) and the other three areas with different rehabilitation techniques, namely: Grassy 2005rehabilitation with grasses in 2005; Grassy 2006rehabilitation with grasses in 2006, and Shrubby 2004rehabilitation with grasses, herbaceous, and shrubs in 2004. Ants were sampled using epigaeic and hypogaeic pitfall traps. Species accumulation curves show that the Natural area has a higher number of species. We found differences in species composition of epigaeic and hypogaeic ants among the different areas sampled. We conclude that Camponotus fastigatus can be taken as a good indicator of environmental rehabilitation in areas impacted by mining activities. Moreover, Ectatomma edentatum, Dorymyrmex brunneus, Crematogaster evallans, and Solenopsis invicta can also indicate that the rehabilitation process is not yet completed.

TI  - Floristic composition, diversity and structure of shrub-arboreal vegetation of caatinga under silvicultural systems
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to investigate the floristic composition, the diversity and structural parameters provided by four silvicultural systems to arboreal-shrub vegetation in two areas Caatinga. The first area is in the Serido Ecological Station (SES) and the second is on Pedro Candido Farm (PCF), in the county of Serra Negra do Norte-RN. The silvicultural systems used were: general cut; selective cut of individuals with base circumference > 8 cm; general cut of all individuals and subsequent burning of crop residues; general cut with subsequent burning of crop residues and removal of stem from soil. It was determined: floristic composition, species richness, diversity, density of stems, absolute dominance, periodic increase and average annual increment (1989-2016). The diversity (J ') was compared by Tukey's test (P < 0,05). The species richness presented conditions similar to those at the time of the installation of the experiment. The greater abundance of some species contributed to the reduction of diversity measured by the Shannon-Weaver Index, in relation to 1989. The increases provided by silvicultural systems varied according to the area, with tendency to reduce of rate the growth in both. The regeneration time (27 years) was not sufficient for the complete restoration of absolute dominance.

TI  - Pasture Recovery Period Affects Humic Substances and Oxidations of Organic Matter in Eastern Amazon
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land management practices that overlook soil limitations and potential have led to varying degrees of degradation. This study evaluates the carbon content in chemical and oxidisable soil fractions across different pasture recovery periods, comparing them to secondary forests. The management practices assessed include the following: secondary forest (SF), perennial pasture (PP), perennial pasture recovered five years ago (P5), and perennial pasture recovered eight years ago (P8), all on Plinthosols. We analysed carbon levels in oxidisable fractions and humic substances at depths of 0-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m, 0.20-0.30 m, and 0.30-0.40 m. The SF and P8 areas showed the highest organic matter content within the humic fractions, compared to the PP and P5 areas. Additionally, the P8 area demonstrated an increase in the labile and moderately recalcitrant fractions of organic matter, standing out among the different fractions evaluated. The multivariate principal component analysis indicated that P8 has the greatest impact on soil quality, followed by FS, P5, and PP. The pasture recovery over the past eight years has significantly improved soil carbon accumulation, highlighting the benefits of land restoration.

TI  - Assessing the potential for avifauna recovery in degraded forests in Indonesia
T2  - RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuing disappearance and degradation of primary tropical rainforests in Indonesia, and the ongoing conversion of degraded forest to monoculture plantations, threaten many bird species with local extinction. Yet, information on bird populations from the Sundaic region, which covers western Indonesia, is generally lacking, limiting our understanding of species responses to disturbance, extinction risks, and potential ways to counteract local species extinction processes. On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, bird density information is only known from two studies ( on four hornbill species and one pheasant species). Here, we compare bird densities between less degraded and highly degraded forests within the Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra. From a total of 148 bird species recorded, densities were calculated for 47 species with the highest encounter rate, 33 of which were recorded in forests of both disturbance levels, allowing comparisons to be made. We found five species with higher densities in the highly degraded forest and seven species with higher densities in the less degraded forest. While our species-specific results were generally consistent with previous biological insights, there were exceptions, such as a species previously considered to be sensitive to habitat degradation, the sooty-capped babbler Malacopteron affine, being more abundant in the highly degraded forest. Our study revealed that despite its condition, degraded forest retains much value for Sumatran lowland forest birds, providing a compelling argument for securing its important conservation status under improved management, rather than assigning it for clearance as typically happens.

TI  - EFFECTS OF ROOT DEFORMATION AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY ON GROWTH AND BIOMASS ALLOCATION OF Senna multijuga SEEDLINGS (Rich) H. S. Irwin & Barneby
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of root deformation caused by errors in the pricking-out process in forest nurseries are still unknown for tropical tree seedlings. We analyzed the effects of light availability and root deformation on growth and biomass allocation in seedlings of Senna multijuga, a pioneer tropical tree commonly used in forest restoration programs. Our hypotheses were: (a) as a typical light-demanding species, the seedlings of S. multijuga may have their growth compromised by low light availability; (b) root deformation impairs growth rates and induces changes in biomass allocation; and (c) the effects of low light availability on growth and biomass allocation are increased by root deformation. Seedlings with and without root deformation were cultivated for 43 days under three levels of total daily photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (28, 12, and 1 mol photons m(-2) day(-1)). Seedlings of S. multijuga had their growth rates severely affected by values of PAR at about 1 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), but root deformation did not affect the relative growth rates of the whole plant. Instead, root deformation caused a decrease in the relative growth rate of roots in all light availabilities. The changes in root growth affected biomass allocation to the roots. The interactive effects of light availability and root deformation on the allocation of biomass to leaves are more pronounced at low light availability. Root deformations may lead to the production of seedlings with a low competitiveness capacity regardless of light conditions.

TI  - Seeds network and collective action for the restoration and conservation of Xingu River's springs (Mato Grosso, Brazil)
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, indigenous and non-indigenous people from the Xingu-Araguaia region met in Mato Grosso to celebrate 10 years of partnership and collective action of the Xingu Seeds Network (XSN). This network originated from the Campaign 'Y Ikatu Xingu, a social phenomenon concerning conservation and protection of the Xingu spring region. The river basin of the Xingu headwaters, 17 million hectares. is the main focus of XSN and it has lost five million hectares of forests and cerrados, which were converted into grain monoculture fields, within a very short period of time. The impact on the quality of the river water caused an environmental and health problem for the indigenous peoples of the indigenous lands. XSN has promoted innovative technological alternatives for recovery of permanent preservation areas (PPAs) or gallery forest and income generation for small farmers and local communities. The goal of this study is to analyze the environmental governance in the Xingu basin, paying particular attention to institutional arrangements of the Xingu Seeds Network. This analysis is grounded on the theoretical-methodological framework, contained in the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD), which offers tools for understanding the strengthening process of democratic institutions in the protection of common-pool resources. These are permanent preservation areas, in Brazilian case. This study provides a reflection of governance mechanisms, based on the "Commons Theory", in regions where socioeconomic dynamics drastically modify the tropical ecosystems that are fundamental to wildlife and human life.

TI  - Carbon accumulation in the soil and biomass of macauba palm commercial plantations
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Commercial cultivation of the Macauba palm is growing due to its agro-energy potential. This study quantified carbon stock in two macauba plantations (4.8 and 9.0 years old), considering carbon stored in soil and biomass. We assessed total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in labile (EOC and LF-C) and non-labile (NL-C) soil fractions, comparing these with a forest regenerating for over 30 years. Soil samples were collected within the palm plantation (rows and inter-rows) and the forest area at five depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-100 cm). The impact of plantation age and sampling position on TOC stocks and organic matter fractions across different soil layers (0-100 cm) was assessed. The Carbon Management Index (CMI) was calculated to evaluate carbon recovery. Plantation age and sampling position influenced soil TOC stocks across all depths up to 1 m. Higher TOC and NL-C soil stocks were observed in the older plantation (9.0 years) and inter-row. EOC and LF-C fractions varied by soil layer. The inter-row region of the 9.0-year-old plantation exhibited higher carbon recovery based on the CMI. Over 4.2 years of palm cultivation (between 4.8 and 9.0 years), carbon accumulation in biomass and soil reached 75.36 Mg C ha- 1 . These findings underscore the potential of commercial macauba plantations to enhance soil carbon stocks rapidly, particularly in inter-row areas. Plantations younger than a decade surpassed the soil carbon stock of a forest regenerating for over 30 years, highlighting significant environmental benefits of macauba cultivation, including soil and biomass carbon sequestration.

TI  - Governing Forest Landscape Restoration: Cases from Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration includes both the planning and implementation of measures to restore degraded forests within the perspective of the wider landscape. Governing forest landscape restoration requires fundamental considerations about the conceptualisation of forested landscapes and the types of restoration measures to be taken, and about who should be engaged in the governance process. A variety of governance approaches to forest landscape restoration exist, differing in both the nature of the object to be governed and the mode of governance. This paper analyses the nature and governance of restoration in three cases of forest landscape restoration in Indonesia. In each of these cases, both the original aim for restoration and the initiators of the process differ. The cases also differ in how deeply embedded they are in formal spatial planning mechanisms at the various political scales. Nonetheless, the cases show similar trends. All cases show a dynamic process of mobilising the landscape's stakeholders, plus a flexible process of crafting institutional space for conflict management, negotiation and decision making at the landscape level. As a result, the landscape focus changed over time from reserved forests to forested mosaic lands. The cases illustrate that the governance of forest landscape restoration should not be based on strict design criteria, but rather on a flexible governance approach that stimulates the creation of novel public-private institutional arrangements at the landscape level.

TI  - Flooding and fire frequency promotes beta diversity in tree and non-tree species in tropical wetlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between high fire frequency and long flooding seasons maintains open vegetation in floodplains, while low fire frequency and no flooding can lead to forest development. In the Kadiwe<acute accent>u Indigenous Territory (IT), in the ecotone between the Cerrado and the Pantanal biomes in Brazil, the diversified spatio-temporal patterns of fire activity affect the diversity of floral functional traits and plant phenological strategies. Given this scenario, we sampled tree and non-tree species abundance data in 156 plots subject to different flood levels and fire frequencies in the Kadiwe<acute accent>u IT. Based on flooding regimes and fire frequency data series from 2001 to 2021, we classify the sample sites as floodable or flood-free areas under high (annual or biennial burn), moderate (three-yearly burn), or low (burning at four-year intervals or more) fire frequency. We analyzed the effects of flooding and fire frequency on plant species richness, abundance, and beta diversity (beta). In general, tree density did not affect non-tree species richness. The species richness on the patches with different fire frequency category was generally similar, especially regarding the tree species. However, the combined effect of fire and flooding shifted the species composition. Variability in fire frequency across the landscapes support beta-diversity maintenance in ecotonal vegetation between tropical wetlands and savannas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between floodable and flood-free areas at the same fire frequency category is low due to differences in abundance and species replacement. As part of adaptive fire management, we suggest maintaining a heterogeneous mosaic of fire frequencies in the landscape.

TI  - Canal blocking optimization in restoration of drained peatlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drained peatlands are one of the main sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally. Emission reduction and, more generally, ecosystem restoration can be enhanced by raising the water table using canal or drain blocks. When restoring large areas, the number of blocks becomes limited by the available resources, which raises the following question: in which exact positions should a given number of blocks be placed in order to maximize the water table rise throughout the area? There is neither a simple nor an analytic answer. The water table response is a complex phenomenon that depends on several factors, such as the topology of the canal network, site topography, peat hydraulic properties, vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions. We developed a new method to position the canal blocks based on the combination of a hydrological model and heuristic optimization algorithms. We simulated 3 d dry downs from a water saturated initial state for different block positions using the Boussinesq equation, and the block configurations maximizing water table rise were searched for by means of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. We applied this approach to a large drained peatland area (931 km(2)) in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our solution consistently outperformed traditional block locating methods, indicating that drained peatland restoration can be made more effective at the same cost by selecting the positions of the blocks using the presented scheme.

TI  - Modeling the influence of forest cover on streamflows by different approaches
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many controversies about the effect of forest cover on basin streamflows. The objective of this paper was to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to provide hydrological modeling of streamflows of a Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest watershed, simulating land use change scenarios with increasing and decreasing forest cover. Regarding the afforestation scenarios, the influence of the geographic location on the afforestation was also evaluated through two approaches: a) a "random" approach (RA), in which the location of reforested areas does not matter; and b) an "imposed" approach (IA), in which the geographical positions of the afforestation are precisely defined. The RA results showed little tendency of reduction in the simulated average and minimum flows with the afforestation. The IA approach showed that the geographic position of afforestation did not significantly interfere in the average flows, but interfered in the simulated minimum flows. Afforestation concentrated in areas close to streams caused a reduction in minimum flows, while its concentration in the upper parts of the basin managed to increase them.

TI  - Prioritization of peatland restoration and conservation interventions in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are of global significance for biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, as well as of national and local significance for water management and livelihood support. Despite their importance, in tropics these ecosystems remain among the least investigated and monitored and are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities. To support the ongoing formulation, refinement and implementation of peatland restoration and conservation activities in Indonesia, we developed a methodology based on land cover and land productivity analysis, which will help prioritize interventions in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. Results showed that of the analysed peatland area, approximately 45.5% should be conserved, 28.7% should be restored and 16.2% should be subjected to sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, the analysis showed that only 15.6% of the peatlands in need of conservation measures are currently protected, resulting in a necessary expansion of protected areas of about 84%. This study is intended as a tool for policy makers to guide future action, emphasising that conservation and restoration efforts in Indonesian peatlands should be increased, and providing spatial guidance for their implementation.

TI  - Recovery quality index as a tool for monitoring the mined land reclamation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecosystems are being severely degraded, leading the United Nations to deem 2021-2030 as the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. To be successful, this effort requires robust monitoring tools to assess land reclamation practices. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of recovery efforts in mined areas by developing a Recovery Quality Index (RQI) based on soil and vegetation indicators. Using the heavily mined Iron Quadrangle region of Brazil as an example, four undisturbed reference areas were selected: Atlantic Forest; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation; ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation; and quartzite rupestrian grassland. Four areas directly or indirectly affected by mining were selected, including an environmental compensation area set aside 5 years prior to the study, two sterile piles that had undergone recovery for 15 and 20 years, and a cave area with 15 years of recovery. Two vegetation parameters and 34 soil attributes were used in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select indicators and scores. Vegetative parameters had the lowest RQI weights. Soil physical indicators tended to be the most important. RQI values were lowest when Atlantic Forest was used as the reference, showing that the forest was a unique ecosystem, and the cave site had lower RQI scores than the other restored sites, indicating the high degree of disturbance that occurred in that low-lying area. The oldest sterile pile tended to have higher RQI values than the newest and similar values to the less disturbed compensation areas. The recovery quality index values were similar in all areas, with 5 to 20 years in the recovery process, showing that the rehabilitation process is slow in this environment.

TI  - Occupation of artificial microhabitats by soil invertebrates in a forest fragment in Southern Brazil
T2  - Neotropical Biology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of the soil system and loss of organic layer can cause a decrease in the biodiversity of soil fauna, directly affecting its functional characteristics. Strategies that aim at ecological restoration of degraded areas, must take into account the heterogeneous nature of original systems, especially in the soil surface. The general objective of this study was to investigate the importance of cryptic microhabitats; for soil invertebrate communities, through the introduction of artificial structures (mud tiles) on the litter fall. The study area consisted of native forest fragment in Triunfo, RS, Brazil, in which 40 mud tiles were distributed. Every quarter, for a year, 10 tiles were surveyed and 10 litter samples (control group) were collect. A total of 1025 individuals were found distributed in 17 taxonomic groups of invertebrates under the tiles and 935 individuals in 13 groups in the litter fall (control). It was verified that ants and harvestman had been more abundant under tiles than in the control. The abundance of spiders and molluscs was not significantly different between treatments. There were larger amounts of beetle, woodlice and immature insects in the litter fall samples. The mean richness of taxa was larger below the tile and a trend of finding more herbivores and omnivores below these structures was observed. The mud tiles, in this experiment, had fulfilled its task to supply basic information on the importance of cryptic microhabitats for the invertebrate fauna. More research needs to be conducted to clarify and establish the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the dynamics on the soil-litter system for restoring degraded areas.

TI  - Monitoring of deforestation events in the tropics using multidimensional features of Sentinel 1 radar data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries and regions are currently developing new forest strategies to better address the challenges facing forest ecosystems. Timely and accurate monitoring of deforestation events is necessary to guide tropical forest management activities. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is less susceptible to weather conditions and plays an important role in high-frequency monitoring in cloudy regions. Currently, most SAR image-based deforestation identification uses manually supervised methods, which rely on high quality and sufficient samples. In this study, we aim to explore radar features that are sensitive to deforestation, focusing on developing a method (named 3DC) to automatically extract deforestation events using radar multidimensional features. First, we analyzed the effectiveness of radar backscatter intensity (BI), vegetation index (VI), and polarization feature (PF) in distinguishing deforestation areas from the background environment. Second, we selected the best-performing radar features to construct a multidimensional feature space model and used an unsupervised K-mean clustering method to identify deforestation areas. Finally, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results in Paraguay, Brazil, and Mexico showed that (1) the overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score (F1) of 3DC were 88.1-98.3% and 90.2-98.5%, respectively. (2) 3DC achieved similar accuracy to supervised methods without the need for samples. (3) 3DC matched well with Global Forest Change (GFC) maps and provided more detailed spatial information. Furthermore, we applied the 3DC to deforestation mapping in Paraguay and found that deforestation events occurred mainly in the second half of the year. To conclude, 3DC is a simple and efficient method for monitoring tropical deforestation events, which is expected to serve the restoration of forests after deforestation. This study is also valuable for the development and implementation of forest management policies in the tropics.

TI  - Assessing costs of Indonesian fires and the benefits of restoring peatland
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and drainage has made Indonesian peatlands susceptible to burning. Large fires occur regularly, destroying agricultural crops and forest, emitting large amounts of CO2 and air pollutants, resulting in adverse health effects. In order to reduce fire, the Indonesian government has committed to restore 2.49 Mha of degraded peatland, with an estimated cost of US$3.2-7 billion. Here we combine fire emissions and land cover data to estimate the 2015 fires, the largest in recent years, resulted in economic losses totalling US$28 billion, whilst the six largest fire events between 2004 and 2015 caused a total of US$93.9 billion in economic losses. We estimate that if restoration had already been completed, the area burned in 2015 would have been reduced by 6%, reducing CO2 emissions by 18%, and PM2.5 emissions by 24%, preventing 12,000 premature mortalities. Peatland restoration could have resulted in economic savings of US$8.4 billion for 2004-2015, making it a cost-effective strategy for reducing the impacts of peatland fires to the environment, climate and human health.Deforestation and drainage have made Indonesian peatlands susceptible to burning. Here the authors find that Indonesia's 2015 fires resulted in economic losses totaling US$28 billion, while the area burned and emissions released could have been significantly reduced had restoration been completed.

TI  - EVALUATION OF VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION OF SPECIES EMPLOYED IN EARTHWORK STABILIZATION WITH SOIL BIOENGINEERING TECHNIQUES
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil bioengineering techniques use live construction materials like plants and live cuttings as well as inert materials as structural elements in simple constructions, with the purpose of ecological restoration and soil stabilization. The inert materials used depend on the aims and the local availability, are essentially metal structures, geotextiles, timber, stones or even concrete. These, in addition to provide immediate soil stabilization also supply protection and support for the further development of the vegetation. The vegetative part complements, gradually or entirely, replaces the functions of stabilizing inert components. However, construction works, can only be performed successfully when the vegetation technical characteristics are known and, thus, properly exploited. This research is the result of a sequence of experiments performed with the goal of identifying, among riparian inhabit species, those with vegetative propagation capacity and development. A large part of soil bioengineering models use exclusively that way of propagation. Among the many potentially influential factors in vegetative development, such as survival, rooting and sprouting rate, growth roots and shoots velocity, should be also highlighted, the importance of collecting and planting time for vegetation. Therefore, this study, using experimental plots built in different times of the year, seeks to obtain this information by assessing the survival rate, shoots and roots development using cuttings of six potential species easily found along stream banks in southern Brazil rivers. The tested species are: Calliandra brevipes, Phyllanthus sellowianus, Pouteria salicifolia, Salix humboldtiana, Salix x rubens and Sebastiania schottiana. The experimental results indicate the possibility of using some of these species. Calliandra brevipes, Sebastiania schottiana and Pouteria salicifolia presented lower development than Phyllanthus sellowianus, Salix humboldtiana and Salix x rubens. It was evidenced that the planting season, is less important in species with fast rooting, as Phyllanthus sellowianus, Salix humboldtiana and Salix x rubens, but can be decisive in species with slower rooting, such as Sebastiania schottiana, and can even have an effect on the survival rate of these species.

TI  - Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

TI  - Assemblage and functional categorization of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) from the Pantanal
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is one of the world's largest tropical wetland areas and harbors high mammal biomass. There is no formal list of dung beetle species, and studies on their functional roles have never being carried out in Pantanal. In this study, we identified dung beetle species occurring in the north Pantanal region (Pocone sub-region, Brazil) and studied their functional organization, by measuring morphological, behavioral land phenological traits. We collected 25,278 individuals belonging to 17 genera and 35 species. We identified eight functional groups in the habitat: Noturnal Telecoprids, Diurnal Telecoprids, Nesting Endocoprids, Small Nonrollers, Nocturnal Nester Paracoprids, Big Nesters Paracoprids, Non Nesters Paracoprids and Diurnal Nesters Paracoprids. The functional groups were defined mostly by two reproductive traits and two niche differentiation traits related to the use of fecal resources. This high diversification of both species and functional roles shows the importance of the group in a habitat with strong variation in availability of habitat and resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a phytosociological survey on tree stratum (woody overstory) from a nine-year-old reforestation at a Private Reserve of Natural Heritage, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We evaluated all the specimens from the tree stratum (Circumference at Breast Height (CBH) >= 15 cm). They were obtained from 20 subplots (12.5 x 18 m), located at 20 permanent plots. We evaluated 364 specimens from the tree stratum and found 76 species, 63 genera, and 24 families at a 0.45 ha area. The canopy height ranged from 5 to 11 m. The estimated basal area was 18.29 m(2) ha(-1), and the pioneer species contributed with 69.2 percent of the total plant species. Both basal area and average height parameters increased throughout time, whereas the diversity did not. The diversity index was considered high for a reforestation.

TI  - ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS AS SEED DISPERSAL NUCLEI IN A CERRADO AREA IN TRIANGULO MINEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical artificial structures can serve as artificial roosts attracting birds and increase the seed rain. The purpose of this work was to study the efficiency of different types of artificial roosts as seed dispersal nuclei in a cerrado (Neotropical savannah) area under natural regeneration. Three types of artificial roosts were installed ("X", "3X" and "wire") and the species of birds using them and plant species in the seed rain were monitored for a year. The efficiency of the roosts was measured by comparing the seed rain with natural roosts (control). We recorded 760 individuals of 24 species of birds on the artificial roosts. There were more dispersed seeds under artificial roosts than under natural roosts. We collected 607 samples of feces, 569 under artificial roosts (containing 5252 seeds) and 38 under natural roosts (containing 228 seeds). The seeds were of 21 species/morphospecies. The 3X roost was the most used by birds, but the seed rain was similar between 3X and X roosts. We also recorded more seeds under artificial roosts than under natural roosts. Cyanocorax cristatellus (Curl-crested jay), an omnivorous bird, was the most frequent bird recorded at the artificial roosts and seeds of Miconia species were dominant in the seed rain. Artificial roosts were efficient as seed dispersal nuclei and can be adopted as a method to accelerate the regeneration of degraded areas. Research that focuses on artificial roost structure and the factors that influence the seed rain is useful to define targeted and more efficient strategies to habitat restoration.

TI  - Relationship between ecological parameters and environmental quality of three streams in the upper Parana River basin.
T2  - Biotemas
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic environments frequently suffer great environmental disturbances, and alternative actions for biodiversity conservation must be taken to prevent the reduction of species richness in areas impacted. Given this, we started with the hypothesis that among natural and impacted streams, there are differences in the correlation between ecological parameters and environmental quality. The fish assemblages in three streams in the upper Parana River basin were surveyed, and for each stream the ecological structures were related to environmental quality. Comparisons between the environmental integrity and ecological parameters were made. We collected 8,028 individuals, distributed in 3 orders, 6 families, 9 genera and 11 species. Low values in ecological indexes together with low habitat quality were found for one of the streams (Japira Stream). This is probably because there are a large number of residences in the surrounding area that are degrading the environmental complexity. These facts indicate that restoration measures, such as restructuring the riparian vegetation and offering environmental education programs, must be initiated to promote the recovery and environmental preservation of these areas.

TI  - Understanding and mitigating water resource decline in the deli watershed: a comprehensive analysis
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deli watershed, located in the North Sumatra Province, is part of the Belawan-Ular-Padang River Area, which has the potential to supply raw water to three cities/regencies: Medan City, Deli Serdang Regency, and Karo Regency. According to the Regulation of the Minister of Public Works and Public Housing Number 04/PRT/M/2015, the Deli watershed area is classified as a National Strategic River Area. Despite its potential, the rapid economic growth and population increase have led to changes in land use, which have negatively impacted the carrying capacity of water resources in the Deli watershed. In this study, we used a dynamic system approach and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to assess the condition of the Deli watershed's water resource carrying capacity. The integration of dynamic systems and AHP yielded a water resource carrying capacity index, which describes the condition of the Deli watershed's water resources. Under current conditions, the value of the water resource carrying capacity index of the Deli watershed is expected to decline annually from 2019 to 2028. To increase the carrying capacity of water resources, it is recommended to decrease birth and migration rates, reduce water use, and restore land functions.

TI  - Sustainability of Brazilian forest concessions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm(3). yr(-1) to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location.We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15-20 m(3).ha(-1), a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m(3)ha(-1) every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m(3) (157-159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm(3). When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm(3)yr(-1) (2-17 Mm(3)yr(-1), 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm(3)yr(-1). Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.

TI  - Influence of shading on the initial development and nutrient use efficiency of Dilodendron bipinnatum Radkl (Sapindaceae)
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Initial development, biomass partitioning, seedling quality, concentration of foliar nutrients and nutrient use efficiency of Dilodendron bipinnatum under different shading levels were evaluated. The seedlings were distributed in greenhouses at 0% (full sun), 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% shading. The number of leaves, height, stem diameter at 90, 150, 180, 210, 240 and 270 days after emergence (DAE) was assessed. The stem and root dry mass, Dickson quality index (DQI) of seedling, concentration and efficiency in the internal use of nutrients (EIUN) were also assessed at the end of the experiment (270 DAE). Seedlings submitted to intermediate shading (50 and 70%) showed the best initial development and training of dry mass in different organs, higher DQI and higher EUIN. Thus, a large scale production of Dilodendron bipinnatum seedlings, recommended levels of 50 and 70% shading in order to ensure the production of more vigorous plants.

TI  - TREE VEGETATION AFFECTING SOIL STABILITY, SOIL POROSITY AND SOIL TOTAL NITROGEN IN THE PROTECTED FOREST OF KULON PROGO COMMUNITY FORESTRY, YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to investigate the influence of tree vegetation on basic soil functions reflected by soil structural stability (SSy), soil porosity (SPy), and soil total nitrogen (STN). Data were collected from 35 plots distributed across five stand types in the protected forest of Kulon Progo Community Forestry, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. (Pinus [PN], Aleurites-Swietenia [AS], Swietenia-Acacia [SA], Melaleuca-Acacia [MA], and Tectona-Dalbergia [TD] stands). Comparative analyses were applied to compare SSy, SPy and STN. The influences of tree vegetation and environmental factors on SSy, SPy and STN were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Our results showed that SSy, SPy and STN varied among plots and stand types where those were directly proportional to each other. Overall, PN stands exhibited less values of basic soil functions than other stands. In this regard, tree vegetation provided high influence on SSy, SPy and STN where the most important factor was an interaction among canopy coverage, soil organic matter and soil organic carbon which are directly proportional to each other and negatively correlated to below -stand utilization. Accordingly, dense -canopy trees are highly recommended for species enrichment by considering adaptive management systems, to ensure the ecological restoration process of degraded forests.

TI  - Landscape Geotechnology and Ecology in Monitoring Forest Fragmentation
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to diagnose and analyze the structural connectivity of fragmented landscape surrounding the Conservation Unit Private Reservation of Natural Patrimony Cafundo, proposing the restoration through Ecological Corridors. The mapping of land use and land cover, and landscape ecology indexes allowed detecting, analyzing and understanding the landscape structure. These indexes were calculated using the GeoDMA plugin for the 10 mapped classes. During the study period (1970 and 2007) there have been few changes in the land use and occupation, predominantly to pasture matrix on both dates. The delimitation of Ecological Corridor for the Analytical Hierarchy Process method used each mapped class to set the relative weight for installation. The results showed an increase in the landscape fragmentation allowing the definition of an Ecological Corridor of lower cost as an alternative to increase the connectivity among conservation units.

TI  - Performance assessment of a soil and water bioengineering work on the basis of the flora development and its associated ecosystem processes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest of Brazil is one of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots, but floodplains in this region are continuously converted into agricultural or urban areas, and riverine ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic interventions. Soil and water bioengineering techniques are a component of ecological engineering that can provide nature-based solutions as an alternative or as complementary measures to conventional hydraulic or civil engineering approaches. However, there is a lack of post-evaluation of interventions and there are still great difficulties in identifying valid evaluation criteria and measurement variables, especially in countries like Brazil where soil and water bioengineering measures have only been implemented in the last decade. Another limitation to the widespread application of the techniques is the lack of knowledge about their technical performance, their impact on ecological processes and the evolution of the species used. This study aims to investigate the development of species, evaluate the technical performance of the intervention and assess the ecological benefits and processes of one of the first soil and water bioengineering riparian restoration interventions in Brazil, which was carried out in 2010 on the Pardinho river. Parameters on bank stability, development of species used in different construction techniques and its ecological benefits and ecological processes (plant species and soil fauna richness and diversity, ecological group and recruitment species, invasive species, soil organic matter and soil temperature) were collected over a period of ten years. The study proved that soil and water bioengineering works can both stabilise and control erosion, and at the same time initiate ecological processes on degraded riverbanks. The active introduction of native species has promoted vegetation succession, increased the biodiversity of both plants and soil fauna on the site and improved the site conditions. The establishment of native vegetation led to sediment and organic material deposition, which changed the local ecological conditions (e.g., soil properties, light, flow conditions) and thus facilitated rapid establishment of other plants and re-established interactions between plants and soil fauna groups. This study provides a monitoring approach which examines the technical performance of the measures and species used, as well as their impact on the ecological process over time, which is essential for establishing soil and water bioengineering techniques as the standard in the field of river engineering in Brazil. Furthermore, the results obtained will help in planning and designing future works in the field of soil and water bioengineering in Brazil, adding to the knowledge of the techniques and species to be selected, as well as supporting the evaluation of the success of interventions.

TI  - Morphoanatomical and Biochemical Changes in Seeds of Bagassa guianensis (Moraceae)
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bagassa guianensis Aubl. is a tree of high timber value (Moraceae family) native to the Amazon. In this study, we characterized the morphoanatomical and biochemical properties of Bagassa guianensis seeds at different levels of fruit control based on biometric, morphoanatomical, color and biochemical analyses. Four stages of seed development have been identified in the fruit of Bagassa guianensis. The seeds presented endosperm, being classified as albuminous. Seeds from fruits with 5 GY 4/4 colors and green pigmentation (stage I) presented fully formed embryos. According to PCA (principal component analysis) data, it was found that all stages of seed dominance had a significant effect and highly correlated with the biochemical properties of the seed. Despite the comparatively low biometric values, high levels of Total Soluble Sugars (3.58%), Total Soluble Proteins (2.12%) and Reducing Sugars (1.43%) were observed in seeds at this stage. On the other hand, the content of amino acids (0.87%) and starch (3.30%) was higher at late maturity. The highest amounts of starch were detected from stage II onwards (31.29 mg/g DM), when the seeds reached physiological maturity. Biochemical and morphological information from seeds are relevant for planning conservation, observation and restoration strategies, and this study on the species B. guianensis is essential.

TI  - Recruitment Niches of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong: Functional Acclimations to Light
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjustments that a tree species displays in acclimating to light conditions may explain its fate in different forest successional stages. Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong is a tree found in contrasting light environments and used in reforestation programs because of its rapid growth. This study analyzed the performance of tamboril seedlings grown in three light environments: FSfull sun (100% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a red/far-red ratio (R/FR) of 1.66), Sshade net (38% of PAR and a R/FR of 1.54) and IInsulfilm((R)) (Insulfilm, SAo Paulo, Brazil) shade cloth (24% of PAR and a R/FR of 0.69). Greater net assimilation, higher root/shoot ratio, higher stomatal density, and reduced leaf area are some of the functional traits developed by tamboril to acclimate to full sun. On the other hand, a larger leaf area associated with a greater specific leaf area, higher leaf area ratio, higher leaf number and leafing intensity, as well as higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are among the most important traits for tamboril to acclimate to shade. The seedlings growing in FS displayed the best quality index. However, the traits developed in the nursery under each light condition could promote the successful installation and survival of tamboril seedlings under similar conditions in the field.

TI  - Use of biossolid in plantation of atlantic forest species
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Treated sewage sludge, called biosolid, contains high levels of macronutrients (N, P, Ca, and Mg) and organic matter; therefore, it has great potential for soil fertilization during the implantation of reforestation. Two completely randomized field experiments were carried out in a sandy texture Planosol at Seropedica, RJ. In the first one, initiated in April 2015, the effect of four doses of biosolid (0, 2, 4 and 8 L per plant) and one dose with mineral fertilization (amount of nutrients equivalent to the dose of 4 L of biosolid) on the survival, growth and nutrition of the species Schinus terebinthifolius Radd. (aroeira), Lafoensia glyptocarpa KOEHNE (mirindiba), Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (inga-laurina), e Senna multijuga (Rich.) (pau-cigarra). In the second experiment, started in March 2016 and under the same treatments, the following species were evaluated for 9 months: Genipa americana (Vell.) Brenan (jenipapo), Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub (farinha-seca) and Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong (orelha-de-negro). Increasing doses of biosolid increased the growth rate of S. terebinthifolius and P. dubium. However, the higher dose (8 L) reduced the growth of S. multijuga by up to 50%, while I. laurina, G. americana and E. contortisiliquum did not have their growth affected by the application of biosolids. The application of biosolid increased the leaf content of S in I. laurina, P and Ca in L. glyptocarpa, and Mg in S. multijuga, but it reduced the content of P in G. americana. It can be concluded that the species S. terebinthifolius, L glyptocarpa, P. dubium, I. laurina and S. multijuga benefited from the dose of biosolid of 4 L per plant, either due to the higher growth rate or the higher accumulation of macronutrients.

TI  - Fire incidence in Argentina during the past two decades, and their association with land cover and use in different environmental contexts
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of fire has driven great changes in land cover. Although the occurrence of fires is modulated by climatic conditions and the availability of fuel biomass, human beings have modified historical fire regimes through various mechanisms. Therefore, in many environments, human activities are the main driver of the modern fire regime. In this study, we analyze fire incidence in the Argentine territory for the period 2000-2019. Specifically, we 1) characterize fire occurrence at the provincial level and 2) evaluate the spatial pattern of the burned area (BA); in the areas where BA was concentrated, we 3) describe environmental conditions (climate and vegetation) and 4) evaluate whether different land covers or uses were associated with certain characteristics of the modern fire regime (frequency and extent). Between 2000 and 2019, 47.84 Mha were burned, mainly concentrated in north-central Argentina. Within this area, we differentiated four climatic zones (wich were subtropical-humid, subtropical, temperate and temperate semiarid), six vegetation units (Chaco, Monte, Pampas, Espinal, Yungas, and Parana), and seven conglomerates of spatial association between land cover/uses and fire incidence. Fires associated with high-intensity land use occurred mostly in the subtropical and temperate zones, with vegetation of Chaco and Espinal units. Those related to low-intensity land uses were registered mainly in subtropical-humid and temperate-semiarid zones, with vegetation of Monte and Paranaense units. In most cases, fire was used to reduce or eliminate the cover of native species, either woody or herbaceous vegetation units, to promote the growth of cultivated (cereals, oilseeds) or forage-species (implanted or native), to foster agricultural and/or livestock production, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest that the high incidence of fires in central Argentina was associated with the current productive system.

TI  - Unmasking secondary vegetation dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary vegetation (SV) from land abandonment is a common transition phase between agricultural uses following tropical deforestation. The impact of SV on carbon sequestration and habitat fragmentation across tropical forest frontiers therefore depends on SV dynamics and demographics. Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017. SV increased over time, totaling 12 Mha in 2017, 44% of which was <= 5 years old. Between 1988 and 2017, 19.6 Mha of SV was cleared, adding 45.5% to the area of primary deforestation detected by the Brazilian monitoring system (PRODES). Rates of SV loss have exceeded PRODES deforestation since 2011. Based on the age and extent of gains and losses, SV was a small net carbon sink during this period (8.9 Tg C yr(-1)). As SV is not formally protected by national environmental legislation or monitored by PRODES, long-term benefits from SV in the Brazilian Amazon remain uncertain.

TI  - Fragmentation dynamics and loss of area of potential occupancy within the distribution limits of the endangered crested capuchin monkey (Sapajus robustus)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss is one of the main threats to biodiversity. Fragmentation resulting from this process may restrict available habitat for primates, limiting their persistence in a given region. In this study, we aimed to quantify deforestation and fragmentation by identifying forest remnants capable of maintaining populations of the endangered crested capuchin monkey (Sapajus robustus) within its distributional limits in the states of Bahia, Espirito Santo, and Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used Landsat images from 1985 to 2010 to generate three time-interval mosaics classified by natural and non-natural vegetation. We then calculated the size of the forest remnants and the distance of each fragment of natural vegetation to its nearest neighbor. Between the first (1985-1990) and second (1995-2000) mosaics there was a vegetation loss of 41.4%, and between the second and third (2005-2010) mosaics there was a natural vegetation gain of 1%. The third mosaic showed smaller and more isolated fragments in comparison to the first mosaic. Across the three periods, Bahia was the state with the highest rate of deforestation. While Espirito Santo had fewer identified forest remnants, it retained the most natural vegetation within these small fragments. The landscape within the currently recognized distributional limits of the crested capuchin monkey is dominated by agriculture and livestock. Both decreasing fragment size and increasing species isolation by distance between fragments can negatively affect primate populations, increasing their risk of extinction. Isolation makes it difficult for migration and recolonization events to occur. Therefore, habitat restoration should be prioritized to reduce isolation between populations. Our findings may serve as a resource for future conservation efforts and management of the crested capuchin monkey.

TI  - Monitoring tidal hydrology in coastal wetlands with the "Mini Buoy": applications for mangrove restoration
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring in situ data of tidal flooding is key for the successful restoration planning of intertidal wetlands such as salt marshes and mangroves. However, monitoring spatially explicit inundation time series and tidal currents can be costly and technically challenging. With the increasing availability of low-cost sensors and data loggers, customized solutions can now be designed to monitor intertidal hydrodynamics with direct applications for restoration and management.In this study, we present the design, calibration, and application of the "Mini Buoy", a low-cost underwater float containing an acceleration data logger for monitoring tidal inundation characteristics and current velocities derived from single-axis equilibrium acceleration (i.e. logger tilt).The acceleration output of the Mini Buoys was calibrated against water-level and current-velocity data in the hypertidal Bay of Fundy, Canada, and in a tidally reconnected former aquaculture pond complex in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Key parameters, such as submersion time and current velocities during submergence, can be determined over several months using the Mini Buoy. An open-source application was developed to generate ecologically meaningful hydrological information from the Mini Buoy data for mangrove restoration planning. We present this specific SE Asian mangrove restoration application alongside a flexible concept design for the Mini Buoy to be customized for research and management of intertidal wetlands worldwide.

TI  - Plantation forestry in Brazil: Projections to 2050
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is fortunate in having large areas of land that are not currently forested but that are suitable for silvicultural plantations. Changes in the area and regional distribution of the country's silvicultural plantations imply a wide variety of environmental and social impacts. Projections of future development of plantation silviculture are needed for analyzing these impacts, as well as to serve as a reference scenario for evaluating the potential effects of climatic change on Brazil's plantations, and for the related task of evaluating the implications of proposals to combat global warming by increasing the area of silvicultural plantations in Brazil beyond the extent to which they would otherwise expand. Such a reference scenario provides the control, or "business as usual" standard, against which one can compare the situation as affected by climatic change and/or by additional silvicultural or other activities carried out to help mitigate climatic change. Assuming constancy of climate, technology, per-capita consumption of wood products, and Brazil's share of international trade, the area of plantations in 2050 would be 3.2 times larger than the area in 1991.

TI  - Pioneer herbaceous plants contribute to the restoration of pollination interactions in restinga habitats in tropical Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most endangered biodiversity hotspots in the world and restinga ecosystems are exposed to intense degradation. The restoration of these ecosystems is challenging as there is a lack of understanding, among other aspects, of how plants interact with pollinators. Ecological networks are useful for assessing restoration outcomes as they provide data on the reestablishment of interactions. Here, we evaluated the restoration success of pollination interactions in a restinga in Brazil, by comparing structure, complexity, and robustness of plant-flower visitor networks in newly planted sites (restoration) with target reference sites (control). In the restoration area, more species and interactions were recorded (120 insect species, 25 plant species, and 1,361 interactions) compared to the control area (74, 19, and 471, respectively), mainly due to the high abundance of common insect species. The majority of the interactions in restoration sites (81.1%) occurred with naturally arriving pioneers (68% of plant species visited). While network robustness was significantly higher in restoration sites, as a result of a high number of generalist species, interaction evenness was significantly lower, indicating less uniformity in interaction frequencies compared to control sites. Interaction turnover was high, driven by differences in the composition of plants and insects between sites. Our results demonstrate that pollinating insects do reestablish interactions with herbaceous species, enabling their interaction with later flowering target plants in the most advanced stages of restoration. These results should be taken into consideration when proposing measures to attract and retain pollinators in areas under restoration.

TI  - Walking on their own legs: unassisted population growth of the agouti Dasyprocta leporina, reintroduced to restore seed dispersal in an Atlantic Forest reserve
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Reintroduction of locally extirpated species is an increasingly popular conservation tool. However, few initiatives focus on the restoration of ecological processes. In addition, many reintroductions fail to conduct post-release monitoring, hampering both assessment of their success and implementation of adaptive management actions. In 2009 a reintroduction effort was initiated to re-establish a population of the red-rumped agouti Dasyprocta leporina, a scatter-hoarding rodent known to be an important disperser of large seeds, with the aim of restoring ecological processes at Tijuca National Park, south-east Brazil. To assess whether this reintroduced population established successfully we monitored it using mark-resighting during November 2013-March 2015. Population size and survival were estimated using a robust design Poisson-log normal mixed-effects mark-resight model. By March 2015 the number of wild-born individuals fluctuated around 30 and overall growth of the population was positive. As the reintroduced population is capable of unassisted growth, we conclude that the reintroduction has been successful in the medium term. We recommend the cessation of releases, with efforts redirected to continued monitoring, investigation and management of possible threats to the species' persistence, and to quantification of the re-establishment of ecological processes. Reintroduction of D. leporina populations can be a cost-effective tool to restore ecological processes, especially seed dispersal, in Neotropical forests.

TI  - Bayesian Decision-Network Modeling of Multiple Stakeholders for Reef Ecosystem Restoration in the Coral Triangle
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proposals for marine conservation measures have proliferated in the last 2 decades due to increased reports of fishery declines and interest in conservation. Fishers and fisheries managers have often disagreed strongly when discussing controls on fisheries. In such situations, ecosystem-based models and fisheries-stock assessment models can help resolve disagreements by highlighting the trade-offs that would be made under alternative management scenarios. We extended the analytical framework for modeling such trade-offs by including additional stakeholders whose livelihoods and the value they place on conservation depend on the condition of the marine ecosystem. To do so, we used Bayesian decision-network models (BDNs) in a case study of an Indonesian coral reef fishery. Our model included interests of the fishers and fishery managers; individuals in the tourism industry; conservation interests of the state, nongovernmental organizations, and the local public; and uncertainties in ecosystem status, projections of fisheries revenues, tourism growth, and levels of interest in conservation. We calculated the total utility (i.e., value) of a range of restoration scenarios. Restricting net fisheries and live-fish fisheries appeared to be the best compromise solutions under several combinations of settings of modeled variables. Results of our case study highlight the implications of alternate formulations for coral reef stakeholder utility functions and discount rates for the calculation of the net benefits of alternative fisheries management options. This case study may also serve as a useful example for other decision analyses with multiple stakeholders.

TI  - Peatland restoration as an affordable nature-based climate solution with fire reduction and conservation co-benefits in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is increasingly employed as a nature-based solution to a range of crises. Decisions over restoration must balance limited resources, land constraints, and competing demands. Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been heavily impacted by agricultural expansion over the past three decades, with Indonesia now accounting for a substantial proportion of degraded tropical peatlands globally. Using spatial linear programming, we focus on prioritizing peatland restoration sites in Indonesia for fire risk reduction, climate change mitigation, species conservation, and cost-effectiveness. The study finds that restoring peatlands at 1 km(2) planning units can generate multiple co-benefits such as reduced fire risks by 6%-37%, attenuated extinction risks of peatland specialist bird species and mitigated climate change potential of 0.002-0.36 Pg CO(2)e yr(-1). These benefits were reduced but still of comparable magnitude when larger areas of planning (defined by village and catchment boundaries) were used. The results, although indicative, support tropical peatland restoration as a cost-efficient strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing fire, conserving biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development that can be offset by carbon prices of USD 2-37/Mg CO(2)e.

AB  - Cytological study of Aegiphila sellowiana, Vitex montevidensis and Citharexylum myrianthum from Tibagi River Basin, Parana, Brazil. Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae are the main families in order Lamiales distributed in all tropical and temperate regions of the world. In this study, cytological comparisons were made between Aegiphila sellowiana Chamisso, Vitex montevidensis Chamisso and Citharexylum myrianthum Chamisso, collected in different areas of Tibagi River Basin, of Parana State, Brazil. Results showed that A. sellowiana presents 2n = 42 chromosomes, larger than those of V montevidensis (2n = 34) and of C. myrianthum (2n = ca. 104), which presents the smallest. The three analyzed species presented interphase nuclei of an arreticulate to semi-reticulate type and a proximal pattern of prophase condensation, without intraspecific variation or interspecific differences. Our results indicate that, from a cytological point of view (based on their chromosome numbers and size), individuals of these three species can be correctly identified and their seeds safely used for environmental restoration programs in the Tibagi River Basin.

TI  - Criteria to indicate priority species for the restoration of cerrado vegetation
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the attributes of the most suitable species to overcome the obstacles in different environmental conditions is an important tool for ecological restoration. To evaluate the comparative performance of native Cerrado species being cultivated at an arboretum (Assis State Forest, Assis, SP, Brazil), we categorized 106 species by the following attributes: average annual increment in height and crown diameter, survival rates, frequency of herbivory, frost susceptibility and seed dispersal syndrome. The score of each attribute may vary from 1 to 3, and the value of a species for restoration was generated from the sum of the scores for the different attributes converted to the scale of 0 to 100. Analyzing the species altogether, survival was 70%, the average annual increment was 30 cm in height and 21 cm in crown diameter. Only 8% of the species showed high susceptibility to frost and 17% high frequency of herbivory. Eighteen species had scores above 80, being the first Annona crassiflora, Cecropia pachystachya, Enterolobium gummiferum, Plathymenia reticulata e Protium heptaphyllum. In this group are the species that gather the highest number of favorable attributes for the restoration of Cerrado vegetation. We generated two separate lists of ten species of higher value, one for the cerrado sensu stricto and the other for cerradao the forest type of cerrado vegetation. We believe that using these species accelerates the recovery of vegetation structure and thus provide the restoration of ecological processes of ecosystems undergoing restoration. At the end of the list are species of low scores, which, if used, can lead to higher costs or delay in the recovery of structure and ecological processes of the ecosystem being restored.

TI  - Effect of artificial perches and the avifauna involved in the ecological restoration of a mined area in the south of Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzed the effect of artificial perches in the supply of vegetal propagules and in the avifauna attraction in degraded area due to mining, in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. The seed rain was sampled monthly from December, 2014 to April, 2015, in four collector tables arranged under artificial perches and in four control collector tables (without perches). We compared the seeds number by the Mann-Whitney U test (5% probability level) and used the Spearman correlation to calculate the association degree among the visitor birds on perches and the seeds number sampled in the collectors under perches. The avifauna monitoring was performed during the same period by fixed point method, totalizing 40 hours of sampled effort. The treatments differed statistically, with registration of 1588 seeds in the tables under perches and 237 seeds in the tables without perches. The sampling of seed rain in the perches followed the pattern of avifauna visitation, presenting high value to coefficient of association degree (0.975). We observed nine species of birds in the study area, and the Tyrannidae family was predominant. The species observed visiting the artificial perches were Knipolegus lophotes and Tyrannus melancholicus, both from Tyrannidae family. The number of sampled seeds demonstrates that artificial perches were efficient to return seed rain in the mined areas. The Tyrannidae family demonstrates to be the most effective group of birds to dispersion of seeds in the local of study.

TI  - Role of the propagule bank in reestablishing submerged macrophytes after removal of free-floating plants for recovery of a shallow lake in Southern Brazil
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - At eutrophic shallow subtropical lakes, free-floating macrophytes can occupy the entire water surface. The removal of this vegetation favors the recolonization of submerged macrophytes from the propagule bank. Our study presents the response of the propagule bank of a shallow subtropical lake after management to reduce its hypertrophy. We sampled lake sediment in March 2016 at 15 points along three transects to investigate the richness and density of the propagule bank by emergence in the laboratory. We monitored water trophic conditions and restoration of vegetation in the field for 7 months. In the laboratory, 1382 seedlings of eight species emerged. Stuckenia pectinata and Chara zeylanica dominated the propagule bank. We identified the species S. pectinata, C. zeylanica and Ludwigia peploides in the field. The propagule bank was homogeneous, without difference (P>0.05) between lake regions and transects. Sorensen's similarity was 36% between the field and laboratory. When the submerged macrophytes grew in the field, there was a reduction of chlorophyll -a, the water remained clear, and the trophic state index was reduced from hypereutrophic to eutrophic. We concluded that the bank of propagules in shallow lakes is essential for the rapid reestablishment of submerged macrophytes after recovery strategies. These organisms help improve water quality.

TI  - Land Use, Land Cover Change and Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture and Livestock in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy.

TI  - Floristic and functional identity of rupestrian grasslands as a subsidy for environmental restoration and policy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique vegetation of rupestrian grassland (Campo Rupestre) is finely tuned to the strong environmental and edaphoclimatic filters that resulted in important adaptations and high levels of endemism. In this study, we intend to give another focus to the understanding of the identity of the rupestrian grasslands by observing their floristic relationships with other surrounding vegetation types and to present for the first time a functional approach and zeta similarity to try to understand the differences and similarities of this ecosystem with other adjacent ones. We have compiled 1790 plant species in 7 vegetation types. Based on the species composition, we can infer that the most similar vegetation types were Tepuis and Altitudinal Grasslands, and this group is closer to Inselbergs. Subsequently, the most similar were Ironstone Grasslands and the Atlantic Forest grouped with Quartzite Grasslands. Finally, Cerrado was the lesser similar. But, these groupings are modified when analyzed at genus or family level. Considering the zeta diversity decline at the species level, the vegetation types showed an almost complete turnover in species assemblage, sharing only a small suite of species between them. This pattern is similar at the genus level, but the number of genera shared across vegetation types is comparatively higher. On the other hand, at the family level, there is a common core of families shared between vegetation types. When we evaluated the similarity considering functional attributes we found differences in composition regarding growth and life forms. However, in this case, Quartzitic and Ironstone Rupestrian Grasslands showed very similar functional attributes. They are inhabited by plant species with shrub, epiphytic, parasitic and succulent forms with rupicolous growth form. In general, the quartzitic grasslands have singular vegetation, but its affinity with other vegetation types does not translate in any way the most relevant aspects associated with endemism and biodiversity. The true landscape identity to a certain ecosystem is given by functional characteristics.

T2  - Acta Amazonica
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates patterns of forest structure and tree species diversity in an anthropogenic palm grove and undisturbed areas at the seasonally-dry Pinkaiti research station, in the Kayapo Indigenous Area. This site, managed by the Conservation International do Brasil, is the most southeastern site floristically surveyed in the Amazon until now The secondary and a nearby undisturbed forest were sampled in a group of 52 floristic plots of 0.0625-ha (25x25-m) where all trees with DBH 10 cm were measured and identified. The analyses were complemented with other two floristic plots of 1-ha (10x1000m). The present study has shown that the Pinkaiti, like other seasonally-dry forests, have great heterogeneity in forest structure and composition, associated with biotic characteristics of the most important tree species, natural disturbance and history of land-use. The palm grove, moderately dominated by the arborescent palm Attalea maripa (Aubl.) Mart., presented high tree species diversity and was floristically similar to undisturbed forests at the study site. It is discussed the importance of large arborescent palms for the seasonally-dry Amazon forests regeneration.

TI  - Tree diversity mediates individual diet specialization of the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus)
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual diet specialization is commonly found in generalist species but has been little studied in folivore mammals. Empirical evidence shows that the diversity of food resources in the habitat affects the degree of this specialization, by influencing among-individual diet variation (diet similarity) and individual niche breadth (diet diversity). We aim to evaluate the diet composition and selection of maned sloths (Bradypus torquatus, Illiger 1811) in two distinct ecological contexts; test whether the diet similarity between individuals and populations is explained by changes in the local floristic compositions and/or by a differentiated selection of tree species, and evaluate the effect of the local tree diversity on the diet diversity and similarity across individuals. We monitored 13 individuals in northern Bahia and Rio de Janeiro and accessed the tree species diversity and availability within each home range. We identified 67 tree species consumed, most of which were consumed in higher proportion than their availability in the home ranges, indicating high selectivity by the individuals. Diet similarity decreased with greater differences in the local floristic composition and higher tree diversity, but was also influenced by individual selection. Together, our results evidence that the maned sloth is specialist and selective at the individual level, and the lower tree diversity reduces individual diet specialization, revealing tree species that are commonly preferred at the population level under such condition. Our results can be directly applied to feeding protocols of captive populations, and ecological restoration initiatives focusing on the conservation of this threatened species.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of endozoochory by cattle in subtropical grassland in southern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed dispersal influences plant community dynamics and regeneration. Zoochory by cattle is a particularly important type of dispersal in grasslands, but still poorly understood in subtropical grasslands. We studied endozoochory in a native grassland area with different grazing intensities, defined by distinct forage allowance levels. On one day in each of the four seasons of the year, dung samples were collected and kept in a greenhouse for germination over one full year. At each dung collection date, a survey of reproducing plants was conducted to relate the species composition of seed within dung to the community in dispersal phase. We used randomisation tests to compare grazing intensities and seasons in terms of dung community richness, abundance and composition. We recorded 93 species in the dung samples, with 65 species in the spring samples, 61 in summer samples, 45 in the autumn samples and 37 in the winter samples. Of the 90 species identified in the vegetation, almost 50% (43 species) also occurred in dung samples. Graminoid herbs presented the largest number of species in all samples. Grazing had no effect on overall seed and species number, but was related to compositional differences in the cattle dung communities. Grazing also influenced the species composition in relation to life cycle, by the increase of annual species at the extremes of our grazing gradient (very high or very low grazing intensities). We conclude that endozoochory by cattle is an important process for the dispersal of native species in the studied system, with potential applications in grassland management and restoration. A better understanding of the strategies involved in seed dispersal is essential to improve knowledge about grassland vegetation regeneration and maintenance.

TI  - Inoculum origin and soil legacy can shape plant-soil feedback outcomes for tropical grassland restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration techniques tailored to grasslands are needed to improve the effectiveness of restoration in tropical landscapes. In this study, we investigated the joint effects of plant-soil legacies and soil inocula in native and invaded Cerrado grasslands to evaluate whether different microbial origins affect plant-soil feedbacks and the likelihood of restoration. Using two grass species, we measured aboveground biomass, and several plant traits over two growth cycles. Species responded differently to inocula and legacies. The legacy of the invasive Urochloa eminii and invaded soil inocula positively affected mycorrhizal colonization. The legacy of Diectomis fastigiata, a commonly used species in Cerrado restoration, resulted in a negative self-feedback potentially limiting its effectiveness for restoration. The success of the invasive species was in part due to its broad ecological niche and its ability to cope with a broad range of soil conditions. Our research suggests soil inocula and legacies could be used to aid restoration efforts in the tropics, allowing restoration practitioners to stimulate the growth of species targeting functional traits for a given ecosystem.

TI  - Phytosociological study to define restoration measures in a mined area in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we describe a case study to evaluate the floristic diversity and the soil conditions of post mined area, currently under 14-years of restoration. The study area is located in the municipality of Descoberto, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and has one hectare in the process of restoration through the planting of seedlings. The forest inventory of all individuals with Circumference at Breast Height (CBH) >= 15 cm was carried out and the phytosociological parameters were evaluated. The study area shows a high floristic diversity H' = 3.258 as well as equability (J' = 0.783), evidencing that the study area is floristically heterogeneous and has low ecological dominance. In addition, this area presented floristic similarity to other restored areas that were already in a more advanced restoration process. Considering soil quality, the restored study area shows higher levels of cation exchange capacity (t), approximate sum base values (SB) and base saturation (V) than those verified in nearby areas. Evaluating the successional characteristics (greater presence of individuals of secondary succession) and the domain of species with dispersion by animals, we can infer that the area is in an advanced stage of restoration, as well as performing its environmental and social functions. Thus, we can conclude that the restoration of mined areas is feasible when the restoration techniques are applied correctly. Furthermore, we can say that these successful restoration measures are improving the environmental sustainability and helping considerably the recovery of losses caused by mining.

T2  - BOTANICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The research was conducted between March 2013 and July 2014 in preservation areas that protect water resources in the Andreas Stream Basin, RS, and aimed to evaluate the phytosociological structure of these areas, which were established through the Payment for Environmental Services (PES). A total of 83 species, distributed in 72 genera and 34 families were recorded in twenty sampling points. The results of the cluster analysis indicate the occurrence of five groups based on the averages of the Importance Value Index (IVI), highlighting Group 1 that showed the highest average and significant differences (p < 0.05) compared to the other groups, being them: Allophylus edulis (A. St.-Hill., Cambess. & A. J.) R, Casearia silvestres SW, Cupania vernalis Cambess, Inga marginata Willd, Matayba elaeagnoides Radlk. and Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez. These species are recommended for restoration in preservation areas that were degraded, highlighting that PES is highly efficient in terms of sustainability.

TI  - Monitoring immediate post-fire vegetation dynamics of tropical mountain grasslands using phenocameras
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing incidence of uncontrolled wildfires all over the globe has called for urgent close monitoring of fire events, awareness, prevention, and management approaches. Phenocameras, ground sensors for monitoring plant phenology by taking sequential RGB digital images, can be an accessible and accurate tool for identifying, monitoring, and analyzing fire events and vegetation recovery. Here, we evaluated the application of an RGB camera system as a methodological approach to monitor and assess the post-fire recovery of a tropical mountain grasslands, the Brazilian campo rupestre. Using camera-derived vegetation indices, we investigated the immediate post-fire regrowth, and short-term post-fire leafing among four vegetation types: wet grassland, peatbog, stony grassland, and rocky outcrop. We recorded significant variations in the post-fire recovery among the grassy vegetation types. The results indicated that fire represents an important driver of leafing dynamics by shortening the length of post-fire growing seasons. The phenological metric of growing season length (GSL) indicated a full post-fire ecosystem recovery in the third year after the fire. The green-up index represented well the dynamics of post-fire vegetation regrowth and recovery across the landscape. Phenocameras rapidly detected fire occurrence and post-fire vegetation responses across vegetation types, demonstrating their significant application in the fire ecology of grassy ecosystems. The accessible, low-cost, and easy-to-setup camera system allows the application of near-remote phenology as a monitoring system and an indicator of vegetation recovery, which may improve restoration and management plans, promoting the conservation of the highly diverse campo rupestre grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Savannas after afforestation: Assessment of herbaceous community responses to wildfire versus native tree planting
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation and fire exclusion are pervasive threats to tropical savannas. In Brazil, laws limiting prescribed burning hinder the study of fire in the restoration of Cerrado plant communities. We took advantage of a 2017 wildfire to evaluate the potential for tree cutting and fire to promote the passive restoration of savanna herbaceous plant communities after destruction by exotic tree plantations. We sampled a burned pine plantation (Burned Plantation); a former plantation that was harvested and burned (Harvested & Burned); an unburned former plantation that was harvested, planted with native trees, and treated with herbicide to control invasive grasses (Native Tree Planting); and two old-growth savannas which served as reference communities. Our results confirm that herbaceous plant communities on post-afforestation sites are very different from old-growth savannas. Among post-afforestation sites, Harvested & Burned herbaceous communities were modestly more similar in composition to old-growth savannas, had slightly higher richness of savanna plants (3.8 species per 50-m(2)), and supported the greatest cover of native herbaceous plants (56%). These positive trends in herbaceous community recovery would be missed in assessments of tree cover: whereas canopy cover in the Harvested & Burned site was 6% (less than typical of savannas of the Cerrado), the Burned Plantation and Native Tree Planting supported 34% and 19% cover, respectively. By focusing on savanna herbaceous plants, these results highlight that tree cutting and fire, not simply tree planting and fire exclusion, should receive greater attention in efforts to restore savannas of the Cerrado.

TI  - Flipped reducetarianism: A vegan fish subordinated to carnivory by suppression of the flooded forest in the Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of dams closure and floodplain forest removal on diet and body condition of a frugivorous migratory fish from the Amazon were evaluated herein. Fish were captured with gillnets in two different environmental conditions: before and after the construction of the Santo Antonio reservoir in Madeira River, preceded by clearing of floodplain forest to mitigate the effects of eutrophication into the run-of-river dam. A total of 493 Mylossoma duriventre specimens were accessed and showed a strong shift in diet while body condition did not change after reservoir formation. The vegan diet based on fruits and seed was associated to Mylossoma duriventre prior to damming, and replaced by a carnivorous one, mainly based on insects. Our results suggest that dietary plasticity has guaranteed its body condition, at least in the first two years after damming. Cutting off floodplain forest to avoid eutrophication has immediate and direct impacts upon the supply of fruits and seeds for Mylossoma duriventre. Still, substitution with insectivorous diet over a frugivorous one, as observed for Mylossoma duriventre, may conceal an underlying problem of decreasing the local ichthyochory and floodplain forest maintenance or restoration of varzea areas over the time.

T2  - ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate Syagrus romanzoffiana (Arecaceae) (1) reproductive phenology, (2) seed dispersal and (3) seed predation in a highly fragmented landscape. Over a 24-month period, we recorded flowering and fruiting events, proportions of fallen fruit infested by insects, as well as seed dispersal and seed predation by squirrels. Overall flowering and fruiting intensities varied among months; flowering being significantly greater in January and March 2008, and fruiting in April June and August September 2008. There were no differences between the first and second years in the flowering and fruiting percentages, flowering and fruiting duration, their peaks or synchrony. The squirrels spent same amounts of time dispersing and eating the seeds. Additionally, there were no statistical differences among the fragments in the numbers of squirrel visits, seeds dispersed or eaten by squirrels, or in the time spent by squirrels on eating or dispersing the seeds. Seed predation rates by insects or percentage of fruits with eggs were not influenced by fruit density, size or weight. Syagrus romanzoffiana can be characterized as a robust secondary species, recommended for restoration programs in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Genetic variability of Spondias lutea L. in a population located in the Lower San Francisco, Sergipe State, by isozyme markers
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge about the reproduction system, its structure and genetic diversity are necessary for the genetic conservation of a species. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity in a Spondias lutea L. population located in the Lower San Francisco River, Sergipe State, by isozyme markers; in order to allow elaborating strategies for seed production to restore a riparian forest. For this, young leaves of 16 individuals of Spondias lutea L. were collected and analysed. The genetic diversity was obtained from the allelic frequencies estimates ((P) over cap (ij)) and the diversity indexes (average observed heterozigosity ((H) over cap (0)); average expected heterozigosity ((H) over cap (e)); average number of alleles per locus ((A) over cap) and polymorphic loci percentage). Also the Wright index was determined. Of 28 detected alleles, 12 (42.85 %) appear in low frequency. The polymorphic loci percentage was 90 % and the number of alleles for locus was 2.80. The observed average heterozigosity was higher than expected by Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. This can be better visualized by the Wright Index ((F) over cap ((IS)) = -0,0658). Due to the high polymorphism, the studied population has a good potential for in situ conservation.

TI  - Spectral trend of vegetation with rainfall in events of El Nino-Southern Oscillation for Atlantic Forest biome, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectral trend of vegetation with rainfall in El Nino-Southern Oscillation events (ENSO) in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Monthly rainfall data were collected from 85 conventional meteorological stations (EMC), data from the Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) and ENSO events (El Nino, La Nina, and Neutral) in the period from 2001 to 2013. Afterwards, state cluster analysis was performed using the results of non-parametric tests. The Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test did not identify a trend pattern in rainfall distribution in the Atlantic Forest. The results for EVI2 by state and region showed that the trend is decreasing in the Northeast Region, except for the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Southeast region showed an increasing trend of EVI2 (except for Rio de Janeiro and SAo Paulo), while the South region showed a decreasing trend. In the Midwest, the trend was significantly decreasing. In the prognosis elaborated for the future, the regions with significant declines of the vegetation were the Northeast and Midwest. This study shows that the Atlantic Forest in some regions of Brazil has been suffering from the growing urbanization process and there is a trend of soil degradation.

TI  - Benefits of tropical peatland rewetting for subsidence reduction and forest regrowth: results from a large-scale restoration trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage and deforestation of tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) in Southeast Asia cause carbon emissions and biodiversity loss of global concern. Restoration efforts to mitigate these impacts usually involve peatland rewetting by blocking canals. However, there have been no studies to date of the optimal rewetting approach that will reduce carbon emission whilst also promoting PSF regeneration. Here we present results of a large-scale restoration trial in Sumatra (Indonesia), monitored for 7.5 years. Water levels in a former plantation were raised over an area of 4800 ha by constructing 257 compacted peat dams in canals. We find peat surface subsidence rates in the rewetted restoration area and adjoining PSF to be halved where water tables were raised from similar to - 0.6 m to similar to - 0.3 m, demonstrating the success of rewetting in reducing carbon emission. A total of 57 native PSF tree species were found to spontaneously grow in the most rewetted conditions and in high densities, indicating that forest regrowth is underway. Based on our findings we propose that an effective PSF restoration strategy should follow stepwise rewetting to achieve substantial carbon emission reduction alongside unassisted regrowth of PSF, thereby enabling the peat, forest and canal vegetation to establish a new nature-based ecosystem balance.

TI  - Mortality of seedlings of native species under grazing effect of goats, sheep and emas: implications for restoration projects of degraded areas in the dry forest
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of herbivory by goats and sheep on seedlings used in a project to restore degraded areas in the Caatinga, in addition to presenting emas as an alternative to the problem. The experiment was carried out in 2,500 m(2) plots. Within each of these sample units, seedlings of Caatinga species were planted. The seedlings were monitored for a month to identify dead plants. With these data the mortality rate and the results compared between the animals were calculated. The average mortality rates were higher for the seedlings under the effect of grazing of goats and sheep. The rates ranged from 12-100% for the grazing under goat grazing, 32-100% sheep and 0-24% emas. Statistically, the mortality of grazing under goat and sheep grazing was higher than that caused by emas for most of the 10 species tested. The results obtained ratify the damaging effects of goats and sheep under the Caatinga flora and evidenced the difficulty of RAD with the presence of these animals. The emas were promising for creation in areas of RAD projects.

TI  - Mapping Forest Stability within Major Biomes Using Canopy Indices Derived from MODIS Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation from human land use, including primary forest loss, are of growing concern. The conservation of old-growth and other forests with important environmental values is central to many international initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Current remote-sensing products largely focus on deforestation rather than forest degradation and are dependent on machine learning, calibrated with extensive field measurements. To help address this, we developed a novel approach for mapping forest ecosystem stability, defined in terms of constancy, which is a key characteristic of long-undisturbed (including primary) forests. Our approach categorizes forests into stability classes based on satellite-data time series related to plant water-carbon relationships. Specifically, we used long-term dynamics of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPAR) and shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period 2003-2018. We calculated a set of variables from annual time series of fPAR and SIWSI for representative forest regions at opposite ends of Earth's climatic and latitudinal gradients: boreal forests of Siberia (southern taiga, Russia) and tropical rainforests of the Amazon basin (Kayapo territory, Brazil). Independent validation drew upon high-resolution Landsat imagery and forest cover change data. The results indicate that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable across forest biomes and, thereby, provides a timely and transferrable method to aid in the identification and conservation of stable forests. Information on the location of less stable forests is equally relevant for ecological restoration, reforestation, and proforestation activities.

TI  - A Multicriteria Evaluation of Sustainable Riparian Revegetation with Local Fruit Trees around a Reservoir of a Hydroelectric Power Plant in Central Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of hydropower plants often requires the flooding of large land areas, causing considerable alterations in the natural environment. In the region surrounding the reservoir of the Corumba IV hydroelectric plant, located in the Cerrado region of Central Brazil, two types of soil predominate, classified as Dystroferric Red Latosol and Dystroferric Haplic Cambisol. The plant owners have to restore the degraded biome after the flooding of the margins caused by the filling of the reservoir. An experiment was carried out with fifteen native species, selected for having ideal phytosociological properties. Nine of them showed a survivability considered satisfactory in a planting situation, with a view to large-scale planting. Assuming that the planting of native fruit trees can be a quick solution to the attraction and preservation of wildlife, it would therefore provide sustainable riparian revegetation around the reservoir. We adopted the SIMOS technique to rank the criteria based on four morphological features and a Fuzzy AHP model to rank the contributions of the nine fruit tree species to the sustainable restoration of part of the riparian vegetation cover around the reservoir. In practical terms, we concluded that the soil types did not have any influence on tree survival after two years of growth, but the native trees' morphological features varied among the species. These findings simplify the large-scale planting of seedlings that must be carried out by the operator in the riparian forest around the reservoir.

TI  - Point of (no) return? Vegetation structure and diversity of restored mangroves in Sulawesi, Indonesia, 14-16 years on
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, benefitting millions of people, experience significant degradation. Global recognition of the urgency of halting and reversing this trend have initiated numerous restoration activities. Restoration success is typically evaluated by estimating mangrove survival and area restored, while diversity and structure of vegetation, as proxies for functional forests, are rarely considered. Here we assess mangrove species richness along sea-landward transects and evaluate restoration outcomes by comparing number of mangrove species, relative species abundance, biomass, diameter, and canopy cover in "Monoculture Reforestation", "Mixed Species Regeneration" and adjacent "Reference" forest stands, 14 (Tiwoho site) and 16 years (Likupang site) after restoration activities took place. In the "Monoculture Reforestation" plots, mangrove diversity and structure still closely reflected the original restoration actions, with only one and two "new" species having established among the originally densely planted "foundation" species. In contrast, the "Mixed Species Regeneration" plots were more similar to the "Reference" plots in terms of tree diameter and canopy coverage, but species number, abundance and biomass were still lower. The trajectory of the "Mixed Species Regeneration" plots suggests their similarity with the "Reference" stands will increase over time, whereas such "smooth" transition is unlikely to happen in the planted "Monoculture Reforestation" stands, in the foreseeable future. Implementing frequent small-scale disturbances in restored forest management would increase stand structure and diversity, accelerating the establishment of a more natural, and likely more functional and resilient forest.

TI  - The cost of restoring carbon stocks in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10-60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$(-1), respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Fire danger assessment using geospatial modelling in Mekong delta, Vietnam: Effects on wetland resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam is a large tropical wetland important for commodity provision, water balance regulation, and biodiversity conservation. However, the delta is under severe fire risk due to prolonged drought and rising temperatures largely emanating from climatic change. Our study applied MODIS Terra land surface reflectance (MOD09A1), MODIS Terra land surface temperature (MOD11A2), and ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) to develop fire danger models to assess spatial patterns in fire danger in the MD. Four variables: Potential Surface Temperature (PST), Modified Normalized Difference Fire Index (MNDFI), Perpendicular Moisture Index (PMI) and Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), were extracted from the satellite products to develop the models using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and weighted overlay methods to generate fire danger maps during the 2019 fire season. The models were validated using MODIS Terra and Aqua thermal anomaly product (MOD14), with overall accuracy of 84.13%. The result demonstrated that the model accurately estimates fire risk over the MD. The study also found that forests, especially Melaleuca wetland forests in U Minh wetlands, and agricultural land were under severe fire risk. The implication is that measures such as proper management of forests and agricultural activities for mitigating forest fires and integrated fire and water strategies for either fire risk mitigation or biodiversity conservation are necessary for sustainable management of the MD wetland.

TI  - Effect of Site Attributes and Matrix Composition on Neotropical Primate Species Richness and Functional Traits: A Comparison Among Regions
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmentation threatens biodiversity and forest-dwelling animals can be especially vulnerable. Neotropical primates inhabit forests and play ecological roles in maintaining forest biodiversity. Currently, many primate communities are restricted to forest fragments. We (1) evaluated the influence of environmental, matrix, and site attributes on species richness and functional traits of primates in the Neotropics; and (2) evaluated the effect of the sub-region on the relationships between primates and environmental, matrix, and site attributes. We conducted literature searches to find published data on primate communities in forest fragments throughout the Neotropics. Each fragment was assigned to 1 of 11 sub-regions: Mesoamerica, Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena, Caribbean, Orinoco, Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Chaco, Andes, Caatinga, and Pampa. Based on actual and expected species occurrences, we calculated the proportion of primate species retained in the fragments, the mass retained, and dietary items retained considering reproductive and vegetative plant parts and prey. We used linear mixed models to correlate primate variables with environmental, matrix, and site attributes. Fragment area was more important for primate retention than environmental, matrix, and site attributes, with primate retention being higher in larger fragments. Fragment size was positively correlated with all primate variables, except for retention of prey consumption, whose retention decreased as water bodies and density of buildings in the matrix increased. Fragments within protected areas retained larger species than unprotected fragments. The proportion of extant mass retained and vegetative plant parts in the diet were highest in Mesoamerica and lowest in the Atlantic Forest. Conservation planning of Neotropical primates should consider both the differences among sub-regions, forest restoration to increase fragment size, and the creation of new protected areas, even in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN VEGETATION TYPES IN THE PANTANAL OF NHECOLANDIA, MATO GROSSO DO SUL, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal (tropical wetland) biome is recognized as one of the largest continuous areas of natural wetlands, harboring a flora and fauna of rare beauty and abundance. Studies to assess the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are nonexistent for this environment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of AMF in different vegetation types of the Pantanal of Nhecolandia, Brazil. Soil samples were collected during the dry and wet season in a Neossolo Quartzarenico (Entisol) in vegetation types subject to different flooding regimes: flood-free - semi-deciduous forest (FS) and "Cerradao" (CE); subject to occasional flooding - grassland dominated by Elyonurus muticus (CLE) and "Cerrado" (CC); and subject to seasonal flooding - grasslands dominated by Andropogon spp. (CLA), the edge of bays (BB), and areas exposed at low water/lowlands (VB). Trap crops were established with Brachiaria brizantha to recover cryptic AMF species. Chemical analyses and spore extraction were carried for each soil sample to identify AMF species and determine their abundance and richness. A total of 37 AMF species, belonging to 10 genera and six families, were detected for both seasons. Spore numbers varied significantly among vegetation types, and the highest values were found in CE and CLA. The greatest richness of species was detected in CC (25 species), followed by VB, with 22 species, and CE, with 21 species. This is the first report on AMF diversity from the Pantanal biome. Results of this study suggest that AMF diversity is related to the heterogeneity among vegetation types and that soil chemical characteristics influence the structure of these fungi communities. Considering that the Pantanal is one of the most conserved biomes in the world, the survey of the occurrence of AMF in this study provides important information for better understanding the biodiversity of the phytophysiognomies of this biome.

TI  - Eciton Army Ants-Umbrella Species for Conservation in Neotropical Forests
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for the maintenance and protection of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where biodiversity continues to be lost at alarming rates. Surveys and research on umbrella species can provide efficient and effective approaches to identify potential areas for conservation at small geographical scales. Army ants of the genus Eciton are keystone species in neotropical forests due to their major role as top predators and due to the numerous vertebrate- and invertebrate associated species that depend upon their colonies for survival. These associates range from the iconic army ant-following birds to a wide range of arthropod groups, some of which have evolved intricate morphological, behavioural and/or chemical strategies to conceal their presence and integrate into the colony life. Furthermore, Eciton colonies require large forested areas that support a diverse leaf litter prey community and several field-based and genetic studies have demonstrated the negative consequences of forest fragmentation for the long-term maintenance of these colonies. Therefore, Eciton species will not only act as umbrella for their associates but also for many other species in neotropical forests, in particular for those that require a large extent of forest. This review summarises past and recent accounts of the main taxonomic groups found associated with Eciton colonies, as well research assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on this army ant, to encourage the adoption of Eciton army ants as umbrella species for the identification of priority areas for conservation and assessments of the effect of disturbance in neotropical forests.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Trends and Future Directions of Research and Development of Seed Orchards
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seed orchards are important seed resources for producing improved tree crops for future plantations, forest restoration, and forestry practices (i.e., gene conservation) and for transmitting current gene diversity to future generations. Seed orchards are a major sub-division in forest science. The establishment and management of a seed orchard involves many steps, from the selection of superior trees to the harvesting of a seed crop. Studying the trends and future directions of seed orchards using different analysis methods is critically important, especially to establish resistant forests via the production of climate-smart, biotic/abiotic-stress-resistant seedling materials. Published papers related to seed orchards should be analyzed to determine the current trends in this field and to contribute to its future directions. Bibliometric analysis has been used for different purposes in various scientific fields. However, it has not been performed for publications in seed orchards. This study was carried out to analyze the current trends of research on seed orchards and to determine the future directions of these orchards based on published papers. For these purposes, 1018 published papers were obtained from the Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, and citation index databases of "Web of Science" using the keyword "seed orchard". The papers were published between 1980 and 2022 and were subjected to bibliometric analysis based on the most prolific contributors, references, countries, and keywords. CiteSpace software 6.1 R6 was applied to visualize information about seed orchard research. The average number of citations per publication was 13.05, and the 4 H-Index of the publication set was 48. The most prolific contributors with the strongest citation bursts, the highest centrality, and the greatest numbers of published papers were from Canada, Sweden, South Korea, Finland, and Czech Republic, while Canada (186 published articles), the USA (140), and Sweden (115), together with China, Brazil, and Germany, were active countries, especially based on citations from recent years. The "keywords" of the papers were the core of the research. "Mating pattern", "Swedish forestry", "fertility variation", "Hymenoscyphus fraxineus", "threatened Pacific sandalwood", "outbreeding depression", "climate change", "management", and "growth", together with others such as "genetic improvement" and "effective size", were active study areas and keywords, based on results of the analysis. They also guided the literature search and inventory and classification of early studies and served as predictors for future studies. The results of this study are discussed based on the trends and future directions of the research and development of seed orchards.

TI  - Species-specific performance and trade-off between growth and survival in the early-successional light-demanding group
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated if high irradiance imposes stress conditions and differently affects the performance of species from the early-successional light-demanding group and if the costs associated with plasticity underlie the trade-off between growth and survival. Survival, growth, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and carbon stable isotopic ratio (delta C-13) were measured in seedlings of four tree species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest under full-sun exposure and partial shading treatments. The maximal quantum yield of PSII indicated stress conditions mainly in the full-sun exposure treatment (values from 0.72 to 0.81). The delta C-13 ranged from -31.9 to -30.4 parts per thousand, but did not differ between treatments for three species, suggesting that C assimilation in initial restoration conditions is stressful even in shade. The survival scaled negatively with growth and plasticity adjustments. We conclude that early-successional species do not form a homogenous species group because they differ in functional responses to stress, and phenotypic plasticity, with these variations showing a strong link with the trade-off between growth and survival. This information should be taken into account for species selection in restoration programs.

TI  - A Holistic Review of Lake Rawapening Management Practices, Indonesia: Pillar-Based and Object-Based Management
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lake Rawapening, Semarang Regency, Indonesia, has incorporated a holistic plan in its management practices. However, despite successful target achievements, some limitations remain, and a review of its management plan is needed. This paper identifies and analyzes existing lake management strategies as a standard specifically in Lake Rawapening by exploring various literature, both legal frameworks and scholarly articles indexed in the Scopus database and Google Scholar about lake management in many countries. By using Publish or Perish with the keywords "lake management" OR "management of lake", 1532 and 1990 works from the Scopus database and Google Scholar, respectively, have been reduced 37. The results show that there are two major types of lake management, namely pillar-based and object-based. The holistic review has resulted in nine points of pillar-based management, which consists of conceptual paradigms as the foundation, and 11 points of object-based management to restore or preserve the lake, which is in line with the form of programs and activities. Overall, Lake Rawapening management should be concerned with finance and technology when applying pillar-based management, and it should include more activities within programs on erosion-sedimentation control as well as monitoring of operational performance using information systems to ensure the implementation of activities within programs in applying object-based lake management.

TI  - Propagule predation in a Neotropical mangrove: the role of the Grapsid crab Goniopsis cruentata
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Neotropical mangroves the crabs Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata have been considered the most significant propagule consumers, but their relative importance has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude of predation by these crabs on three mangrove species propagules: Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle. We found that G. cruentata is a more important predator than U. cordatus in both natural and restored areas. We also tested the hypothesis that Ucides and Goniopsis have antagonistic effects on propagules predation using a cage experiment where the presence/absence of these species was manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The effects of Goniopsis were stronger in the absence of Ucides due to negative interactions between these predator species. Moreover, we found that Goniopsis preference for A. schaueriana and L. racemosa can favor the dominance of R. mangle in Neotropical mangroves. This study suggests that propagule predation by Goniopsis should be controlled in mangrove restoration programs at abandoned shrimp farms and destroyed areas, if dominance by R. mangle is undesirable relative to mixed species communities.

TI  - Effect of conversion from sugarcane preharvest burning to residues green trashing on SOC stocks and soil fertility status: Results from different soil conditions in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land management have a recognized impact on the cycle of elements such as carbon and nitrogen and are thus expected to play an important role in the mitigation against human-induced environmental changes such as global warming. Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years, experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning (B) to mechanized green-trashing (GT), whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain. This study performed in the Sao-Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, investigated the impact of shifting from B to GT on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks, and chemical elements at three 4-year and one 12-year old trial sites. Soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types (clayey to sandy-clay Hapludox; Hapudult and sandy Quartzpsamment). Sampling was up to 0.4 m (0-0.05; 0.05-0.1; 0.1-0.2; 0.2-0.4 m) depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots (of 0.2 ha size each) per treatment arranged in randomized block design. The samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH and chemical concentrations. Overall, conversion from B to GT increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 12.8-13.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 0.4 m soil layer by 1.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.11 Mg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The highest carbon sequestration rate (108%o y(-1)) occurred in the most carbon depleted soils, which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. All the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration, especially within the topmost soil layer, because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together. Considering the average sequestration rate of 1.06 ton ha-1 y(-1), the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for Brazil where 8.8 million hectares are under green-trashing of sugarcane residues would be 9.3 million ton C y(-1). However, intermittent tillage every 4-5 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration, suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage. There is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to fmd sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses.

TI  - Is the forest moratorium merely a mirage? A case study on the effectiveness of the forest moratorium in Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Current national policies emphasize the vital role of forestry and land use in meeting emission reduction targets. The forest moratorium aims to reduce emissions by protecting primary forests and peatlands from deforestation and degradation. While the forest moratorium has been in place for a decade, empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness is limited. This study seeks to analyze the effectiveness of the forest moratorium, with Riau Province serving as a case study. Data collection methods encompassed in-depth interviews with key informants and multi-stakeholder focused group discussions (FGDs). The effectiveness of the forest moratorium is evaluated across three primary dimensions: new permitting, deforestation rates and governance improvements. The results show that the forest moratorium in Riau has not been very effective. Out of 4.2 M ha of remaining forest area only 1.2 M ha is forested, and deforestation continues. Pressure on forests remains high mainly for oil palm expansion. The ever-changing forest moratorium map and weak regulations have created loopholes that allow certain areas to be excluded from the moratorium and consequently issue new licenses. In addition, strengthening the One Map policy as a unified database agreed upon by institutions is essential to improve the effectiveness of the forest moratorium.

TI  - Optimizing seeding density of fast-growing native trees for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding is a promising method for reducing restoration costs, but methodological adjustments are still needed to reduce the uncertainties to achieve a desired seedling density in the field. Here, we investigated the technical approaches and outcomes of direct seeding of fast-growing native trees for cost-effective restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Sixteen tree species were manually sown at three seeding densities in planting lines prepared with a subsoiler, in two experimental areas, which were weeded with hoes and had leaf-cutter ants controlled with insecticide baits. Seedling density was monitored for 30, 90, and 180 days after sowing. No substantial change in tree density was observed 30 days after sowing, thus allowing fast corrective actions to adjust tree density. Only a minor proportion of the sown viable seeds resulted in established seedlings at 180 days (4-12% for the community; approximately 25% for the species with the best performance). However, tree density was high (6,000 on average; approximately 1,400-13,000 trees/ha) and allowed an effective canopy development. Overall, seedling density was linearly and positively associated with seeding density, was highly influenced by the species used, and was higher in the soil with higher sum of bases. Buying seeds would be, for most species, less costly than buying nursery-grown seedlings for achieving the expected tree densities in the field. These results evidence the potential of direct seeding for reducing restoration costs, as well as the need to select species with better performance and adjust seeding densities to optimize the use of this method.

TI  - Diaspore Removal by Ants Does Not Reflect the Same Patterns of Ant Assemblages in Mining and Rehabilitation Areas
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining is responsible for drastic ecosystem changes and rehabilitation is used to promote the return of functions after these impacts. In this scenario, we investigated the responses of ant assemblages and diaspore removal by ants to the transformations caused by mining and rehabilitation predicting that (a) the increase in plant density (a proxy for mining intensity) led to an increase in ant richness, percentage of diaspores removed, and changes in species composition that in turn are correlated with changes in environmental variables; (b) the increase in vegetation structure (a proxy for rehabilitation ages) led to an increase in ant richness, percentage of diaspores removed, and changes in species composition that in turn are correlated with changes in environmental variables. Additionally, we also verified which functional groups were primarily responsible for diaspore removal. We sampled arboreal and epigeic ants, diaspore removal by ants, and environmental variables. We found that ant richness and diaspore removal in mining intensity gradient are positively correlated to plant density. Although vegetation structure is positively correlated with ant richness, we found no changes in diaspore removal in rehabilitation gradient. Epigeic omnivore and epigeic generalist predator ants were the most responsible for diaspore removal. Then, we observed that mining decreases ant richness, altering ant assemblages and their functions, and rehabilitation with exotic plants is ineffective to promote the colonization by the main diaspore-removing ants.

TI  - Recovery of Atlantic Rainforest areas altered by distinct land-use histories in northeastern Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of anthropogenically disturbed sites contributes to biodiversity conservation, but pre-recovery land-use history affects the restoration and recovery time of impacted forest sites. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of different land-use histories (low-impact logging - LL, high-impact logging - HL, and slash-and-burn - SB) on quantitative (diversity values) and qualitative (floristic composition) measures of forest recovery. This research was conducted in Atlantic rainforest areas of Bahia State, Brazil, which had remained undisturbed for 50 to 60 years after human disturbance. Surprisingly, the area subjected to the most aggressive usage (SB) showed intermediate richness and diversity values, but had a floristic composition dominated by pioneer species similar to early-successional forests. Families typical of preserved areas (Sapotaceae and Myrtaceae) were more diverse in LL and HL areas. Our results indicate both quantitative and qualitative recovery in areas subjected to LL, which tended to recover without intervention. Areas subjected to HL showed intermediate qualitative recovery and the lowest quantitative recovery, and may therefore require enrichment to accelerate recovery. Despite good quantitative (species richness and diversity) recovery, the slash-and-burn areas had a predominance of early successional species, which indicates that enrichment actions are essential for the recovery of these forest areas. Knowledge of how land-use history influences forest restoration processes can guide management actions and thereby contribute to the allocation of resources where they are really needed.

TI  - GENETIC DIVERSITY AMONG INDIVIDUALS OF Spondias lutea L. ORIGINATING FROM SERGIPE LOW SAN FRANCISCO AREA USING RAPD MARKERS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of riparian forests with seedlings that have as much genetic diversity as possible is very important for the conservation of species. Thus, the objectives of this study were to characterize genetically, by RAPD markers, individuals of Spondias lutea L., and to elaborate strategies of seed production for restoration of riparian forest. The study was conducted in a riparian forest in the Low San Francisco area in Sergipe State, Brazil, where leaves of 17 individuals were collected for RAPD analysis. The DNA extraction was performed with CTAB 2% buffer and for the polymorphism generation 17 primers were used. We used a binary matrix constructed with presence (1) and absence (0) of bands in order to obtain the genetic similarity estimates. The simplified representation of the similarities was made by the UPGMA grouping method and stability of groupings was tested by bootstrap analysis. For the visualization of the divergence among individuals, we used the Tocher grouping method. The genetic distance matrix was compared with the matrix of geographical distance by Mantel's test, in order to determine whether a correlation exists between them. The mean genetic similarity between individuals was 46,8%, with the similarity coefficients ranging from 21 to 78%. There was no association between genetic and geographical distances (r = 0.08). Five groups were formed by the Tocher grouping method. The minimum value of calculated similarity was 91%. Thus, the analyzed individuals were considered divergent and can be used as tree-seeds in seed production programs to restore riparian forests.

TI  - Native tree seedling growth when fertilized with different amounts of dry sewage sludge and mineral fertilizer
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing volume of urban sewage nowadays generates considerable amount of sludge to be disposed of. One environmentally adequate destination could be the application of treated and stabilized sludge (biosolids) to forest plantations as fertilizer and soil conditioner. The purpose of this study was to analyze the feasibility of applying sewage sludge, evaluating its effects on native tree seedlings. The species evaluated were "aroeira-pimenteira" (Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi), "cabreuva-vermelha" (Myroxy-Ion peruiferum L. f.), "pau-de-viola" (Cytarexyllum myrianthum Cham), "unha-de-vaca" (Bauhinia forficata Link), which are usually planted in forest restoration. Seedlings were cultivated in pots, containing a volume of 4 dm(3) of soil, within a greenhouse. The study was developed in the proximity of Campinas, SP, Brazil, and installed in November, 2003. The design was entirely randomized including seven treatments: control; mineral fertilization; and different doses of sewage sludge (biosolids) complemented with potassium, due to the low concentration of this element in the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment plant of Barueri (Metropolitan region of Sao Paulo city). The results showed that the application of different dosages of biosolids promoted different responses in stem height and biomass production. The treatment with 20 g/dm(3) of dry sewage sludge promoted both the highest growth and the highest seedling biomass production, compared to the control treatment. All native tree species treated with the highest dosage of sewage sludge showed a growth similar to that of mineral fertilization. The seedlings of aroeira-pimenteira, pau-de-viola, and unha-de-vaca, all typical species of the initial succession in natural forest ecosystems, grew and produced more biomass than cabreuva-vermelha, a typical species of the final forest succession.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF STAND CHARACTERISTICS AND SOIL OF UPPER PARANA ATLANTIC FORESTS (PARAGUAY) REVEALS HIGH HABITAT HETEROGENEITY
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (UPAF) harbours some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. However, little data are available on UPAF ecosystems, constraining effective protection and restoration efforts. The objective of this study was to classify UPAF forests, focusing on the stand structure, tree species diversity, tree species composition, and soil properties and their relationships with stand characteristics. We established 71 plots (50 m x 20 m) distributed across eight protected areas in the Paraguayan UPAF and evaluated trees with diameter at breast height = 10 cm and composite soil samples from 0-20 cm in depth. We identified four forest types with their corresponding indicator species. Among these forest types, we observed significant differences between stand structure and tree species diversity. We separated the soil properties into two axes, with essential elements and pH on one axis, and the balance of clay and sand contents on the other. We found significant relationships between essential elements and pH and individual density, and between the balance of clay and sand contents and tree species diversity. Our findings explain the heterogeneity of the tree community and contribute to our understanding of the UPAF, enabling science-based and betterfocused forest conservation and restoration programmes.

TI  - Leaf litter decomposition aiming the monitoring of areas in ecological restoration process in Mato Grosso do Sul state
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The decomposition process helps in the balance and functioning of forest ecosystems by providing essential nutrients for the sustenance of plants. The objective was to evaluate the leaf decomposition as an indicator of functionality in three areas of environmental restoration by the planting of seedlings over ten years old in Mato Grosso do Sul state. The study was conducted in 2017 in the municipalities of Ivinhema, 13 years after planting (IV-13), Jatei at the age of 14 (JA-14) and Caarapo, 17 years old after planting (CA-17). Leaves of the forest floor surface were collected, oven dried at 65 degrees C and weighed in 10-gram portions to be placed in the litterbags, randomly distributed on the forest floor surface. To evaluate the loss of dry biomass, 10 litterbags were removed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days after installation. The percentage of the remaining mass, decomposition rates (k), the half-life (t 1/2) and Pearson's correlation (r) between the remaining mass and precipitation and temperature were estimated. The (k) in the 180-day period for CA-17 was 0.004 g g(-1) day(-1) and 0.003 g g(-1) day(-1) for IV-13 and JA-14, to the (t 1/2) was 269,49 days for IV-13, 218,29 for JA-14 and 194,89 days for CA-17. The (r) was weak for all areas and variables, except IV-13, which obtained moderate (r) for precipitation. The age of the plantations is not decisive, the decomposition is mainly governed by the internal and external characteristics of the areas. The indicator was efficient in understanding the decomposition rates, confirming a more accelerated foliar mass for CA-17 and JA-14, which can result in the faster release of nutrients to the soiland return to vegetation. It is recommended to use complementary indicators for a holistic understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems in restoration.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of Drosophila (Hexapoda, Diptera) in post-mining sites under different forest restoration techniques in the Brazilian Amazon.
T2  - Restoration Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas-Para, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years).

TI  - Direct seeded and colonizing species guarantee successful early restoration of South Amazon forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South Amazon forests have been highly deforested, including the legally protected riparian forests. The Xingu watershed restoration program used direct seeding of native trees to restore 5000 ha of forests from 2006 to 2018. Direct seeding is a low cost method, easy-to-implement at large scales. The literature on this method concludes that only a few species manage to establish successfully, resulting in an impoverished forest. In this study, we aimed to (i) assess changes in species composition over a 10-year chronosequence in direct seeded sites, (ii) evaluate life-history traits of direct seeded and colonizer species, and (iii) investigate whether colonizer arrival is influenced by landscape structure and dispersal syndrome. We sampled 72 1-10 year-old direct seeded sites along a latitudinal gradient of 600 km, at the Upper Xingu Basin, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. From the 152 direct seeded species, 90 species established themselves, and 67 new species colonized the restored sites. Succession started off dominated by a single pioneer species; then shared dominance with five other light-demanding species, while slow-growing species were present in the understory. Direct seeded and established species are disproportionately more orthodox, wind-dispersed seeds, usually dispersing during the dry season. Colonizer species are similar to the ones found in reference forests, regarding the proportion of animal-dispersed and recalcitrant seeds. We found no relationship between forest cover and colonizer richness. Direct seeding imposes a functional diversity filter due to the short period of seed harvesting, storage limitations, and field emergence. However, established species comprise diverse successional classes, which form an initial structure that facilitates species colonization, reducing the biodiversity filters caused by the direct seeding method over the years.

TI  - The urban river restoration index (URRIX) - A supportive tool to assess fluvial environment improvement in urban flood control projects
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - River restoration is a strategy for controlling floods and restoring fluvial environmental quality. Urban river restoration is a challenge and involves a complex discussion, which needs to focus on the whole watershed and to recognize practical limits for restoration, balancing nature and city needs as much as possible. In this context, aiming to provide a practical tool to assess environmental effects in the flood control design process, the Urban River Restoration Index (URRIx) is proposed to quantify the effects of design alternatives, considering river restoration concepts in an urban watershed, giving an objective measure to help in decision making. Additionally, the URRIx can also be used to continuously monitor the river restoration successfulness over time, after a design alternative is implemented. The URRIx presents a multi-criteria formulation and ranges between 0 (the most negative result) and 1 (the most positive). A case study in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area (Brazil) was conducted to exemplify this discussion. The URRIx was applied to assess urban river improvement, through an integrated evaluation of flood reduction, urban revitalization, and river improvement. Outputs present a relevant space for considering urban river restoration - under given constraints - as a viable and valuable approach even in complex and fragile contexts. (C)2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The role of sprouts in the restoration of atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative importance of sexual reproduction (seed) and sprouting as sources for regeneration in Brazilian Atlantic Forest was evaluated in three different successional forest stages: young forest, immature forest, and late-successional forest. Young plants (10-100 cm tall) of tree species were classified into the following categories: (1) seedlings that are nonsprouting-plants that originated through sexual reproduction as seeds; (2) stem base sprouting-plants that sprouted at the base of an existing plant; and (3) underground stem sprouting-plants that sprouted from subterranean stems of an existing plant. A total of 1,030 individuals of 48 species were collected. Underground stem sprouting is the rarest form of propagation, with stem base sprouting somewhat more common and possibly associated with recovery of damaged parts. The greatest contribution to regeneration was due to seeds: 92% of the individuals counted in 67% of the plant species. However, 13 species were "facultative" sprouters as seedlings and sprouters were observed in this group. The three forest ages differed in the proportion of regeneration strategies; in immature forest, sprouting was more common (15%) than in young (7%) and late-successional (3%; p < 0.05) forest. In these three forest stages, germinating seeds are the major source of new plants; although sprouting as a reproductive strategy is rare, it is related to recovery after damage of an already existing plant and may be due to previous land use history (agriculture) and low soil fertility. Restoration using natural regeneration should consider these factors to understand seed arrival as seed is the main source of regeneration.

T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyse the initial medium-term growth of a P. reticulata settlement under different phosphorus doses. The experiment was carried out in an area of Atlantic Forest, Sooretama, Northern Espirito Santo State, Brazil. Five doses of P per each tree (0 g, 27 g, 47 g, 67 g and 87 g) were tested in a randomized block design with three replicates and 18 plants per plot. At 3 months, 9 months and 15 months, height and diameter were measured at the soil level. At 36 months height, diameter at breast height, survival, basal area, and nutritional evaluation of the trees were measured. A logistic model was also used to model the growth in height of individual trees and a logistic model considering fixed effects and mixed form (fixed and random effects), in order to verify if the inclusion of the random effect (tree) would result in gains in terms of accuracy in the estimation of the future height of P. reticulata trees. The species presents potential for use in reforestation programs under edaphoclimatic conditions tested and under similar conditions. The species was not very demanding in P, and the addition of this nutrient promotes negative effects on its growth in the short and medium term. Regarding the model of growth in height, the logistic model adjusted in the mixed form showed to be superior to the traditional adjustment.

TI  - Modelling the performance of bunds and ditch dams in the hydrological restoration of tropical peatlands
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many tropical peatlands are subjected to artificial drainage that leads to degradation. Hence, hydrological restoration has recently been prioritized. Nevertheless, as field monitoring data are limited, little is known about how restoration measures, such as ditch dams and bunds, can regulate tropical peatland water tables. We used a hydrodynamic model -DigiBog_Hydro- to simulate the effectiveness of ditch dams and bunds across three El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scenarios, which are El Nino, La Nina and Neutral, in three typical sites. The sites were moderately degraded (Mod-Dgr) and severely degraded (Sev-Dgr) peatland plots (each 0.2 km(2)), representing typical peatland conditions in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our fine-scale (1 m x 1 m spatial resolution) modelling revealed that in the dry season of any ENSO scenario, the significant effects of ditch-dams alone on peatland water-level were limited to lateral distances of 26 m (in Mod-Dgr) and 12 m (in Sev-Dgr) from the ditch. In the dry season of an El Nino year, the combination of ditch dams and bunds helped maintain water levels up to 72 cm (in Mod-Dgr) and 69 cm (in Sev-Dgr) higher than in the no-restoration condition. During the extreme-dry period of an El Nino year, the bunds reduced the number of days when the water table was deeper than 40 cm in Mod-Dgr and in Sev-Dgr by 50% and 73%, respectively. We suggest that bunds used in combination with ditch dams are a practical restoration measure for tropical peatlands, providing critical extra water storage and helping maintain water tables near the peatland surface in dry periods. We also demonstrate how fine-scale hydrodynamic modelling is beneficial for planning and assessment of restoration measures in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water from three estuaries of China: Distribution, seasonal variations and ecological risk assessment
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution, seasonal variations and ecological risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water from three estuaries in Hai River Basin of China, which has been suffering from different anthropogenic pressures, were investigated. In three estuaries, the average concentration of Sigma PAHs was the lowest in Luan River estuary, followed by Hai River estuary, and the highest in Zhangweixin River estuary. There were significant seasonal variations in PAHs, the concentrations of Sigma PAHs were higher in November than in May and August. The composition profiles of PAHs in different sites were significantly different, and illustrated seasonal variations. Generally, 2-ring (Nap) and 3-ring PAHs (Acp, Fl and Phe) were the most abundant components at most sampling sites in three estuaries. The PAHs in three estuaries were mainly originated from pyrogenic sources. A method based on toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) and risk quotient (RQ) was proposed to assess the ecological risk of Sigma PAHs, with the ecological risk of individual PAHs being considered separately. The results showed that the ecological risks caused by Sigma PAHs were high in Hai River estuary and Zhangweixin River estuary, and moderate in Luan River estuary. The mean values of ecological risk in August were lower than those in November. The contributions of individual PAHs to ecological risk were different in May, August and November. 3-ring and 4-ring PAHs accounted for much more ecological risk than 2-ring, 5-ring and 6-ring, although the contributions of 5-ring and 6-ring to ecological risk were higher than these to PAHs concentrations.

TI  - Restoring and conserving rare native ecosystems: A 14-year plantation removal experiment
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plantations occupy 2% of Earth's land surface and are increasingly important in biological conservation both through their establishment and removal. To restore conservation-priority oak savannas and prairies in the Midwestern United States, we began a conifer plantation removal experiment in northwestern Ohio in 2002 and measured plant community response, including nectar plants for conservation-priority invertebrates, during a 14-year period. Oak (Quercus) trees, crucial to restoring savanna structure, only became established on plots where conifers were cut. In the understory, native species richness/0.05 ha was 34-50% higher on plots where conifers were cut than on control plots in uncut plantations. By year 14, cut plots accrued 13 species with high coefficients of conservatism (specialist species typifying high-quality natural habitats) and 10 state-listed rare species; uncut plantations did not contain any such species. With 71 wetland species detected during the experiment (out of 370 total plant species), only cut plots developed a wetland-upland biophysical gradient diagnostic of diverse Midwestern savanna-prairie landscapes. Between year 1 and 14 after plantation cutting, cover of nectar plants utilized by federally endangered Karner blue butterflies (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) doubled, while cover of these plants remained negligible in uncut plantations. Similarly, cover of plants utilized by bees increased by 24 x after plantation cutting. Cutting plantations rapidly and persistently benefited native species for at least 14 years, with minimal increase in non-native plants.

TI  - Iron-mediated stabilization of soil carbon amplifies the benefits of ecological restoration in degraded lands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent observations across a 14-year restoration chronosequence have shown an unexpected accumulation of soil organic carbon in strip-mined areas of central Brazil. This was attributed to the rapid plant colonization that followed the incorporation of biosolids into exposed regoliths, but the specific mechanisms involved in the stabilization of carbon inputs from the vegetation remained unclear. Using isotopic and elemental analyses, we tested the hypothesis that plant-derived carbon accumulation was triggered by the formation of iron-coordinated complexes, stabilized into physically protected (occluded) soil fractions. Confirming this hypothesis, we identified a fast formation of microaggregates shortly after the application of iron-rich biosolids, which was characterized by a strong association between pyrophosphate-extractable iron and plant-derived organic matter. The formation of microaggregates preceded the development of macroaggregates, which drastically increased soil carbon content (similar to 140 Mg C/ha) a few years after restoration. Consistent with previous theoretical work, iron-coordinated organic complexes served as nuclei for aggregate formation, reflecting the synergistic effect of biological, chemical, and physical mechanisms of carbon stabilization in developing soils. Nevertheless, iron was not the only factor affecting soil carbon content. The highest carbon accumulation was observed during the period of highest plant diversity (>30 species; years 3-6), declining significantly with the exclusion of native species by invasive grasses (years 9-14). Furthermore, the increasing dominance of invasive grasses was associated with a steady decline in the concentration of soil nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of accumulated carbon. These results demonstrate the importance of interdependent ecological and biogeochemical processes, and the role of soil-plant interactions in determining the success of restoration efforts. In contrast with previous but unsuccessful attempts to restore mined areas through nutrient application alone, iron-mediated stabilization of vegetation inputs favored the regeneration of a barren stable state that had persisted for over five decades since disturbance. The effectiveness of coupled organic matter and iron fertilization, combined with management of invasive species, has the possibility to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration and accelerate the restoration of degraded lands, while addressing important challenges associated with urban waste disposal.

TI  - Bird Functional Traits Respond to Forest Structure in Riparian Areas Undergoing Active Restoration
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wildlife responses is essential to assess restoration projects. Birds are widely used as bioindicators of ecosystem restoration, but most studies use only taxonomic descriptors to compare categories of reference and restoring sites. Here, we used forest structure as a continuous predictor variable to evaluate avifaunal taxonomic and functional indicators in riparian forest reference and restoration sites on southeastern Brazil. Reference sites were riparian forest remnants, and restoration sites were pasture before seedling reintroduction. Forest structure variables (mean tree height, canopy depth, mean diameter at breast height, basal area, tree layering, tree density, and grass cover) were reduced into two axes using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Forest Axis 1 (tree biomass vs. grass cover) and Forest Axis 2 (canopy depth vs. tree density). Bird species were classified in relation to five functional categories (i.e., diet, foraging stratum, nest height, cavity dependence for nesting, and forest dependence). Forest Axis 1 influenced the functional diversity of bird assemblages and the relative abundance within levels of each functional category (except for nest height). The relative abundance of all functional categories combined was also affected by Forest Axis 2. Therefore, forest structure affected the predominant functional traits of bird species in riparian sites under restoration. Sites with higher tree biomass were the richest, with canopy birds that were insectivores and frugivores of high forest dependence, whereas more open sites were associated with birds of low forest dependence and ground-foraging insectivores. Forest structures of similar-aged sites were strongly variable, due to natural and anthropic disturbances, so restoration age was a poor indicator of forest development. These unpredictable disturbances can change the development of sites under restoration, so that forest structure can be a better descriptor of the trajectory of these ecosystems.

TI  - Resilience of lowland Atlantic forests in a highly fragmented landscape: Insights on the temporal scale of landscape restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10-40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values.

TI  - Selection of Superior Senna macranthera Seeds, Carbon Stock, and Seedling Survival, and Costs for Habitat Restoration
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and recovery of degraded areas generate great demand for seeds of native tree species. The development and/or improvement of efficient techniques for the evaluation of forest-seed quality is important for the production and establishment of high-quality seedlings for restoration. In this study, the tissue density of radiographic images of Senna macranthera seeds was related to their physiological quality. Moreover, biomass, carbon stock, seedling survival, and X-ray technique costs were estimated for S. macranthera. Collected seeds were analyzed using digital radiography to measure relative and integrated density. The physical integrity of seed tissues was visually evaluated. Seeds were then germination tested to assess seedling development-related traits. Semiautomated radiography allowed for visualizing internal seed structures and observing their density and physical-integrity differences as well as physiological quality. Moreover, seed lots with lower relative and integrated densities had more physical damage and/or malformation, thus producing less vigorous seedlings. The average carbon stock was 21.42 kg per tree. The seed selection cost was USD 0.0132/seed at an 81% germination rate. The annual cost of planting S. macranthera seedlings was USD 7500 per hectare during the establishment year and averaged USD 1562 per year for replanting lost transplants over the eight years after initial planting. Applying these techniques may enhance the seedling production of this species, contributing to reforestation programs in Brazil.

TI  - The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool: estimating CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils under plantations
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change on Indonesian peatlands contributes to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accessible predictive tools are required to estimate likely soil carbon (C) losses and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from peat soils under this land use change. Research and modelling efforts in tropical peatlands are limited, restricting the availability of data for complex soil model parameterisation and evaluation. The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool (TROPP-CAT) was developed to provide a user friendly tool to evaluate and predict soil C losses and CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils. The tool requires simple input values to determine the rate of subsidence, of which the oxidising proportion results in CO2 emissions. This paper describes the model structure and equations, and presents a number of evaluation and application runs. TROPP-CAT has been applied for both site specific and national level simulations, on existing oil palm and Acacia plantations, as well as on peat swamp forest sites to predict likely emissions from future land use change. Through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, literature reviews and comparison with other methods of estimating soil C losses, the paper identifies opportunities for future model development, bridging between different approaches to predicting CO2 emissions from tropical peatlands under land use change. TROPP-CAT can be accessed online from www.redd-alert.eu in both English and Bahasa ndonesia.

TI  - Microclimate and pasture area preferences by dairy cows under high biodiversity silvopastoral system in Southern Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of microclimate on dairy cows' behaviors and their preferences for different pasture areas under high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnuclei) in a subtropical climate. We surveyed three different pasture areas under SPSnuclei: shaded area around the nuclei (SAN), unshaded area around the nuclei (UAN), and all-day sunny area distant from the nuclei (SDN). In each area, the microclimatic variables were measured-air temperature (degrees C), relative humidity (%), illuminance (lux), wind speed (m/s), and soil surface temperature (degrees C). In addition, the diurnal behaviors of 39 Jersey dairy cows were evaluated. Grazing, standing rest, lying rest, standing rumination, and lying rumination were registered by scans every 10 min; drinking water was observed continuously. Microclimate differed (p < 0.05) among the SPSnuclei areas. Areas around the nuclei provided better conditions of air temperature (SAN, 31.05 degrees C; UAN, 31.92 degrees C; SDN, 33.39 degrees C), illuminance (SAN, 5665 lx; UAN, 61,065 lx; SDN, 75,380 lx), and soil surface temperature (SAN, 27.35 degrees C; UAN, 32.38 degrees C; SDN, 35.87 degrees C). The frequency of use of each SPSnuclei area by dairy cows was different (p < 0.01); the highest frequencies of the grazing (SAN, 12.6%; UAN, 4.8%; SDN, 11.1%), rumination (SAN, 21.7%; UAN, 3.1%; SDN, 1.9%), and rest (SAN, 35.6%; UAN, 5.4%; SDN, 3.7%) were registered in the areas around the nuclei. The microclimate of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system leads the animals to perform grazing, ruminating, and resting preferentially on the areas around the nuclei even with no shade.

TI  - Relationships between soil properties and species establishment in the restoration of mined soils in the Cerrado biome
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring the ecosystems of the Cerrado biome is challenging considering the diversity of phytophysiognomies present in the biome, some of which are composed of species from different strata (herbaceous, shrubby, and arboreal), which increases the complexity of restructuring the floristic composition. Other factors was involved, such as soil quality, which directly influences the success of restoration, water storage, and nutrients, the financial costs, and a slow ecological process, due to the adverse circumstances found in the area. be restored. The strong anthropogenic interventions by mining processes reduce dramatically the physical and nutritional composition of the soil. We studied two restoration areas in Paracatu, Brazil, to examine their edaphic conditions six years after mining activities ceased and relate them to the status of the restoration process. In 2009, a Cerrado restoration were established in an area previously explored for gravel extraction. Plants were sampled and identified in 11 transects along the planting lines. The diameter base (DB) and total height (HT) were measured. The physical/chemical quality of the soil substrate was determined using a collection of samples in open trenches at four types of points: Cerrado (TC); dead plant pits (TM); seedling pits having living individuals of the most abundant species (TT); and those of the second-most abundant species (TE). Cecropia pachystachya Trecul and Tapirira guianensis Aubl. were most abundant and demonstrated the potential to thrive in areas degraded by mining having low mortality rates and growth at relatively DB and HT. The physical quality indicators in the gravel pits were not limiting, indicating that substrate preparation was efficient in this regard. The organic matter content in TM, TT, and TE was low in comparison to that of TC, and the chemical conditions in the TE pit substrates were similar to those in TM pits, suggesting C. pachystachya is a species with good plasticity, whereas T. guianensis is present in pits with higher levels of phosphorus.

TI  - Nitrogen accumulated and biologically fixed by uninoculated Anadenanthera peregrina (L.) Speg trees under monospecific stands in the Atlantic Forest biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen-fixing legumes are widely used to improve ecosystems. However, N accumulation in biomass, N-2 amounts biologically fixed, and the effects on soil N status are poorly understood for plantations with slow-growing N-2-fixing legume trees in seasonally dry environments. In this study, we assessed these questions in monospecific stands of uninoculated Anadenanthera peregrina (L.) var. peregrina (angico) trees established in the Atlantic Forest biome. Nine experimental plots with a stand density of 1111 tree ha(-1) were examined about five to six years after tree planting. N content in the leaves, branches, bark, and wood was estimated using allometric equations and N concentration in the tissues. To assess the N content, the topsoil layer was sampled in each plot and in one pasture area. The annual N-2 fixation rate at the stand scale was estimated by the natural abundance of N-15, using leaves of angico and a mix of leaves of herbs and shrubs growing in the understory in each plot. N accumulation in aboveground biomass was estimated at 260 kg ha(-1) and N allocated in the leaves and branches was four-fold that in the tree stem. N derived from biological N-2 fixation was estimated at 50% on average, with an annual rate of N fixed in the aboveground biomass of 22 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Soil N storage was similar between A. peregrina stands and the pasture area at six years after planting. Long-term gains of N-2 fixation may be greatly improved by the adoption of breeding programs for this slow-growing species and the use of an adequate rhizobium strain.

TI  - Diversity and ecosystem functioning: Litter decomposition dynamics in the Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between ecosystem functioning and species diversity is important for conservation and restoration management of endangered ecosystems. Here we experimentally analysed the effects of tree species richness and composition on the fundamental ecosystem process of leaf litter decomposition in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We measured the decomposition rates of leaf litter of eight broad-leaved, native tree species either individually or in mixtures of two, four, or six species. Additionally, we analysed the effect of macro- and meso-invertebrate exclusion using coarse- and fine-meshed litter bags. Species composition, but not species richness, significantly influenced litter decomposition rates. Invertebrate exclusion also influenced litter decomposition, although this effect varied between species and mixtures. Overall, litter decomposition dynamics was non-additive, i.e. observed decomposition rates of litter mixtures differed from what would be expected from the decomposition rates of their component species. However, there were also differences between mixtures, which could be at least partly attributed to the varying influence of invertebrates. We conclude that the relationship between the decomposition subsystem and species diversity in the Atlantic Rainforest follows the idiosyncratic response hypothesis and not the rivet hypothesis. For conservation or reforestation management, our results emphasise the need to maintain or restore the composition of locally native tree species communities rather than to maintain only a high tree species richness.

TI  - Ten principles for restoring campo rupestre, a threatened tropical, megadiverse, nutrient-impoverished montane grassland
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve the ambitious goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, restoration frameworks should embrace the diversity of ecosystems found on Earth, including open-canopy ecosystems, which have been largely overlooked. Considering the paucity of scientific foundations promoting restoration science, policy, and practice for open tropical ecosystems, we provide overarching guidelines to restore the campo rupestre, a Neotropical, open megadiverse grassland that has been increasingly threatened by multiple human activities, especially mining. Restoration techniques for tropical grasslands are still at its infancy, and attempts to restore campo rupestre have had, so far, low to moderate success, highlighting the need for a tailored restoration framework. In a scenario of increasing degradation and scarcity of on-site restoration experiments, we propose 10 principles to improve our ability to plan, implement, and monitor restoration in campo rupestre: (1) include socioeconomic dimensions, (2) implement active restoration, (3) keep low soil fertility, (4) restore disturbance regimes, (5) address genetic structure and adaptation potential, (6) restore geographically restricted and specialized ecological interactions, (7) incorporate functional approaches, (8) use seed-based restoration strategies to enhance biodiversity, (9) translocation is inevitable, and (10) long-term monitoring is mandatory. Our principles represent the best available evidence to support better science and practice for the restoration of campo rupestre and, to some extent, can be useful for other megadiverse, fire-prone, and nutrient-poor ecosystems.

TI  - Less hay collected at more dates: toward successful restoration of subtropical grasslands by hay transfer
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hay transfer is a promising method to restore temperate and subtropical grasslands, but its efficiency may depend on the harvesting timing and amount of hay used. We evaluated effects of harvest date (mid-spring/November, early summer/December, and mid-summer/February) and hay quantity (500 and 1000 g/m2) on vegetation cover, species richness, and species composition in an experimental study in subtropical southern Brazil for a period of 2 years. We transfer undried hay from a well-conserved reference area onto a former grassland site degraded by pine plantations. Hay harvested during mid-spring and early summer led to higher soil cover and species richness compared to the mid-summer hay treatment in the first year of the experiment. A drought spell decreased vegetation cover in the second year following the hay transfer, with the mid-spring hay treatment being the least affected. C3 grasses were more effectively introduced by mid-spring and early summer hay, in contrast to C4 grasses that were better introduced by mid-summer hay. Lower quantities of hay tended to lead to higher cover and species richness for all harvest dates. Freshly cut undried hay can be an effective way to reintroduce native species in degraded subtropical grasslands. We conclude that timing of hay collection and the amount of hay used influence vegetation cover and species composition at the restoration site and that multiple harvest dates increase restoration success. The drought in the second year of the experiment illustrates the need to consider the possibility of adverse climatic conditions in restoration planning.

TI  - Mapping tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests with hyperspectral and multispectral data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping the spatial distribution of tree species in tropical environments provides valuable insights for ecologists and forest managers. This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450-919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045-2400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200,1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.

TI  - Unveiling the Diversity of Bangka Island's Mangroves: A Baseline for Effective Conservation and Restoration
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state of the mangrove ecosystem on Bangka Island requires urgent attention from the local government to protect, restore, and conserve the remaining mangrove areas. Hence, this study endeavors to assess the species composition of mangroves on Bangka Island, examining their correlation with edaphic factors and shedding light on the zonation pattern within the region. We examined species composition, edaphic factors, and zonation patterns along 20 m x 100 m transects perpendicular to the waterfront at 22 sampling sites distributed across Bangka Island. Our findings revealed the presence of 21 mangrove species from ten families, including two mangrove associates. Among the documented species, the Rhizophoraceae family exhibited the highest floristic abundance with nine species. Edaphic factors (soil texture, pore-water salinity, N-total, P, and K) significantly influenced mangrove species composition (p < 0.05). However, these factors explained only 37.2% of the overall variability, suggesting additional factors contribute to the diverse zonation and composition of mangroves on Bangka Island. This study has relevant implications for the conservation and management of mangroves on Bangka Island. By gaining insight into the specific site's floristic composition, overall richness, and distribution, our findings can guide effective conservation and restoration strategies by understanding the factors shaping mangrove composition.

TI  - The road to recovery: a synthesis of outcomes from ecosystem restoration in tropical and sub-tropical Asian forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Current policy is driving renewed impetus to restore forests to return ecological function, protect species, sequester carbon and secure livelihoods. Here we assess the contribution of tree planting to ecosystem restoration in tropical and sub-tropical Asia; we synthesize evidence on mortality and growth of planted trees at 176 sites and assess structural and biodiversity recovery of co-located actively restored and naturally regenerating forest plots. Mean mortality of planted trees was 18% 1 year after planting, increasing to 44% after 5 years. Mortality varied strongly by site and was typically ca 20% higher in open areas than degraded forest, with height at planting positively affecting survival. Size-standardized growth rates were negatively related to species-level wood density in degraded forest and plantations enrichment settings. Based on community-level data from 11 landscapes, active restoration resulted in faster accumulation of tree basal area and structural properties were closer to old-growth reference sites, relative to natural regeneration, but tree species richness did not differ. High variability in outcomes across sites indicates that planting for restoration is potentially rewarding but risky and context-dependent. Restoration projects must prepare for and manage commonly occurring challenges and align with efforts to protect and reconnect remaining forest areas.The abstract of this article is available in Bahasa Indonesia in the electronic supplementary material.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - An ecosystem approach to small-scale fisheries through participatory diagnosis in four tropical countries
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory diagnosis is an approach to identify, prioritize and mobilise around factors that constrain or enable effective governance and management in small-scale fisheries. Diagnostic frameworks are mostly designed and used for systematic scientific analysis or impact evaluation. Through participation they also have potential to guide contextually informed improvements to management in practice, including transitions to contemporary forms of governance like the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) the focus of our study. We document and critically reflect on participatory diagnosis processes and outcomes at sites in Indonesia, Philippines, Solomon Islands and Tanzania. These sites were part of an international project on the implementation of the EAF and differed widely in institutional and operational contexts. The Participatory Diagnosis and Adaptive Management framework and the "issue radar" diagnosis map were used to identify, evaluate and address factors associated with navigating management transitions towards the EAF. We found that many challenges and priority actions identified by participants were similar across the four study countries. Participants emphasized habitat restoration, particularly mangrove rehabilitation, and livelihood enhancement. The importance of strengthening governance entities, networks and processes (e.g., harmonization of policies, education and awareness of policies) was also a prominent outcome of the diagnosis. Site-specific factors were also explored together with the differing views among stakeholders. We conclude that diagnosis frameworks are indeed useful tools for guiding management transitions in fisheries, particularly where they enable flexibility in approaches to diagnosing problems and applying solutions to local contexts.

TI  - EVALUATION OF SEED RAIN IN AREAS OF RESTINGA WITH DIFFERENTS REGENERATION STAGES
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in an area of restinga in the municipality of Silo Vicente (SP). The study aimed to evaluate the seed rain in three different conditions of regeneration. Was selected the following conditions: High Forest of Restinga in the middle stage of regeneration, an area of clearing in the same condition mentioned above and a third in early stages of regeneration. hi each condition were installed 10 seed collectors made of wood and screen with 80% of shade, supported to a height of 20cm of soil. They were evaluated monthly for one yew; the densities of seed deposited in the collector these seedlings are identified and categorized based on their dispersion syndrome and successional classes. The Area of High Forest area was carried out a phytosociological survey to identify which seedlings present in the rain could be from these areas. It was found that the densities of seedlings are relatively low compared to other formations of the Atlantic rain forest, but consistent with other studies of the same type of vegetation used in the study. Regarding dispersal syndromes and successional classes, there was prevalence of the zoocoric syndrome and species of secondary successional classes. The results indicate that the area has good ability to maintain their succession dynamics.

TI  - Environmental Damages in the Atlantic Forest Biome
T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - We identified the main impacts, drivers, and restoration projects for Atlantic Forest in Northwest of the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The objective was to analyze the quantity, distribution, and causes of the environmental crimes in 2000-2014. To verify differences between degraded and restored areas, we performed a t-test; ANOVA for the municipalities with more quantity of crimes, simple linear regression analysis for the relationship between sizes of degraded areas and quantity of seedlings planted, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for environmental damages categories and population of the municipalities. The main environmental damages found were deforestation outside permanent preservation area (20%) and those related to Permanent Preservation Area (37%). Environmental crimes in these areas fall into two categories: native and exotic vegetation removal (17%), and impediment to natural regeneration (20%). The average size of the degraded areas was 5,359±526 m2, while for restored areas was 3,337±255 m2. The sizes of the degraded fragments were similar among the five municipalities with the higher number of environmental crimes (ANOVA: p＞0.05, F=1.24; df=241). The number of seedlings planted was positively related to the sizes of the degraded fragments (p＜0.001, R2=0.53). Segregation between the less and the most populous municipalities was found with the PCA analysis along PC1 (51.7%), while PC2 represented 19.2% of the total variation. The most populous municipalities showed the highest number of environmental crimes, and the majority of degraded areas were recovered by planting native seedlings. Atlantic Forest fragments need to be recognized and preserved as an ecosystem with a unique ecological function by the population and public administration.

TI  - Phenology of the tree community in a seasonal forest in southern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variations in environmental factors, such as precipitation, influence plant phenology and the relative importance of each factor, differ according to the ecosystem in question. In this study, we evaluated the phenology of 60 tree species in a seasonal semi-deciduous forest located at the southern border of the tropical zone (23 degrees 26 ' 35"S and 51 degrees 15 ' 30"W) during 3 years. We aimed to investigate the relationship of leaf fall, leaf flushing, budding, flowering, immature and mature fruit phenophases with precipitation, temperature and photoperiod. We also analyzed whether the phenological patterns of tree community were seasonal and similar between consecutive years. Although the climate of the region is classified as Cfa, there are two distinct season: a hot humid summer and a cold drier winter. Leaf fall occurred predominantly in the dry season, with leaf flushing and flowering at the end of the dry and early wet season. The mature fruits were observed throughout the year. For the six phenophases analyzed, the percentage of species did not differ among the three study years. The tree community presented, in general, weakly seasonal phenological patterns, mainly in response to variations in temperature and photoperiod. The mature fruits showed seasonal patterns when the species were grouped by dispersal syndrome. This predictability suggests that small inter-annual variations in precipitation and temperature are not relevant for the studied tree species' phenology.

TI  - Towards an improved understanding of greenhouse gas emissions and fluxes in tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - At present, there is insufficient data to understand the processes driving emissions and fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia (SEA). In this review, we discuss fundamental factors controlling emissions of major GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from tropical peatlands and their contribution to global climate change. Classifying peatlands in tropical and subtropical regions can aid in understanding their emission characteristics. The applicability of existing GHG emission factors to land use categories in SEA is discussed. We find that rewetting peatland can increase CH4 emissions, and therefore more studies are needed to establish whether peatlands act as a net sink or net sources of GHGs. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of liming towards reducing peat soil acidity. The review also finds that there is limited data on CO2 concentrations in drainage and wildfire areas, N2O fluxes in agriculture areas, and the impact and reduction of CH4 in tropical peatlands. Addressing these research gaps could support the development of a framework for GHG emission measurements and abatement in tropical peatlands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial ponds and swamps commonly occur throughout logged forests of Southeast Asia in association with roads. Dammed streams accumulate water, which floods the surrounding forest creating ponds and swamps, which are slow to recover to a condition that maximises their conservation value. In particular, ponds remain relatively anoxic and the self-recovery of swamps is slow due to delayed colonisation by swamp tolerant species. The Harapan Rainforest ecosystem restoration concession in Sumatra is a clear example of this issue. Within the 100,000 ha of lowland rain forest, four watersheds are present with more than 750 km of rivers and their tributaries. Across this area more than 175 artificial ponds and swamps have been created through the construction of the road network over the past 3040 years. Despite the artificial nature of their creation there is a significant conservation value in improving the alluvial swamps due to the significant decline in extent of this habitat across Southeast Asia. However, tropical forest streams too have been widely degraded and are a conservation priority due to the uniqueness of their associated biodiversity. As such, we propose the restoration of these habitats through the drainage of ponds to improve stream flow and connectivity and the establishment of swamp specialist tree species. An approach for identifying sites suitable for restoration is presented focusing on making comparisons with 'model' streams and swamps. Restoration techniques are proposed, including a list of swamp species suitable for planting trials at swamp sites and techniques for the suppression of disturbance responsive species, such as bamboos, ferns and lianas. We stress that pond restoration activities in general should always include unmanaged control ponds to enable the measurement of the additional benefit of restoration activities beyond that of natural recovery.

TI  - Long-Term Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry Systems Recover the Structural Quality of Ultisol Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry Systems (ICLFS) offer stakeholders sustainable options to produce goods and services. Those additionally manifest as enablers of environmental conservation of soil functioning. We, therefore, analyzed the quality of Ultisol for physical and chemical properties under restorative or regenerative models of long-term (nine years) ICLFS. The arrangements comprised integrated Crop-Livestock; integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry, integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry with a single or triplicate rows of Eucalyptus; and Eucalyptus plantation, natural vegetation, and bare soil with resurgence of grasses (reference). We collected samples of soil at 0.05, 0.05-0.1, and 0.1-0.2 m depths throughout the areas to quantify standard properties, including water infiltration, hydraulic conductivity, degree of flocculation, mechanical resistance to penetration, stability of aggregates, physical fractioning of organic matter, and fertility. We applied principal component analysis to analytical data to calculate accurate discriminant variables to distinguish systems by structural quality. We obtained evidence for the crop-livestock framework improving physical and chemical properties; hence, this intervention outperformed others in developing environmental restoration. Additionally, as the reference consisted of comparable properties to those in integrative systems and native vegetation, it supported the ability of the soil to gradually recover itself over time. Therefore, our study provides knowledge to advance the field's prominence in implementing ICLFS for the environmental reclamation of the condition or process degrading the soil and its functions for sustainable agricultural production.

TI  - Fire management in Pantanal livestock: perceptions and opportunities for sustainable management in the biome.
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is characterized by the prevalence of extensive cattle ranching as its primary economic activity. The utilization of fire emerges as a pivotal tool in ranching management, employed for pasture renewal, parasite control, and vegetation clearance. However, during the period from 2019 to 2020, the biome witnessed a distressing surge in wildfires, inflicting considerable damage upon the ecosystem, and environmental services, and engendering socio-economic repercussions. In conjunction with drought, inadequate fire management practices within cattle ranching are identified as contributing factors to this disconcerting scenario. Given the preponderance of privately owned properties dedicated to livestock, discerning ranchers' perceptions concerning the utilization and management of fire becomes imperative for formulating efficacious conservation strategies within the ecosystem. This study examined the subtleties of fire utilization and management practices among ranchers in 11 sub-regions of the Brazilian Pantanal. Conducted between December 2021 and March 2022, 70 individuals affiliated with livestock activities in the Pantanal region were interviewed through both in-person and telephonic means, adhering to a protocol of semi-structured questions. The findings illuminate that despite the historical utilisation of fire over centuries, most contemporary ranchers harbour a predominantly pessimistic viewpoint owing to recent losses. Disparities emerge between traditional and more recent entrants into ranching concerning strategies and opportune moments for fire deployment. Noteworthy criticisms are directed towards recent land-use alterations, particularly in response to environmental constraints, as these alterations are perceived to culminate in the accrual of organic matter, thereby serving as fuel for devastating conflagrations. Ranchers reveal a degree of perplexity regarding the legislation governing fire usage and exhibit significant variances in fire management practices across distinct Pantanal subregions. These results underscore the imperative for targeted interventions aimed at enhancing comprehension of existing regulations and fostering constructive dialogues with ranchers to cultivate a more realistic approach to fire management that harmonizes biodiversity conservation imperatives with the socio-cultural idiosyncrasies of the region.

TI  - Reproductive phenology of critical native plant species for mineland restoration in the eastern Amazon
T2  - PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon ironstone outcrops vegetation, or canga, is a remarkable environment in which the plants are adapted to peculiar circumstances. Knowledge regarding different aspects of this ecosystem remains modest, including necessary insights for its conservation and recovery, such as the reproductive phenology of priority species that form the plant community. This study aimed to monitor the reproductive phenology of critical native species that are categorized as rare, endemic, and/or threatened in the canga of the Amazon Rainforest, in Para, Brazil. During February 2016 and May 2017, eleven species were evaluated regarding the presence or absence of flowering and fruiting phenophases, and these were associated with environmental variables. Phenological data were evaluated through circular statistical analysis. All studied species flowered and produced fruit during the monitoring period. The evaluated species have an annual reproductive cycle marked by seasonality and flowering peaks between March and April, during the wet season, and fruiting peaks during May, at the beginning of the dry season. The best period for collecting ripe seeds, a primary tool for the restoration of degraded areas, is June. Water availability may be essential for the establishment of annual plants and to induce flowering in both annual and perennial species. The reproductive phenophases of the studied species are concentrated within a short period and are synchronized, which may increase the possibility of cross-pollination and minimize flower and seed predation. We discuss the challenges in including annual plants and the importance of having them and perennial species in conservation and restoration of degraded areas projects.

TI  - Native grass sod and plug production as an alternative technique to restore neotropical rupestrian grassland after mining
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite the importance of grasses in the structure and functioning of tropical grasslands, there is still a lack of efficient and economically viable techniques to produce and introduce grasses in restoration projects. Here, we evaluated the sod and plug-plant production and planting of a native grass from Brazilian rupestrian grasslands, Sporobolus metallicolus, in a post-bauxite mining. To produce the sod, we used post-mining substrate and its mixture with commercial substrate. Then, we sowed 270 seeds of S. metallicolus on a 4-cm layer of substrate in 144-cm(2) trays. Eighty days after sowing, we subdivided the contents of each tray (substrate + plant) into 4 x 3-cm plug-plants. Plug-plants were planted in the degraded area with and without the incorporation of litter from an adjacent conserved rupestrian grassland. We also evaluated the cost of production of each plug-plant. The mixture of substrates provided greater plant growth and rooting, obtaining plug-plants with an average of 13 individuals, dry mass of 270 mg, and estimated cost of US$ 0.0045. In the degraded area, the addition of litter increased shoot biomass gain. Plant survival was 100% with and without litter addition and the plants started seed dispersal at 7 months after planting. The production of S. metallicolus plugs with the mixed substrate and the growth of plants in the post-mined area showed promising results and reduced costs, indicating technical and financial feasibility. The presented techniques can be an option for introducing grasses in degraded areas and optimize the use of seeds.

T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on general systems theory, in Optical Chaos Theory and aided by the Systems Engineering has developed an ecological model system for the environmental recovery treating the area as a complex dynamic system, hypersensitive to initial conditions to prepare the ground. Assuming that the degraded areas are hypersensitive to the initial conditions of soil preparation, we applied the technique to trigger the roughness over time emergent properties that speed up the process of environmental recovery. Was evaluated in the process of the evolution of environmental restoration components, soil, vegetation, wildlife, water and microclimate under the effect of roughness, as auxiliary components in the internalization of matter and energy in the degraded area. We compared the evolution of biotic and abiotic environmental variables in the model preparation of rugged terrain with the conventional model, consisting of flat surfaces and more regular. It was confirmed that the roughness behave as gravitational attractor generated islands of diversity, the system incorporates a dynamic hypersensitive to these initial conditions and act as nucleation triggering effect amplified by the feedback, which increase and accelerate the recovery environment. All biometric variables Mimosa scabrella species (height, stem diameter, DBH and crown area) and height of the spontaneous vegetation had faster growth in irregular areas, resulting in environmental changes of abiotic factors. It was concluded that the ecological model proposed and the practical results obtained validate the influence diagram as an important tool to understand the causal relationships and feedback of the variables and their temporal evolution in the process of environmental recovery.

T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival and initial growth of Euterpe edulis seedlings transplanted to two light conditions: gaps (clearing area) and understory. Moreover it discusses their ecophysiologycal behavior on these two micro-sites. Ninety seedlings of Euterpe edulis with height about 5 and 25 cm were transplanted in six plots: three on understory and three 3 on gaps (clearing area) in a 2x2m spacing with three rows of plants containing five plants each one. The survival percentage during the period of the study was 36.7% whereas on gaps (clearing area) it was 53.3% and on understory it was 20%. A non-linear regression showed a positive relationship between canopy openness and seedling of E. edulis. The higher survival rate of seedlings on gaps (clearing area) than on understory can be explained by the excess of shade on the latter, caused by the low canopy openness percentage (4.78% on average). There was no influence of canopy openness on seedling height growth.

TI  - Enzymatic stoichiometry in degraded soils after two decades of restoration in a Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation has emerged as a significantly pressing environmental concern, contributing to the decline of soil properties in both arid and semiarid regions. Despite this, there is limited understanding of how degradation and subsequent long-term restoration efforts impact enzymatic stoichiometry in soils of the Brazilian semiarid area. Therefore, our study aimed to quantify C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes in soil samples from the Caatinga, a Brazilian semiarid region. We compared three different conditions: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation, primarily dominated by Fabaceae species; (b) Restored land, resulting from two decades of grazing exclusion; and (c) Degraded land due to overgrazing, characterized by high-intensity grazing practices. A total of 54 soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 cm during both dry and rainy seasons to evaluate the levels of C-, N-, and Pacquiring enzymes and their respective stoichiometries. Our findings revealed that, overall, C- and N-enzymes showed higher and similar levels between native and restored land, whereas these enzyme levels significantly decreased (approximately 60% for C-enzymes and 80% for N-enzymes) in degraded land. Moreover, P-acquiring enzymes exhibited a notable decrease (approximately 70%) in degraded land specifically during the dry season. The degraded land exhibited a higher C/N ratio (8.5) during the rainy season compared to native land (4.8). Conversely, higher values of C/P and N/P ratios (both during rainy seasons) were observed in native land (0.3 and 0.07, respectively). Redundancy analysis showed that native and restored lands clustered with all acquiring enzymes and were notably influenced by key soil properties such as organic C, microbial biomass C, and nutrients. In contrast, degraded land showed correlations with Al3+ and Na+. Our results provide substantial evidence that Caatinga soils affected by degradation may be microbially P-limited. This underscores the necessity of integrating P-enriched amendments or fertilizers and implementing long-term restoration practices.

T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Native grasslands in the Campos de Cima da Serra, Brazil, are being converted at speed for exotic tree plantations and cropland. The impact of modified and novel soil conditions on the establishment of native grassland species is unknown; establishment of non-native species, deliberately or accidentally introduced, could be favoured. In a common garden composed of fully randomized replicate samples of soils collected from remnant grassland, former cropland and pine plantations, we tested emergence and establishment of five cold-season species: Native low-tussock grass Piptochaetium montevidense (Spreng.) Parodi; native legume Trifolium riograndense Burkart; naturalized low-tussock grass Vulpia bromoides (L.) Gray; low-tussock grass Holcus lanatus L., cultivated and naturalized in Brazil; and a cultivar of non-native Trifolium repens. Other than expected, soil type and species*soil type interactions had no significant effect on seedling emergence after 132 days in the field. Species effect on seedling emergence, however, was highly significant. Vulpia bromoides emergence was significantly highest in all soil types. Holcus lanatus and Trifolium riograndense both achieved second highest emergence rates and did not differ significantly from each other. Lowest overall emergence rates were found in the non-native clover cultivar. Lab germination tests failed for Piptochaetium, although it showed reasonable emergence in the field. Good performance of the native clover is encouraging for future grassland restoration, but the value of highly germinable Vulpia as a forage remains to be tested. Holcus tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and its life history traits may promote naturalization, or even invasiveness. Native grasslands of the region should be monitored for this species. Studies like these, but set up on a larger geographical scale and with a wider array of native species, will be essential in developing ecological restoration methods for southern Brazilian grasslands.

TI  - Soil seed bank after 25 years of the planting of tree vegetables in a degraded area - Seropedica, RJ
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In highly degraded areas such as degraded land, human intervention is critical so that the environment can recover its ecological functions. One of the techniques used for this process is the use of leguminous trees associated with microorganisms. Ecologically, these species are distinguished by associating symbiotically with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. This alliance enables a significant improvement of the plant???s nutritional status, accelerating the process of ecological succession and thus contributing to the area???s restoration. Given this knowledge, in 1989, began the revegetation of a clay loan area with seedlings nodulated and mycorrhizal legume trees. As such, this study aims to assess the ecological succession of a degraded land located in the experimental field of Embrapa Agrobiologia, Serop??dica -RJ. Therefore, we evaluated the seed bank and the stock of litter. The use of leguminous trees has proved its effectiveness in activating the mechanisms of natural succession. Twenty-five years after planting legumes, 37 species of 16 botanical families emerged, besides the improvement of soil fertility and supply of litter. The study reflects the need to give more importance to other forest guilds in restoration projects, even considering the success of tree legumes in the catalysis of the ecological succession process.

TI  - Roads and forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus dispersion
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

TI  - The exotic wasp Megastigmus transvaalensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae): first record and damage on the Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolius drupes, in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper records the first report of Megastigmus transvaalensis Hussey (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) in Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) drupes in Sorocaba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This wasp is an invasive species and was found damaging S. terebinthifolius drupes in urban areas (35.0+/-15.8%), natural forests (21.5+/-10.2%) and restoration areas (15.8+/-8.4%). The bio-ecology and damage caused by M. transvaalensis in the S. terebinthifolius drupes warrants further study focused upon the management of this phytophagous wasp. Megastigmus transvaalensis has a potential to be disseminated throughout Brazil and is posing a threat to the natural regeneration of S. terebinthifolius in the native forests and restoration areas and ecological regions of this country.

TI  - Future trends for biodiversity in urban afforestation of São Paulo, Brazil: insights for the restoration decade
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sao Paulo city has three municipal nurseries for the distribution of urban tree specimens that meet the demand for its public landscape projects and increase in tree covering. One of them (Manequinho Lopes) receives tree seedlings from the environmental compensation processes contracted with the Municipal Secretariat for Green and Environment (MSGE). This paper aimed to evaluate the scenario of tree biodiversity received between July 2013 and July 2018 by the Manequinho Lopes nursery, as a measure of environmental compensation. The results indicated that 144,727 tree seedlings were received by the nursery, with approximately 80% of the total belonging to only 30 species, half of them belonging to only 10 different groups. We found just two predominated families: Myrtaceae and Bignoniaceae, , highlighting a biotic homogenization risk. Regarding ecological attributes, it was found that 33% of the species were zoochoric, 16% autochorous and 22% anemochoric. Most of them were non-endangered specimens.

TI  - A combined geostatistical approach of data fusion and stochastic simulation for probabilistic assessment of shallow water table depth risk
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In general, water table depth risks are estimated from monitoring networks that mostly provide scarce and irregular data. When jointly analysed, environmental, agricultural and geotechnical variables, treated as stochastic spatial variables, can better describe and interpret the states of a certain system subject to estimation uncertainty. Risk assessment consists essentially in calculating the frequency (probability) with which specified criteria are exceeded or fail to be met by creating multiple stochastic realizations. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel geostatistical methodology, based on the integration into one approach of multi-source data fusion and stochastic simulation, to estimate the risk of extreme(shallow) water table depth, and illustrate a demonstrative example of application of the approach to a case study in a Cerrado conservation area in Brazil. The risk of shallow water table depth was determined by using critical thresholds for water table level and a binary transformation into an indicator variable depending on whether the conditions expressed by the threshold values are met or not. Firstly, auxiliary variables were jointly, analysed to provide a delineation of the study area into homogeneous zones. Secondly, sequential indicator simulation provided a-posteriori probabilities taking into account spatial proximity. The final maps show the most probable risk category for the whole area and spatial entropy as a measure of local uncertainty. Areas nearby watershed divisors and in the north part of the region have a high risk of shallow groundwater. Informed decision-making supported by probabilistic maps and uncertainty evaluation is essential for the success of the projects of Cerrado restoration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of biodiversity offsets to achieve net gain
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the outcomes and tracking the trajectory of biodiversity offsets is essential to demonstrating their effectiveness as a mechanism to conciliate development and conservation. We reviewed the literature to determine the principles that should underpin biodiversity offset planning and the criteria for offset evaluation at the project level. According to the literature, the core principles of equivalence, additionality, and permanence are used as criteria to evaluate conservation outcomes of offsets. We applied the criteria to evaluate offsets of a large iron ore mining project in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. We examined equivalence in terms of the amount of area per biodiversity value affected and fauna and flora similarity, additionality in terms of landscape connectivity, and permanence in terms of guarantees to ensure protection and restoration offsets lasting outcomes. We found an offset ratio (amount of affected area:offset area) of 1:1.8 for forests and 1:2 for grasslands. Ecological equivalence (i.e., similarity between affected and offset areas) was found for forested areas, but not for ferruginous rupestrian grasslands or for fauna. Landscape metrics showed that connectivity improved relative to the preproject situation as a result of locating restoration offsets in the largest and best-connected forest patch. Permanence of offsets was addressed by establishing covenants and management measures, but financial guarantees to cover maintenance costs after mine closure were lacking. Offsets should be equivalent in type and size, provide conservation outcomes that would not be obtained without them (additionality), and be lasting (permanence). To monitor and evaluate offsets, it is necessary to determine how well these 3 principles are applied in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of offsets. Achieving measurable conservation outcomes from offsets is a long-term endeavor that requires sustained management support, and is information intensive. Thus, offsets require ongoing monitoring and evaluation as well as adaptive management.

TI  - Understorey vegetation gradient in a Eucalyptus grandis plantation between a savanna and a semideciduous forest
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Plant community assemblage is influenced by many factors, including soil characteristics and the arrival of diaspores from surrounding areas. These factors may be especially important in transition areas, leading to spatial gradients in the plant community.Methods: This study was performed in the understorey of an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden plantation between a savanna and a forest, 490 m apart, in south-eastern Brazil. This study assessed whether the spatial variation in several variables related to the understorey's structure and composition is best described by linear or non-linear (quadratic) models. The linear model would indicate a gradient between the two vegetation types, whereas the quadratic model would indicate a stronger effect of the plantation's edges.Results: There was a gradient in species composition between the two edges of the plantation. Mean vegetation height was greatest at the savanna edge and lowest in the centre of the plantation. The total number of individuals per plot and the phylogenetic diversity decreased with distance from the savanna edge. Different patterns were observed for different dispersal syndromes, with animal dispersal being more common at the savanna edge, wind dispersal in the centre of the plantation and self dispersal at the forest edge.Conclusions: The greater number of individuals at the savanna edge may indicate that dispersal and arrival of diaspores are the most important factors influencing community structure and composition of the understorey of this abandoned E. grandis plantation, with most propagules coming from the savanna area. The smaller vegetation height in the centre of the fragment may also indicate older colonisation at the edges. Therefore, in addition to highlighting the recovery potential of undergrowth beneath abandoned Eucalyptus spp. plantations, these results show that this recovery is spatially heterogeneous and that dispersal plays a large role in it. This should be taken into account in restoration projects. The authors recommend careful consideration before removing regenerating Eucalyptus spp. trees as part of the site restoration. Instead the focus should be on the recovery potential of the undergrowth, with gradual removal of Eucalyptus trees, if necessary.

TI  - Playback point counts and N-mixture models suggest higher than expected abundance of the critically endangered blond titi monkey in northeastern Brazil.
T2  - American Journal of Primatology
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of threatened species requires accurate population size estimation and monitoring. However, reliable population size estimates are lacking for many endangered species. The critically endangered blond titi monkey (Callicebus barbarabrownae) is an endemic primate of the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. A previous assessment based on presence-only data estimated a minimum population size of 260 mature individuals in 2,636 km2, and studies based on visual records suggested very low local relative abundance. However, this cryptic species is known to be difficult to visually detect. We played back recordings of C. barbarabrownae loud calls to count the number of responding groups in 34 sampling sites during 9 consecutive days in a 221-km2 study area. Repeated group counts at sites were used in N-mixture models, which account for imperfect detection, to estimate the number of groups in relation to dry forest area and distance to villages. We estimated a total of 91 groups in the study area. Considering the mean number of adults per group as three, we estimated a population of 273 adult individuals, resulting in a density of 2.3 individuals/km2 in the dry forest habitat. Detection probability was four times higher for surveys conducted between sunrise to midmorning than between midmorning to sunset. We also found that C. barbarabrownae abundance increases with increasing dry forest area and increasing distance to the nearest village, indicating the need to promote dry forest restoration in the Caatinga. As our results suggest a larger population of C. barbarabrownae than had been previously estimated for its entire distribution, our results suggest a need for similar assessments in other areas to reliably estimate the total population size. This study demonstrates how playback surveys coupled with N-mixture models can be used to estimate population sizes of acoustically-responsive Primates, and thus contribute to more effective conservation management.

TI  - Biochar Effects on Two Tropical Tree Species and Its Potential as a Tool for Reforestation
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: We find that biochar plus fertilizer has synergistic and positive effects on seedling growth and robustness, but slightly lowers early seedling survival. Biochar plus fertilizer has the potential to greatly decrease costs associated with afforestation as compared to traditional fertilization and gives better results. Background and Objectives: Biochar can improve soil fertility and plant yield in crops. However, there is little information regarding the effects of biochar on trees, even though reforestation/afforestation projects are increasing and are often unsuccessful due to soil fertility limitations. This study aims to increase knowledge of biochar use as a reforestation tool. Materials and Methods: We measured survival and growth in an early ((Guazuma crinita Mart. [n = 240])) and a late (Terminalia amazonia (J.F. Gmel.) Exell. [n = 240]) successional species under 6 different biochar treatments in a 6-month nursery experiment. Results: (i) Survival was highest in the 1 t/ha biochar treatment, while treatments containing fertilizers or biochar at 5 t/ha lowered the survival rate of both species compared to the control; (ii) simultaneous addition of biochar and fertilizer lead to significant increases in height, diameter, total number of leaves, and aboveground and belowground biomass of both species as compared to other treatments; (iii) biochar treatment containing 1 t/ha with and without fertilizer showed significantly better results than applications of 5 t/ha; and (iv) Guazuma crinita responded more strongly to treatments containing biochar and fertilizers compared to Terminalia amazonia, which is suggestive of greater synergetic effects of biochar and fertilizer addition on early successional tree species. Conclusions: Applying biochar and fertilizer is synergistic and outperforms any single treatment, as well as the control, in terms of plant performance. This case study suggests that biochar can greatly improve reforestation/afforestation projects by increasing plant performance while substantially reducing fertilizer and labor maintenance costs. Field experiments and testing of additional species is needed to generalize the findings.

TI  - Approaches for Understanding and Embedding Stakeholder Realities in Mangrove Rehabilitation Processes in Southeast Asia: Lessons Learnt from Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a soft systems narrative, this paper examines the implementation process growing out of a policy environment intended to promote the rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystems. The analysis is based on research conducted 2007-09 in the Mahakam Delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. The rich and diverse natural resource base of the area has turned East Kalimantan into one of the wealthiest areas in Indonesia. The case from Mahakam reveals that there is no stakeholder consensus in terms of problem definitions and management priorities of the coastal delta area. Further, there are no institutional bodies or 'guardians' responsible for monitoring and facilitating the long-term sustainability of mangrove systems. There are also significant power imbalances in the system, not only between stakeholders, but also between the discourses of conservation and production. In order to ensure the long-term, sustainable governance of mangrove systems, these institutional and geopolitical issues will need to be addressed and adapted accordingly. Through a structured systemic inquiry, this analysis has explored the problem situation related to the sustainability of mangrove systems for coastal environments and people. The research shows the complexity in managing dynamic coastal systems subjected to rapid human induced biophysical changes exacerbated by a non-conducive policy environment aggravating the impact on the ground.The absence of this guardian implies that feedback and institutional learning is not inherent, making constructive adaptation of governance and management arrangements in this context unlikely.

TI  - Examining the Use of Mass Transplantation of Brooding and Spawning Corals to Support Natural Coral Recruitment in Sulawesi/Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral transplantation is frequently advocated as a possible means of coral reef rehabilitation. One of the purported benefits of transplantation is a positive effect of transplants on coral recruitment by sexual reproduction of transplants (seeding) and/or settlement cues generated by the presence of live coral (attraction). However, evidence for this assertion is scarce. Here, we investigated the effect of coral transplantation on larval recruitment. A total of 6,164 fragments of four coral species (acroporids and pocilloporids) were transplanted at three sites in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Coral recruitment onto limestone settlement plates was examined every 3 months and on concrete structures at the end of the study (15months) in the presence and absence of transplants. Transplant survival after 1year ranged between 20 and 30% for pocilloporids and between 40 and 80% for acroporids. Transplantation had no consistent effect on the number of coral recruits on the settlement plates or on the concrete structures. Recruitment was relatively high compared to other locations in the region and fluctuated seasonally, with increased rates in all treatments during peaks of reproduction. We conclude that, in the presence of high background recruitment and detrimental environmental conditions, coral transplantation may not be an effective method to boost coral recruitment. The provision of stable substrate for settlement in the form of artificial reefs, combined with improved management to reduce chronic stressors, constitutes a better use of resources.

TI  - Soil Aggregation and Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi as Indicators of Slope Rehabilitation in the Sao Francisco River Basin (Brazil)
T2  - SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activity along the Velhas River (Sao Francisco River basin) has destabilized the banks of the river channel across an urban fragment. To improve the physical stabilization, the base of the slope was stabilized with urban construction waste. After this, the slope was revegetated with native species and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) inoculation was applied with a successfully restoration of the vegetative cover and ecological functions. This study aims to evaluate the role of the AMF population in the soil aggregation and stabilization of the revegetated slope. The soil aggregation was higher at the experimental site than at the disturbed site, especially under the AMF inoculation. The aggregates improvement was accompanied by an increase of soil humic acid and glomalin contents 24 months after the transplantation despite a flood impact 12 months after the transplantation. A scatter plot based on Principal Component Analysis of aggregates Showed that the preserved site samples clustered with most of those from experimental site. However, some samples from experimetal site were found between those from preserved and disturbed sites. This result shows that the recovering site is evolving toward the conditions of the preserved site and that the rehabilitation process is in an intermediate phase related to the aggregate formation. The AMF inoculation of woody species was indicated in the rehabilitation procedures.

TI  - Land cover change, landscape degradation, and restoration along a railway line in the Amazon biome, Brazil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Railways are known to have less influence on land use than other transportation systems. However, railways also affect biodiversity, water resources, socioeconomic outcomes, and land prices. In the context of changes in land cover and land use (LCLU) classes, this study analyses the changes arising from the establishment of the Carajas Mining Project in 1984 along the more than 900-km length of the Carajas Railway (CRW) in southeastern Amazonia. LANDSAT-5 (1984) and LANDSAT-8 (2014) satellite images and human settlement layers (1990 and 2015) along CRW were used to assess LCLU changes. Satellite images were analysed with the geographic object-based image analysis method to detect changes in LCLU classes, including municipalities located less than 50 km from the CRW. The results showed that in 1984, the areas of influence of the CRW consisted of 69% forest cover, 24% nonforest cover, 3% water, and 2% cloud cover. In 2014, forest area dropped significantly to 43%, whereas the nonforest class expanded to 46%. This analysis revealed that the conversion of forests to pastures represents the major landscape degradation that occupy 51% of the study site mainly in rural human settlement areas, which are interlinked with the construction of the CRW. Only 6% of the total area exhibits a trend of restoration marked by secondary vegetation growing. The land occupation model along the CRW is characterized by rural settlements, associated with roads and extensive pasturelands. Construction of this railway in a certain way prevented the fishbone occupation type as observed in the western Amazon.

TI  - Effects of deforestation on environmental heterogeneity and its role in the distribution of fish species and functional groups in Amazonian streams
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The advance of deforestation impacts freshwater ecosystems and, consequently, the environmental heterogeneity and associated biodiversity. Our objective was to examine the effect of deforestation on environmental heterogeneity (EH), species richness (SR), and functional richness (FRic) and the role of EH in the abundance of species and functional groups of stream fish. We analyzed 71 streams of the Acara-Capim basin, eastern Amazon. We used path analysis to assess whether land-use types influence the predominant vegetation cover and channel characteristics, and their indirect effect on EH, SR, and FRic. Taxa indicator threshold analysis was used to assess whether fish species and functional groups act as bioindicators of EH and percentage of forest in total catchment (PFTC). The higher percentage of secondary forest in total catchment (PSFTC) favored herbaceous understory plants and SR. The largest amount of sediments and higher PSFTC negatively influenced EH. FRic was not influenced by any of the variables. Species with high swimming ability that belong to the trophic guilds piscivores and invertivores, are associated with high values of EH and PFTC. Our results may be useful for riparian forest restoration projects, as we show which variables increase or decrease EH and demonstrate how bioindicators respond to this.

TI  - Soil seed bank under Tachigali vulgaris (LGSilva & HCLima) plantations in different spacing in the eastern region of the State of Para, Amazon
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the floristic composition, richness, diversity, evenness and similarity of the soil seed bank of a plantation of Tachigali vulgaris L.G.Silva & H.C.Lima in different spacings (4 m x 2 m, 4 m x 3 m and 4 m x 4 m) at approximately seven and half years of age, located in the Genesis Farm in Dom Eliseu (PA). Seed bank samples were collected in 30 m x 50 m plots with four replications for each spacing, eight points were randomly drawn in each plot to collect soil at a depth of 5 cm. The soil collected from the eight points was mixed, and from the mixture, four composite samples were taken for each plot, totaling 16 samples for each spacing. Soil samples containing the seeds were placed for seedling emergence in the greenhouse of Embrapa Amazonia Oriental. Seedlings were counted and identified monthly for four months. Herbaceous plants stood out both in presence and abundance of species in the three spacings. In the 4 m x 3 m spacing the highest estimate of Jackknife I richness was observed. The three spacings showed low species diversity and evenness and high floristic similarity. The seed bank in the soil presented the same characteristics in floristic composition, presence and abundance of herbaceous plants, diversity, evenness and similarity in the three spacings analyzed. Any of the three spacings of Tachigali vulgaris can be used in planting this species for area recovery.

TI  - Ten years of directing seeding restoration in the Brazilian savanna: Lessons learned and the way forward
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas and grasslands have lost almost 50% of their original cover worldwide. Therefore, the development of methods and information on open-canopy ecosystem restoration is urgent for the inclusion of these ecosystems into global and regional priorities. In the Brazilian savanna, the most diverse savanna in the world, restoration efforts focused on open ecosystems have been virtually absent, but have increased in the last 10 years. Such efforts are frequently threatened by invasive exotic grasses (IEG) that invade and dominate areas excluding native species, oftentimes aided by altered soil conditions. Long-term studies of savanna restoration trajectories are rare. In this study, we surveyed 22 savanna restoration areas established two to ten years before the study with similar restoration methods to assess their current status. We show that the current restoration methods are successful in establishing native species and allowing species turnover but they are threatened by IEG. Restoration success varies and is affected by soil conditions, IEG landscape cover and post-sowing weeding. Despite that, the simultaneous introduction of different plant functional groups allows turnover from fast to slowgrowing plants. Establishing savanna native species is possible at an operational scale with current knowledge and techniques. However, native species establishment fails to prevent IEG reinfestation, which needs to be managed in restoration efforts in the Brazilian savanna.
