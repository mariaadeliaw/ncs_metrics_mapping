TI  - Lack of protected areas and future habitat loss threaten the Hyacinth (Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) and its main food and nesting resources
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss is a major reason for population declines and thus increases extinction risk, particularly for endemic or specialist species. Protected areas are an important biodiversity conservation strategy in the face of native vegetation conversion, but local and regional factors such as anthropogenic pressure can jeopardize their effectiveness. The Pantanal biome is one of the largest inland wetlands in the world. Currently, only 11% of the Pantanal is protected, 7% with full protection and 4% under sustainable use. However, 14% of the natural vegetation of the biome was lost between 2002 and 2014, negatively affecting its biodiversity. Here, we analyse how the availability of protected areas and habitat loss affects the conservation of the Hyacinth Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, as well as the Acuri Palm Attalea phalerata and the Manduvi Tree Sterculia apetala, its two main resources for food and nesting, respectively. We modelled potential distributions to assess the spatio-temporal patterns of habitat loss due to the conversion of native vegetation and to evaluate to what degree currently protected areas contribute to the conservation of these three species in the Pantanal. We found that, on average, 11.8% of the suitable habitat had been converted and that 10.6% of habitat predicted as suitable is currently protected. In addition, our results indicated important areas for the three species, which are of high priority for conservation and restoration. We also identified priorities for protection and restoration to maintain native vegetation, such as the creation of corridors. We believe that the high conversion rate and the low protection of suitable areas are related to the fact that these species are associated with areas that are rarely or never flooded. In the Pantanal, these areas are more prone to the conversion of native vegetation and are poorly protected given their higher economic value compared with areas with a high frequency of flooding. These facts, and the inadequate management of these areas, such as inappropriate fire regimens, threaten the persistence of these iconic species in the Pantanal.

TI  - Characterizing subsidence in used and restored peatland with Sentinel SAR data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland is a fragile ecosystem in the tropical region which is prone to subsidence. Until now, there is still lack of procedure to rapidly assess a tropical peatland subsidence in a large area. Our objective was to compare subsidence in a used and restored zone in a peatland hydrological unit using synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-1A products (SAR data) in South Sumatra, Indonesia from the period of 2014-2021. The subsidence rate of used peatland estimated by the D-InSAR procedure were in the range of 28-80 cm year(-1) in the early period of its utilization and becoming less for the consecutive year (16-48 cm year(-1)). Meanwhile, the subsidence rate based on the field surveys was in the range of 4-50 cm year(-1) in the early period of peatland utilization. The subsidence rate in the used peatland zone (agriculture and plantations) was higher than that in the restoration zone for all SAR data pairs used in our study. The SAR data is a potential tool for the assessment, monitoring and differentiating subsidence rates among different peatland uses in a large area. This tool will help the Directorate of Peat Ecosystem Degradation Control, Directorate General of Environmental Pollution and Degradation Control, and Ministry of Environment and Forestry to plan for better peatland management and restoration.

TI  - Growth analysis of five Leguminosae native tree species from a seasonal semidecidual lowland forest in Brazil
T2  - DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Leguminosae family is one of the most representative families in the seasonal semidecidual lowland forest, and many of their species have economical and ecological importance, including for the recovery of degraded areas. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the biology of native species for forest restoration. Tree growth dynamics features, such as increment rates, life expectancy and tree responses to environmental variations can be assessed through tree-ring studies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the growth features of Copaifera langsdorffii, Dalbergia nigra, Pterocarpus rohrii, Schizolobium parahyba and Senna multijuga trees in a known age experimental plantation. The study site was located in Espirito Santo State, southeastern Brazil. Stem discs were obtained for anatomical characterization of tree-rings. Wood samples were sectioned and processed following the usual plant anatomy techniques. For macroscopic analysis, samples were polished and analyzed under a stereoscopic microscope. All species showed distinct growth rings with annual periodicity formation. Growth rates, tree size measurements and growth trajectories were established for each species. These features varied even among trees of the same age and species growing under homogeneous conditions. It is noteworthy that growth variation was not related to the species' ecological group. These data are important to characterize growth behavior of native species in order to subsidize species selection for recovery of degraded areas and economical purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Herbivorous fish rise as a destructive fishing practice falls in an Indonesian marine national park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Securing ecosystem functions is challenging, yet common priority in conservation efforts. While marine parks aim to meet this challenge by regulating fishing through zoning plans, their effectiveness hinges on compliance levels and may respond to changes in fishing practices. Here we use a speciose assemblage of nominally herbivorous reef fish in Karimunjawa National Park (zoned since 1989) to investigate whether areas subject to a restrictive management regime sustained higher biomass over seven years compared to areas where moderate and permissive regulations apply. Using a trait-based approach we characterize the functional space of the entire species pool and ask whether changes in biomass translate into changes in functional structure. We track changes in predator biomass, benthic community structure, and fishing practices that could influence herbivore trajectories. Overall herbivore biomass doubled in 2012 compared to 2006-2009 and remained high in 2013 across all management regimes. We found no evidence that this biomass build-up resulted from predator depletion or increased food availability but suggest it emerged in response to a park-wide cessation of fishing with large drive nets known as muroami. The biomass increase was accompanied by a modest increase in taxonomic richness and a slight decrease in community-scale rarity that did not alter functional redundancy levels. Subtle changes in both functional specialization and identity of assemblages emerged as generalist species with low intrinsic vulnerability to fishing recovered sooner than more vulnerable specialists. While this implies a recovery of mechanisms responsible for the grazing of algal turfs and detritus, restoring other facets of herbivory (e.g., macroalgal consumption) may require more time. An increase in the cost-benefit ratio per journey of muroami fishing facilitated a ban on muroami nets that met minimal resistance. Similar windows of opportunity may emerge elsewhere in which gear-based regulations can supplement zoning plans, especially when compliance is low. This does not advocate for implementing such regulations once a fishery has become unprofitable. Rather, it underlines their importance for breaking the cycle of resource depletion and low compliance to zoning, thus alleviating the resulting threats to food security and ecosystem integrity.

TI  - Pioneering in Marginal Fields: Jatropha for Carbon Credits and Restoring Degraded Land in Eastern Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper highlights the role of a national Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in Indonesia as "pioneer" actor in the jatropha global production network, linking solutions for local problems with narratives concerning global concerns. Analysis of previous activities of the NGO positions their jatropha project as one period in a sequence of donor-funded appropriate technology programs. On the island of Flores in Eastern Indonesia the NGO aimed to establish community based jatropha cultivation exclusively on "degraded land", avoiding threats to food cultivation, and responding to local problems of land degradation and water resources depletion. In contrast with investors interested in jatropha based biofuel production for export, the NGO aimed at developing biofuel for local needs, including jatropha based electricity generation in the regional state-owned power plant. Anticipating progress in international and national regulations concerning the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) the 2008 project's design included carbon credit income as a main source of future project financing. Using methods of socio-legal studies and political ecology, this study indicates that when the economic feasibility of a project is based on the future financial value of a legally constructed commodity like carbon credits, the sustainability of the project outcome can be questionable. The author recommends precaution when it comes to including anticipated income from carbon credits in calculating the economic viability of a project, as price developments can fluctuate when political support and regulations change.

TI  - Phytosociology of natural regeneration as a subsidy for restoration in post-harvest areas of Pinus sp. in the Mixed and Dense Ombrophilous Forest
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration in permanent preservation areas (PPA) in forest restoration process after Pinus sp. harvest through the survey of phytosociological parameters.. The study was carried out in the PPA, associated with springs and rivers in two areas with different post-harvest ages of Pinus sp., being inserted in Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF - 7 years old) and Dense Ombrophilous Forest in transition (DOF/MOF - 12 years old) both in the Santa Catarina state. Nineteen rectangular plots with dimensions of 25 m x 4 m (100 m(2)) were allocated at random in each one of the areas, for the floristic-structural evaluation of the tree-shrub regenerative component. In the DOF in transition, 913 regenerating individuals of tree and shrub species were sampled, belonging to 90 species, 60 genera and 30 botanical families. The species with the highest importance value were Cupania vernalis (8.71%), followed by Bernardia pulchella (5.93%), Aureliana wettsteiniana (5.25%). At MOF, an area undergoing restoration in less time, 782 regenerating individuals of tree and shrub species were sampled, belonging to 62 species, 21 botanical families and 30 genera. The species with the highest importance value were Myrsine coriacea (10.06%), Solanum variabile (9.79%), Myrsine lorentziana (7.08%). Shannon's diversity indexes were H' = 3.76 for DOF in transition and H' = 3.24 for MOF, and showed a high diversity of species, whereas the Pielou equability index obtained J = 0.81 for DOF in transition and J = 0.77 for MOF, showing high uniformity in the distribution of individuals in the species for the two areas. The diametric distribution of the individuals showed an "inverted J" pattern for both phytophysiognomies, behavior expected in native forests. The NMDS (Non-metric multidimensional scaling) presented a stress value of 9.81% indicating suitability of the ordering and allowing inferences to be made with reliability. Through the NMDS ordering, it was observed the formation of two distinct floristic-structural groups, associated with MOF phytophysiognomies and MOF/DOF transition. All plots inserted in MOF areas are grouped to the right in the ordering, while most plots inserted in the MOF/DOF transition area are grouped to the left of the ordering. The tree-shrub regenerative component evaluated in post-harvest areas of Pinus sp. at both phytophysiognomies has a great diversity of species with great importance for forest formation, being a favorable environment for the conservation of species and essential to guarantee the succession of the forest and the restoration resilience.

TI  - Impact Assessment of Timber Harvesting Operations for Enhancing Sustainable Management in a Secondary Atlantic Forest
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and management of forest ecosystems are currently largely conflicting goals in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. At present, all parts of the Atlantic Forest are protected and commercial logging is highly restricted. However, sustainable forest management systems can offer significant income opportunities for landholders, and thereby actively support the process of ecosystem rehabilitation and protection of the Atlantic Forest. This research is intended to contribute to enhancing the development of environmentally sound forest management alternatives in the Atlantic Forest biome. Through a case study, the harvesting impact of a conventional harvesting method (CM) was evaluated and compared with an alternative and improved harvesting method (AM), performed by a well-trained professional chainsaw operator experienced in reduced impact logging techniques, and included the use of a snatch block and a skidding cone. Following a full pre-harvest inventory, 110 different tree species were identified. The harvesting impact on the residual stand was classified and evaluated through a successive post-harvest inventory. Damage maps were developed based on interpolation of tree damage intensities with the triangular irregular networks (TIN) methodology. Our results showed noticeable high rates of tree hang-ups, observed for both harvesting methods. Furthermore, the harvesting damaged trees mainly in the lower diameter at breast height (DBH) classes. In comparison to winching, the felling process caused most of the damage to remnant trees for both methods, at 87% (CM) and 88% (AM). The number of damaged trees (above 11.9 cm DBH) per harvested tree, for CM, ranged from 0.8 trees to 2.5 trees and, for AM, ranged from 0.6 trees to 2.2 trees. Improvements of the AM method (operator skills, skidding cone and snatch block) over CM allowed for a reduction of the damaged basal area, a reduction of the "high damaged area" per plot, and a reduction of the winching disturbed ground area. Nonetheless, a suitable harvesting system should consider further improvements in the felling technique, and additionally integrate the local knowledge of CM regarding forest and tree species with the technical improvements of AM.

TI  - Free Flight Training as a Tool for Psittacine Reintroductions
T2  - BIRDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Macaw and parrot populations are declining because of a combination of habitat loss and capture for the illegal trade. As a result, IUCN Red List data suggest many are candidates for captive-based conservation efforts. Unfortunately, when captive-raised parrots are released, many fly off and get lost in the landscape or get killed by predators, making it difficult to establish new populations. Previous research suggests that pet parrots trained using free flight methods can form good flocks in flight, avoid predators, and navigate well, all skills that should help them survive in the wild. Here, we conduct a small-scale, proof-of-concept study using free flight methods and three already trained adults in the release of six captive-bred Blue-and-yellow Macaws in southeastern Brazil. All six released birds stayed together and remained near the release site, avoided predators, learned to feed themselves, and survived without supplemental feeding for over one year. One bird was captured and briefly held by local people but was recovered and rereleased and is doing well. This work suggests that free flight training can help captive-raised parrots survive release into the wild and make it easier to establish new populations of parrots and macaws in areas where they have gone extinct.Abstract As habitat loss and other threats accelerate, ecological restoration and reintroduction science are becoming progressively more important. The psittacines are among the most endangered bird groups and are prime candidates for restoration through reintroduction. Unfortunately, post-release survival of captive-raised animals is often quite low because, in part, of high predation rates, low site fidelity, poor flight ability, and low flock cohesion. Current best practices in parrot release hold the birds in captivity for a year or more and include distinct methods to address each of these challenges. Here, we conduct a small-scale, proof-of-concept study using free flight methods and human-socialized trained adult birds to hand raise and release a group of six fledgling Blue-and-yellow Macaws in their historical range in southeastern Brazil. All six released birds showed strong flock cohesion and fidelity to the release site, avoided predation, and survived without supplemental feeding for over one year. One bird was captured by local people but was recovered and rereleased and it has reintegrated into the group and is still alive and doing well. The human-socialized trained adult birds modeled both desirable behaviors (flocking, foraging, reacting to predators) and undesirable behaviors and they were returned to captivity before the conclusion of this study. Our study suggests that free flight training has great potential to help captive-raised young attain a broad array of vital skills needed for survival post-release.

TI  - Tolerance and resilience of forest species to frost in restoration planting in southern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Listing potential species for restoring areas has become a complex task considering the lack of information regarding the silvicultural behavior of native trees after planting and their responses to environmental conditions. Frost is an important meteorological phenomenon that regulates the distribution of plant species, especially in subtropical regions. Thus, we evaluated the effect of frost and the resilience potential of native forest species in restoration planting of a riparian forest in southern Brazil. The experimental design used was randomized blocks in a 6 x 2 factorial scheme (6 species and 2 containers). During the winter in 2014 (270days after planting), the damage from the impact of frost was assessed through a rating scale ranging from 0 (100% of the leaf area and damaged stem) to 10 (no visual damage). In addition, to assess species resilience, the height and stem diameter were measured, prior to the winter of 2014 and at 270 and 360days. Eugenia involucrata and Schinus terebinthifolius were considered frost tolerant species. Parapiptadenia rigida was classified as moderately frost tolerant, while Casearia sylvestris, Cupania vernalis, and Inga vera were very sensitive to frost. Casearia sylvestris, E. involucrata, P. rigida, and S. terebinthifolius showed potential for recommencement of growth. On the other hand, C. vernalis and I. vera were considered too sensitive to frost, with high mortality rates and/or no resilience potential.

AB  - Residues generated in sugarcane production such as biochar, originated from bagasse burning, are used as a fertilizer source, which can increase forage dry matter yield, as well as improving soil chemical attributes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of using biochar from sugarcane bagasse burning and mineral fertilization, as well as their association, on the dry matter yield of Urochloa decumbens and on the chemical attributes of the soil. The design was randomized blocks, which consisted of eight treatments and four blocks. The treatments were: T1- mineral fertilization; T2- fertilization with limestone plus mineral fertilizer; T3- liming; T4- biochar; T5- biochar plus mineral fertilizer; T6- liming plus biochar; T7- double fertilization with biochar and T8- control. Association of mineral fertilizer and biochar was able to increase dry matter yield by up to 131% when compared to the control treatment during the first year. The use of fertilization strategies in the restoration of degraded area under U. decumbens does not interfere with soil chemical attributes, except for sulfur.

TI  - Facilitation and allelopathy mediate phylogenetic and functional diversity under Atlantic Rainforest trees
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phylogeny, diversity, and production of germination inhibiting chemicals can be used as patterns for inferring key drivers of plant community construction and assembly. We conducted the study in a restoration area of Atlantic Rainforest from Southeast Brazil. In this context, we aimed to investigate community assembly rules by simultaneously evaluating the relationships of species with a phylogenetic, functional, and ecophysiological (allelopathy) approach and multifaceted beta diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional). We measured the plant canopy height and diameter at soil height for all individuals and determined successional group and dispersal syndrome for all species regenerating in open areas and below 18 adult individuals of each tree species Bixa atlantica Antar & Sano, Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd., Joannesia princeps Vell. and Senna multijuga subsp. multijuga var. verrucosa (Vogel) H.S.Irwin & Barneby. Phylogenetic and functional indexes of community structure were calculated with the net relatedness index and the nearest taxon index. Taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversities (respectively, TD, PD, and FD) for the regenerating community in each area were calculated and pairwise comparisons were made for TD, FD, and PD components of beta diversity. Tests of tree species allelopathy derived from leaf extract were performed with seeds of Lactuca sativa L. (Asteraceae). The effects of diversity and extracts on seed germination were analyzed using generalized linear models. The phylogenetic and functional structure of the regenerating communities under the four tree species did not differ from random for the four studied tree species. The PD was significantly higher for the communities that regenerated under Joannesia, while the FD was higher under both Joannesia and Senna, compared to communities from open sites, evidencing a facilitation mechanism for these two species. Only Senna and Inga differed from random in relation to beta TD and beta FD, suggesting possible environmental changes in these areas. Seeds irrigated with the extracts of Inga, Joannesia, and Senna inhibited germination in an intermediate way, whereas seeds irrigated with Bixa extract had only 1 % germination, indicating allelopathic effects. In this way, the planted species directly influence the organization of communities that regenerate below their canopies. It is therefore important to choose species that can contribute to improving diversity, and thus favor the success of restoration projects.

TI  - Structure, Biomass and Diversity of a Late-Successional Subtropical Atlantic Forest in Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The highly biodiverse Atlantic Forest has been heavily exploited and its remnant areas, which are mostly composed of secondary forests, cover less than 20% of its original extension. This study analyzed the structure, aboveground biomass (AGB) and species diversity of a secondary evergreen rainforest in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Individuals with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm on 22 sample plots were measured, totalizing 3.49 hectares of sampled area. A mean AGB of 201.6 Mg ha-1 (standard deviation = 35.5) was found; Hyeronima alchorneoides and Miconia cinnamomifolia represented 29.1% and 7.6% of the community AGB ha-1, respectively. A total of 153 species distributed in 107 genera and 55 families was observed; it was estimated that 121 species (95% confidence interval: [117, 125]) occurred in one hectare. These results highlight the importance of secondary forests for biodiversity restoration/conservation and carbon sequestration.

TI  - Comparing direct land use impacts on biodiversity of conventional and organic milk-based on a Swedish case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Halting the loss of biodiversity while providing food security for a growing and prospering world population is a challenge. One possible solution to this dilemma is organic agriculture, which is expected to enhance biodiversity on the farmland. However, organic products often require larger areas. This study demonstrates how we can quantify and compare the direct land use impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional food products such as milk.This study assessed direct land use impacts of 1 l of milk leaving the farm gate. Inventory data on land occupation were extracted from a life cycle assessment study of 15 farms in southern Sweden. Direct land use change data were derived from the FAO statistical database. Spatially differentiated characterization factors of occupation (CFOcc) and transformation (CFTrans) were calculated based on the relative difference of plant species richness on agricultural land compared to a (semi) natural regional reference. Data on plant species richness and regeneration times of ecosystems (for calculating transformation impacts) were derived from a literature review. To account for differences in biodiversity value between regions, a weighting system based on absolute species richness, vulnerability and irreplaceability was applied.Organic milk had a lower direct land use impact than conventional milk, although it required about double the area. Occupation impacts dominated the results and were much smaller for organic than conventional milk, as CFOcc of organic land uses were considerably smaller. For transformation impacts, differences between the two farming practices were even more pronounced. The highest impacts were caused by soymeal in concentrate feeds (conventional milk) due to large-scale deforestation in its country of cultivation (i.e. Brazil and Argentina). However, lack of reliable data posed a challenge in the assessment of transformation impacts. Overall, results were highly sensitive to differences in land occupation area between farms, the CFOcc and assumptions concerning transformed area. Sensitivity and robustness of results were tested and are discussed.Although organic milk required about twice as much land as conventional, it still had lower direct land use impacts on biodiversity. This highlights the importance of assessing land use impacts not only based on area but also considering the actual impacts on biodiversity. The presented approach allows to quantify and compare hot- and coldspots in the agricultural stage of milk production and could potentially also be applied to other agricultural products. However, more research is needed to allow quantification of indirect land use impacts.

TI  - The selection of indicator species of birds and mammals for the monitoring of restoration areas in a highly fragmented forest landscape
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicator species are frequently used to monitor restoration areas. However, species of conservation concern are usually absent in highly fragmented landscapes, making the selection of indicator species a challenging task. Here, we select indicator species of birds and mammals to be used for the evaluation of restoration sites in a highly fragmented landscape, the Capivara-Taquarucu Dams region located in north Parana, Brazil. By using the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), we show that the Capivara-Taquarucu Dams landscape has low IBI values and bird richness when compared with two other landscapes in the north of Parana. Therefore, we used the Individual Indicate Value to identify birds and mammals associated with forest fragments in the Capivara-Taquarucu Dams landscape. Six bird and four mammal species were selected as indicators of forest fragments, none of which were of conservation concern. However, monitoring of these species could help evaluate the recovery of restoration sites in the Capivara-Taquarucu Dams region. Lastly, several species of birds and mammals were frequently recorded in the restoration sites, including vulnerable species such as the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). This is indicative that restoration sites can be important habitats in highly fragmented landscapes despite the loss of biodiversity.

TI  - Modeling Environmental Vulnerability for 2050 Considering Different Scenarios in the Doce River Basin, Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climate change and land use impacts is crucial for mitigating environmental degradation. This study assesses the environmental vulnerability of the Doce River Basin for 2050, considering future climate change and land use and land cover (LULC) scenarios. Factors including slope, elevation, relief dissection, precipitation, temperature, pedology, geology, urban distance, road distance, and LULC were evaluated using multicriteria analysis. Regional climate models Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios were employed. The Land Change Modeler tool simulated 2050 LULC changes and hypothetical reforestation of legal reserve (RL) areas. Combining two climate and two LULC scenarios resulted in four future vulnerability scenarios. Projections indicate an over 300 mm reduction in average annual precipitation and an up to 2 degrees C temperature increase from 2020 to 2050. Scenario 4 (RCP 8.5 and LULC for 2050 with reforested RLs) showed the greatest basin area in the lowest vulnerability classes, while scenario 3 (RCP 4.5 and LULC for 2050) exhibited more high-vulnerability areas. Despite the projected relative improvement in environmental vulnerability by 2050 due to reduced rainfall, the complexity of associated relationships must be considered. These results contribute to mitigating environmental damage and adapting to future climatic conditions in the Doce River Basin.

TI  - Propagation and establishment of rupestrian grassland grasses for restoration of degraded areas by mining
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigations on the propagation and establishment of native grasses of rupestrian grassland on degraded substrates are essential to enable their use in the restoration of degraded areas, thus reducing the use of exotic species. This study aimed to evaluate the sexual and asexual propagation, establishment and growth of Axonopus laxiflorus (Trin.) Chase and Sporobolus metallicolus Longhi-Wagner & Boechat, two native grasses from rupestrian grassland developed on laterite substrate of an area degraded by bauxite mining In greenhouse experiments, A. laxiflorus was propagated by tillers and S. metallicolus by seeds and tillers. Both species were also evaluated for germination in a germination chamber on the treatments: control, addition of potassium nitrate and heating at 80 degrees C for 2 min. In these evaluations, success of S. metallicolus germination was between 77 and 90%, without significative difference among treatments, whereas A. laxiflorus did not germinate. In the laterite substrate, S. metallicolous, propagated by seeds, showed 29% of survival, whereas in the vegetative propagation all plants of the two species survived. Eight months after starting the tiller experiment, S. metallicolus and A. laxiflorus presented a biomass increase of 239 and 75%, respectively. Although A. laxiflorus showed root biomass approximately seven times higher than S. metallicolus, the two species presented similar root length, that is, S. metallicolus contained more fine roots. The results show that the species can efficiently propagate vegetatively and, in the case of S. metallicolus, sexually. The success of the species in a substrate poor in nutrients and rich in Al, Fe and Mn indicates that they can be used in the restoration of areas degraded by bauxite and iron mining, which are important mining activities in Brazil.

TI  - Physical restoration of a minesoil after 10.6 years of revegetation
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Revegetation with different plant species has been a strategy to restore the minesoil profile quality in many countries. However, restoration studies about soils degraded by surface coal mining show that it is not easy a simple task to bring back degraded/mined soil to its near original configuration. Thus, our study monitored the physical restoration of a minesoil by 10.6 years over the same experimental unit used by Pauletto et al. (2016), when the minesoil was with 4.8 years of revegetation. The study was conducted in a coal mining area in Candiota city, Southern Brazil. The minesoil was constructed in early 2003, and the experiment was set up between September/October 2007. The species analyzed were Urochloa humidicola, Panicum maximum, and Urochloa brizantha. Natural soil under native vegetation was used as a reference. In April 2018, soil samples were collected in the 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m layers, and the following soil attributes were determined: distribution of the water-stable aggregates in different size classes, tensile strength, soil organic carbon content, bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and microporosity. In addition, soil penetration resistance was measured in all exper-imental areas. The minesoil attributes improvement between 4.8 and 10.6 years occurred in depth, mainly with the cohesive aggregates breakdown, and macroporosity and soil organic carbon content increases. At 10.6 years of revegetation, all perennial grasses improved physical conditions up to 0.10 m depth of the minesoil, with good results than those observed in the natural soil. However, compaction persisted in the 0.10-0.20 m layer, as shown mainly by the higher tensile strength of the aggregates, soil penetration resistance, and bulk density.

TI  - ASSESSING PASSIVE RESTORATION OF AN ATLANTIC FOREST SITE FOLLOWING A Cupressus lusitanica MILL. PLANTATION CLEARCUTTING
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cupressus lusitanica has a relatively low potential for fostering colonization of native species beneath the forest canopy. However, following the clearcut of a Cupressus lusitanica plantation in the State Forest of Avare (SFA), southeastern Brazil, a vigorous regeneration of Atlantic forest tree and shrub species was observed. We evaluated the passive restoration of this site by comparing its regenerating vegetation to the vegetation established in man-made gaps in Atlantic forest in the State Park of Cantareira (SPC), southeastern Brazil. The frequency distribution of dispersal syndromes for species and the rate of reduction in abundance of pioneer species in a rank/abundance plot did not differ between the two areas. The rarefaction curves for species richness and diversity of the SPC fall below the corresponding curves of the SFA. The proportions of non-pioneer species and of individuals of non-pioneer species were greater in the SFA. The frequency distribution of dispersal syndromes for individuals differed between the two areas due mainly to a more conspicuous predominance of zoochory in the SFA. The rate of reduction in abundance of non-pioneer species in a rank/abundance plot was smaller in the SFA. We concluded that passive restoration may successfully recover native vegetation attributes following the clearcut of forest plantations without conspicuous regeneration of native species beneath the forest canopy. However, this phenomenon may be influenced by particular properties of the forest species, logging practices and faunal seed dispersal integrity.

TI  - Future precipitation changes and their implications for tropical peatlands
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon ( C) in tropical peatlands over Southeast Asia and Amazonia, if released to the atmosphere, can substantially increase the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Over Southeast Asia, where the most extensive tropical peatlands in the world occur, 11 climate models for the IPCC Fourth Assessment show an overall decrease of rainfall in future dry seasons. Over Amazonia, future rainfall changes in dry seasons are highly uncertain; five models predict increased rainfall, and the remaining models predict the opposite. We have further examined the UKMO-HadCM3, GISS-ER, and GFDL-CM2.1 models. Over Southeast Asia, all three models predict similar decreases of rainfall and evaporative fraction, implying an increase of water table depth and surface dryness during the dry season south of the equator. Such changes would potentially switch peat ecosystems from acting as C sinks to C sources. Over Amazonia, the two models with the best simulations of current rainfall produce conflicting results for the future of peat stability.

TI  - The potential of hay for graminoid introduction in the restoration of subtropical grasslands: Results from a greenhouse experiment
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Subtropical grasslands have been severely impacted. Due to their low resilience after degradation, active restoration is necessary; however, knowledge still is incipient. Hay transfer is a successfully employed technique to restore other grassland ecosystems and its use is promising in subtropical grasslands. We evaluated the potential of hay transfer for the restoration of the subtropical grasslands in Southern Brazil by assessing the effects of (1) the date of hay harvest and (2) the amount of dry hay used.Methods: In two protected areas in South Brazilian grasslands, we harvested hay on three dates (mid-Spring, early-Summer, and mid-Summer) and placed it into a greenhouse for seeds in the hay to germinate. Two different amounts of dry hay (375 g/m2 and 750 g/m2) were used for each date. We assessed the number of emerging seedlings, species richness, and seedling species composition in each treatment, separately for each site. Emerging forbs were identified as soil seed bank contamination, and only data for graminoids (grasses and sedges) are presented.Results: The number of seedlings varied among harvest dates, with mid-Spring and early-Summer resulting in more emergencies in both sites. No common pattern to both sites regarding the effect of the amount of dry hay on seedling emergence was found for the two sites, but interaction with the harvest date is important. Species composition and richness also varied across harvest dates, and, independent of the donor site, more hay resulted in more species. Nevertheless, few species were transferred overall.Conclusions: Hay transfer has the potential to introduce seeds of graminoids and appears to be a promising tool for the restoration of South Brazilian grasslands. There is not a single optimal time for hay harvest nor a pattern regarding hay amount. Few species are established from hay and more than one harvest should be done to increase species richness.

TI  - The seed rain as an environmental indicator of areas in the ecological restoration process of Mato Grosso do Sul state
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The seed rain (SR) is characterized by the arrival of propagules to the soil, caused by dispersion mechanisms and is essential to the natural regeneration dynamics of forests. The objective was to evaluate SR as an indicator of three restoration areas in the municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Ivinhema 12 years (IV-12), Jatef 13 years (JA-13) e Caarapo 16 years of planting (CA-16). Fifteen 0.64 m(2) collectors were randomly installed in each area and the material collected monthly from May 2015 to January 2016. The Shannon index (H') and Pielou Equability (J') were calculated and the seeds classified as dispersion syndrome, habit and successional class of tree species seeds. A total of 47,124 propagules were identified. For CA-16, 27.033 seeds, 29 families, 39 genera and 41 species were sampled. The JA-13 obtained 8,056 seeds, 22 families, 32 genera and 33 species. The area IV-12 resulted in 12,035 seeds, 13 families, 21 genera and 22 species. From the 61 species found, 88.5% are arboreal. Referring to the dispersion syndrome, most are zoochoric, with emphasis on IV-12 with 93.7%, being 40.9% allochthonous and from animals. Concerning to the successional class, the pioneers were prominent, mainly for the IV-12 (91.7%). The SR can be considered a good indicator for assessing the environmental integrity of areas in restoration by providing subsidies for understanding the maintenance of ecological processes, since in the evaluated areas, most of the seeds were zoochoric species, with expressive contribution of allochthonous species, demonstrating the existence of a dispersal fauna facilitating the forest succession.

TI  - Shannon tree diversity is a surrogate for mineland rehabilitation status
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineland rehabilitation is performed to reduce the overall impacts of mining operations. Thus, statistically validated and easily measurable indicators are necessary to monitor the environmental status along time, enhance the rehabilitation process, and increase institutional tractability. The objective of this study is to derive an effective indicator to assess the environmental quality of iron mining waste piles undergoing rehabilitation in the Caraj acute accent as National Forest, eastern Amazon, Brazil, from a curated set of field-surveyed environmental variables related to vegetation structure, invertebrate and vegetation compositions, diversity, and ecological processes. Data were collected from a chronosequence that included non-revegetated areas, areas in different rehabilitation stages and natural reference sites. All variables were integrated to produce a single estimate of rehabilitation status using a multivariate approach. Individual variables largely differed in their response ratios; nevertheless, the data integration showed that more than 50% of the predisturbance ecosystem structure, diversity and functioning were restituted after only seven years, which highlights the potential of rehabilitation activities to effectively reduce mining impacts. Among all 27 variables, the Shannon index of tree diversity had the highest predictive power for overall rehabilitation status, qualifying this metric as the most effective indicator for the use in future comprehensive monitoring activities in waste piles undergoing rehabilitation in the Caraj acute accent as National Forest. The positive relationship between tree diversity and mineland rehabilitation status in the examined areas emphasizes the importance of diverse tree communities in increasing rehabilitation success and ecosystem and soil functioning over short time periods.

TI  - Deforestation and Avian Extinction on Tropical Landbridge Islands
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are few empirical data, particularly collected simultaneously from multiple sites, on extinctions resulting from human-driven land-use change. Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate in the world, but the resulting losses of biological diversity remain poorly documented. Between November 2006 and March 2008, we conducted bird surveys on six landbridge islands in Malaysia and Indonesia. These islands were surveyed previously for birds in the early 1900s, when they were extensively forested. Our bird inventories of the islands were nearly complete, as indicated by sampling saturation curves and nonparametric true richness estimators. From zero (Pulau Malawali and Pulau Mantanani) to 15 (Pulau Bintan) diurnal resident landbird species were apparently extirpated since the early 1900s. Adding comparable but published extinction data from Singapore to our regression analyses, we found there were proportionally fewer forest bird extinctions in areas with greater remaining forest cover. Nevertheless, the statistical evidence to support this relationship was weak, owing to our unavoidably small sample size. Bird species that are restricted to the Indomalayan region, lay few eggs, are heavier, and occupy a narrower habitat breadth, were most vulnerable to extinction on Pulau Bintan. This was the only island where sufficient data existed to analyze the correlates of extinction. Forest preservation and restoration are needed on these islands to conserve the remaining forest avifauna. Our study of landbridge islands indicates that deforestation may increasingly threaten Southeast Asian biodiversity.

TI  - Implementing forest landscape restoration in Latin America: Stakeholder perceptions on legal frameworks
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Legal frameworks could play a key role in enabling countries to meet their ambitious forest landscape restoration (FLR) targets. In this paper, we examine the perceptions of different types of stakeholders from 17 Latin American countries on aspects of forestry and environmental legal frameworks that enable or hamper FLR interventions at the national level. We first reviewed general, environmental, social and financial aspects of existing legal frameworks in order to provide the basis for a mixed qualitative - quantitative analysis of perceptions. The analysis combines information from semi-structured interviews and a Likert-scale questionnaire given to relevant stakeholders involved in implementing FLR interventions in the countries assessed. We interviewed stakeholders from government, academia, national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local private and non-governmental organizations. We found that most legal frameworks are in the jurisdiction of either the agriculture or the environmental sectors. As a whole, we did not find evidence of the kind of legal frameworks articulation needed to enable the coordinated deployment of various forest FLR interventions across landscapes. We found efforts in Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico to improve crosssectorial communication and legislation, and to develop innovative financial mechanisms to support FLR interventions. In general, interviewees had a positive perception of the content of legal frameworks in their countries; however, they highlighted weak implementation capacities, insufficient funding, sectorial and social conflicts, and lack of transparency as key impediments for policy implementation. Academic and NGO stakeholders perceived the content of the legal frameworks more negatively, whereas government officials were more positive. Different perceptions and the prevalence of cross-sectorial conflicts highlight the importance of efforts aimed at improving governance mechanisms and policy integration in the region. In addition, a targeted effort is needed to develop long-term, funding options that are public, private or mixed, and to disseminate information on the importance of FLR interventions for national economies and human well-being. We consider our results as a preliminary overview of the legal environment for FLR implementation in Latin America.

TI  - Low light availability affects leaf gas exchange, growth and survival of Euterpe edulis seedlings transplanted into the understory of an anthropic tropical rainforest
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae) is a threatened palm tree of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest understory with fundamental importance for the restoration of degraded forest environments. We assessed the leaf gas exchange, growth and survival of E. edulis seedlings transplanted at three different forest sites (S1, S2 and S3) in the same area in which cocoa trees had been cultivated in a rustic agroforestry system. Measurement was carried out during the first year after seedling transplantation. The sites were characterised according to canopy openness (CO) and total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Average CO and PPFD values were 13.3%, 8.0% and 6.7%, and 3.34, 2.79 and 0.62 mol m(-2) d(-1) for S1, S2 and S3, respectively. A progressive decline in seedling survival was observed in all sites throughout the experiment. At 387 d after planting, survival at S1, S2 and S3 was 57%, 44% and 37%, respectively. The gross light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), leaf area and plant biomass were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in S1 and S2 when compared with S3. The values of dark respiration rate (R-d) and photosynthetic compensation irradiance (I-c) were sufficiently low for a positive carbon balance. Notwithstanding, the interpretation of results of microclimate variables together with leaf gas exchange and growth variables indicated that seedlings at all sites were in a suboptimal condition to achieve A(max), which is probably the main cause of the dramatic decline in the seedlings' survival throughout the first year after transplantation. From a practical point of view, if the values of CO and PFD are lower than 10% and 3 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, it is suggested that the transplanting of E. edulis seedlings to the understory of abandoned agroforestry systems be accompanied by cultural practices, such as the thinning and pruning of tree tops.

TI  - Assessing Genetic Diversity after Mangrove Restoration in Brazil: Why Is It So Important?
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vital for many marine and terrestrial species, and several other environmental services, such as carbon sink areas, the mangrove ecosystem is highly threatened due to the proximity of large urban centers and climate change. The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations. Moreover, while restoration efforts have increased, few studies have analyzed how recently-planted areas impact the original mangrove genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Araca Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Restoration over time: is it possible to restore trees and non-trees in high-diversity forests?
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsDo different growth forms have distinct temporal patterns of recovery of their structure, diversity, and composition in restored Atlantic Rain forest? Are tree and non-tree assemblages structured by the same factors?LocationAtlantic Rain Forest, restored by planting an assemblage of high-diversity tree species, Brazil.MethodsWe measured plant colonization of restoration sites of different ages to evaluate restoration success in terms of species diversity, colonization by non-tree species and structure measures among stands. We used Procrustes analysis to test whether the same conditions that influence tree composition influence non-tree composition (congruence between non-trees and trees present on the same sites).ResultsMany structural aspects of recovering forests, e.g. tree basal area, canopy cover, height, tree richness, and non-tree floristic composition resembled a mature forest within five decades. Although tree species diversity increased according to restoration age of sites, planted sites did not recover the richness of all growth forms even after five decades of restoration, and particularly lacked climbers and epiphytes. We detected significant similarity between corresponding points (tree and non-tree composition) from separate ordinations only in the reference forest. Therefore, naturally assembled communities are more concordant than those originating from active restoration.ConclusionNon-tree assemblages respond to different factors than the tree assemblages in restoration sites. Hence, non-tree recovery may not result as a natural consequence of tree recovery, and specific restoration strategies for non-tree species must be applied. Tree richness recovered after two decades. Only half of the non-tree species richness was recovered in old restoration sites, but their composition similarity reached expected levels of reference values. Further studies will investigate if low richness of non-tree species is a consequence of low input of allochthonous propagules (landscape filter) or whether they are arriving but not establishing (environmental filter). Enrichment planting of non-tree species may be required if the problem is propagule input. We recommend enrichment planting should be implemented within 10yrs after initial restoration planting because of the need for trees as supporting structures. However, if propagules are arriving but not establishing, the solution is to detect which environmental filters are important and to manipulate them through forest management.

TI  - Natural forest management and conservation of biodiversity in tropical forests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As a reaction to the continued dwindling of tropical forest resources, many research and development organizations have turned to the idea of natural forest management in the hope of making tropical forest lands more profitable while maintaining biodiversity. Assertions of sustainability in logging practices have been inadequately supported, however. We begin with a review of the present knowledge of the effects of logging operations on various organisms. Post-harvest surveys of a spectrum of tropical forests indicate a range of logging effects from local extirpation to substantial increases in local densities of some species. The state of knowledge does not permit quantitative predictions, but logging at any level appears to have simplifying and homogenizing effects on tropical forest diversity when examined at community or regional scales. Furthermore, the social and economic problems presented by natural forest management systems have not yet been adequately addressed. We present alternatives to the strong emphasis on "sustainable natural forest management" as a means of retaining the diversity of tropical forest communities. These alternatives include increased support for management of secondary forests, restoration of degraded lands, plantation forestry, nontimber uses for some forests, changes in accounting procedures to reflect the true value of natural forests, and support for forestry agencies charged with protecting forest reserves.

TI  - Reforestation and Recovery of Soil Chemical and Physical Attributes
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective with this study was to evaluate the influence of reforestation with native species from seasonal semideciduous forest, eucalyptus plantation, and pasture in the soil chemical and physical properties of degraded areas. Five sites were selected in the watershed of the Aguapei River in the Garca city, Sao Paulo state: two reforestation areas with native species, with four and nine years old; a reforestation area with eucalyptus plantation, a pasture area, and a forest fragment used as control. The forest fragment presented the lowest exangeable bases and the highest levels of P,SOC and CEC; it also showed the lowest penetration resistance, and the largest diameter and aggregate stability. The chemical and physical soil attributes of the reforestation areas differed from those of the forest fragment (control), showing that the recovery period was not sufficient to restore these attributes. However, the 9-year-old reforestation area presented significant improvement of these soil attributes, tending to approach those of the control area.

TI  - Incorporating habitat availability into systematic planning for restoration: a species-specific approach for Atlantic Forest mammals
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - AimSpecies persistence often depends not only on habitat protection, but also on habitat restoration. The effectiveness of species conservation through habitat restoration can be enhanced by explicitly considering habitat availability', the combined effects of the total amount of habitat and its spatial configuration. We develop an approach for prioritizing land for restoration in a complex biome, considering habitat availability, land acquisition cost and biogeographical representation.LocationBrazilian Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe evaluate alternative restoration prioritization strategies for two mammal species with widely different dispersal abilities and habitat patch requirements. Our strategies focused on minimizing cost while meeting targets for biogeographical subregion representation and habitat availability metrics. We evaluated solutions based on the expected post-restoration improvement in habitat availability per unit cost.ResultsRestoration through land acquisition to improve habitat availability for both species and to ensure 20% forest cover within each of the Atlantic Forest biogeographical subregions would cost US$ 17.5-20.5 billion. The 12.6 and 11.4 million ha of restored forest resulted in an increase of 10.5% and 9.8% in habitat area and 5518% (55-fold) and 4100% (41-fold) in future habitat availability for Leopardus pardalis and Caluromys philander, respectively. We found a high degree of concordance (>75%) among selected planning units for each species.Main conclusionSubstantial improvements in habitat availability that benefit both species can be realized for minimal additional cost relative to solutions based solely on cost-minimization and biogeographical subregion representation. We demonstrate that metrics based on metapopulation theory can be quantified in complex systems and used in a systematic restoration prioritization approach to improve habitat availability cost-effectively. Concordance among priority areas for restoration for species with widely different dispersal abilities and habitat patch requirements supports the idea that many species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest might benefit from plans based on indicator species. This is particularly useful in data-deficient systems like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - The diversity of post-fire regeneration strategies in the cerrado ground layer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disentangling species strategies that confer resilience to natural disturbances is key to conserving and restoring savanna ecosystems. Fire is a recurrent disturbance in savannas, and savanna vegetation is highly adapted to and often dependent on fire. However, although the woody component of tropical savannas is well studied, we still do not understand how ground-layer plant communities respond to fire, limiting conservation and management actions. We investigated the effects of prescribed fire on community structure and composition, and evaluated which traits are involved in plant community regeneration after fire in the cerrado ground layer. We assessed traits related to species persistence and colonization capacity after fire, including resprouter type, underground structure, fire-induced flowering, regeneration strategy and growth form. We searched for functional groups related to response to fire, to shed light on the main strategies of post-fire recovery among species in the ground layer. Fire changed ground-layer community structure and composition in the short term, leading to greater plant species richness, population densities and increasing bare soil, compared with unburned communities. Eight months after fire, species abundance did not differ from pre-disturbance values for 86% of the species, demonstrating the resilience of this layer to fire. Only one ruderal species was disadvantaged by fire and 13% of the species benefited. Rapid recovery of soil cover by native vegetation in burned areas was driven by species with high capacity to resprout and spread vegetatively. Recovery of the savanna ground-layer community, as a whole, resulted from a combination of different species traits. We summarized these traits into five large groups, encompassing key strategies involved in ground-layer regeneration after fire. Synthesis. Fire dramatically changes the ground layer of savanna vegetation in the short term, but the system is highly resilient, quickly recovering the pre-fire state. Recovery involves different strategies, which we categorized into five functional groups of plant species:grasses,seeders,bloomers,undergroundersandresprouters. Knowledge of these diverse strategies should be used as a tool to assess conservation and restoration status of fire-resilient ecosystems in the cerrado.

TI  - Following a site-specific secondary succession in the Amazon using the Landsat CDR product and field inventory data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests cover large areas and are strong carbon sinks in tropical regions. They are important for ecosystem functioning, biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and recovery of soil fertility. In this study, we used the Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) product from 16 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat-5 images (1984-2010) to continuously track the secondary succession (SS) of a forest following land abandonment in 1980. Changes in canopy structure and floristic composition were analysed using data from four field inventories (1995, 2002, 2007, and 2012). To characterize variations in brightness, greenness, spectral reflectance, and shadows with the natural regeneration of vegetation, we applied tasselled cap transformations, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear spectral mixture models to the TM datasets. Shade fractions were plotted over time and correlated with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Because image texture may reflect the variability of the successional process, eight co-occurrence-based filter metrics were calculated for selected TM bands and plotted as a function of time since abandonment. The successional forest was compared to a nearby primary reference forest (PF) and had differences in the spectral and textural means evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed increases of 35% and 10.4% over time in basal area and tree height, respectively. Species richness within the assemblage of sampling units increased from 14 to 71 between 1995 and 2012, and this trend was also confirmed using an individual-based rarefaction analysis. Species richness in 2012 was still lower than that observed in the PF site, which presented greater amounts of aboveground biomass (336.4 + 17.0 ton ha(-1) for PF versus 98.5 + 21.4 ton ha(-1) for SS in 2012). Brightness and greenness tasselled cap differences between the SS and PF rapidly decreased from 1984 (SS at the age of 4 years) to 1991 (age of 11 years). Brightness also decreased from 1997 to 2003, as indicated by PC1 scores and surface reflectance of the TM bands 4 (near infrared) and 5 (shortwave infrared). Spectral mixture shade fraction increased from young to old successional stages with strata composition and canopy structure development, whereas NDVI and EVI decreased over time. Because EVI was strongly dependent on near infrared reflectance (r = + 0.96), it was also much more strongly correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93) than NDVI. Except for the image texture mean that decreased from young to old successional stages in TM bands 4 and 5, no clear trend was observed in the remaining texturemetrics over the time period of vegetation regeneration. Overall, due to structural-floristic and spectral/textural differences with the PF, the SS site was still distinguishable using Landsat data 30 years after land abandonment. Most of the spectral metric means between PF and SS were significantly different over time at 0.01 significance level, as indicated by ANOVA.

TI  - Present and future distribution of endangered and economically important Ocotea species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Implications for conservation and restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to global biodiversity. Economically important species are even more susceptible to these drivers, as their already vulnerable populations experience additional stress. This is exemplified by species such as Ocotea catharinensis , O. odorifera , and O. porosa , which have been extensively exploited and are mainly found in the highly degraded Atlantic Forest hotspot. In this context, this study aimed to assess the effects of climate change on the distribution of these species and identify priority areas to support conservation and restoration measures. The MaxEnt algorithm was employed to estimate the current and future distribution of the three species under two time periods (2040 and 2080) and climate change scenarios (SSP 245 and SSP 585). The obtained information was then used to assess land use change within the species distribution range, focusing on suitable regions within legally protected areas and on lands that need to be restored to comply with the Brazilian forest code. The analysis revealed that habitat loss, particularly due to forest conversion for forestry use, remains a significant threat to these species. Furthermore, climate change is projected to cause reductions in suitable habitats for all species. The predicted reduction ranges from 32% to 67% for O. catharinensis , 39 -86% for O. odorifera , and 26 -69% for O. porosa , depending on the year and climate change scenario. These results indicate a potential worsening of their conservation status in the coming years. A concerning mismatch was observed between the conservation target and legally protected suitable areas in future scenarios, particularly affecting O. catharinensis and O. porosa . Additionally, a significant portion of the suitable areas falls within lands that require restoration. Our findings highlight climate change as an additional risk factor for the conservation of these already endangered species. The results provided by this study can support the development of ex situ and in situ conservation strategies aiming at safeguarding these ecologically and economically valuable species.

T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to analyze the Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) of Santo Antonio River, at Santo Antonio Colony settlement according to the implemented changes in the forestry code. Three rural areas were analyzed in this settlement, they are considered of small and medium size. The study area, as well as studied rural areas and PPA, were delimited from the online images database of Quantum GIS software with free use license. Among available images in this database it was chosen the one from satellite GeoEye 1 of high spatial resolution (1.65 m), obtained from Google Earth open layers plugin. The results show that there are serious problems for compliance with the forestry legislation. It was identified ranges of PPA with lack of riparian vegetation and therefore erosive problems or being used as pasture and as animal water supply. At the end, it was proposed recovery of these places with restoration and isolation techniques through planting native arboreal vegetation or natural regeneration, as well as implementing projects with the assistance of rural producers through Agroforestry Systems (SAFs).

TI  - Frugivore diversity increases evenness in the seed rain on deforested tropical landscapes
T2  - OIKOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of tropical forests is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions involving plants and frugivores that disperse their seeds. However, it is little known how decreases in the diversity of frugivores can affect seed dispersal patterns, plant community composition and species' coexistence in tropical forest landscapes. Here, we investigated the effects of bird frugivore diversity on seed dispersal of rare plant species and on the magnitude of equalizing effects on the seed rain in open areas within 12 fragmented landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the production of bird-dispersed seeds and bird abundance in forest fragments, and sampled the seed rain and the activity of birds attracted to experimental tree nuclei established in neighboring pastures. The activity of frugivores in tree nuclei was positively correlated with the diversity of birds recorded in nearby forest fragments, and the seed rain diversity increased with frugivore activity. The proportion of seeds dispersed more frequently than expected by chance in tree nuclei increased linearly with the species' richness of birds. The richness and abundance of active frugivores in deforested areas promoted a seed rain with evenness and diversity up to five times greater than the seed pool available in forest fragments due to the proportional increase in the dispersal of rare plant species and a concomitant proportional decrease in the dispersal of dominant fruiting plants. Furthermore, every additional bird species detected in a site was associated with a 10% increase in the equalizing effect on dispersed seeds' relative abundance. Our results show that the aggregated behavior of avian frugivore communities on deforested areas results in higher species richness in the seed rain of plant communities and underscore the urgency to reduce bird species' loss and the simplification of their communities in tropical landscapes.

TI  - Vegetative and Environmental Components in a Secondary Riparian Forest in the Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the vegetation and environmental variable of fragments at different successional stages in a secondary riparian forest in the municipality of Ponte Alta, Santa Catarina state, Brazil (27 degrees 29'00 '' S and 50 degrees 17'11 '' W, WGS84), aiming to list priority variables for monitoring forest succession in riparian forests. For this, two areas were identified: "Reference" (conserved secondary forest) and "Restoration" (secondary forest under passive restoration). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated the existence of differences in the arboreal community diversity with lower values for the "Restoration" synthesized by PC1. The ground coverage by Ocellochloa rudis (Nees) Zuloaga & Morrone ( Poaceae) was mainly in places with higher pH values and ability for effective cation exchange, with no preference of occurrence in either evaluated site. The composition of arboreal diversity was a relevant variable for monitoring passive restoration in this environment.

TI  - Past and present conservation of south American estuaries
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - South America possesses a variety of estuaries along both tropical and temperate coastal regions, with most of these systems facing uncontrolled urban settlement and industrial development pressures. This review examines the contamination of estuaries on the continent with metals, persistent organic pollutants, and solid wastes, as well as their accumulation and transference through the trophic web. Moreover, we emphasize that the damming of rivers, dredging of estuaries, and deforestation of catchments results in alterations to the natural river flow and habitat losses, thus disrupting ecoclinal gradients and impairing the ability of estuarine fauna to move across connected ecosystems. We highlight how the loss in estuarine biodiversity and complexity has diminished biotic resilience and increased the potential for natural 'disasters. It is also apparent that conservation actions are urgently required before environmental modifications exceed the capacity of estuarine ecosystems to recover from such major perturbations. We document that developing continents with many developing countries, such as South America, require legislation to support a healthy environment, and that more attention needs to be devoted to the social, economic and cultural aspects of traditional communities. We emphasize that plans and actions aimed at estuarine conservation must be based on consistent and statistically testable data that covers natural flow regimes, cycles of environmental contamination, and their influences on estuarine organisms. Environmental protection initiatives for South American estuaries are still in their infancy and steps are required to promote their protection by reducing untreated wastewater disposal, managing exploitation of resources, using stakeholder and co-management approaches, introducing restoration protocols, and improving habitat protection.

TI  - Accounting for seedling performance from nursery to outplanting when reforesting degraded tropical peatlands
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation is promoted to address the dual global climate and biodiversity crises. This is particularly relevant for carbon-rich, biodiverse tropical peatlands, for which active reforestation typically involves two post-germination stages: nursery rearing of seedlings, then outplanting. Yet, linkages between these stages and cumulative seedling performance are rarely quantified during tropical peatland reforestation. By monitoring tree seedling survival and growth, we investigate factors influencing seedling performance (species identity, seedling source, treatments, and climate), whether nursery performance predicts outplanting performance, and calculate cumulative survival (nursery plus outplanting) in Sebangau National Park, Indonesian Borneo. Standardized survival at 2 years was higher in the nursery (mean 67% across 40 species) than outplanting (44% across 24 species). For nursery and outplanting, species identity was the main source of variation in survival and height growth. Seedling source, treatments, site condition, and precipitation had no significant impact on survival but did influence growth in some cases. Nursery survival did not predict outplanting survival, but nursery height did predict outplanting height. Across species, around a quarter of seedlings survived from nursery to outplanting over 4 years. Cumulative survival represents a more realistic basis for assessing the genetic and other resource costs of tropical peatland reforestation. Our two-phase approach identified outplanting as the greater bottleneck to cumulative seedling survivability. We argue that the nursery stage may be used to harden seedlings for degraded peatland conditions by selecting more relevant treatments (e.g. flooding) and screening for resilience to common disturbances (e.g. fire) to enhance outplanted, and thus cumulative, seedling survival.

TI  - INDICATED SPECIES TO RESTORATION OF RIPARIAN FORESTS IN SUBWATERSHED OF PEIXE-BOI RIVER, PARA STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to indicate native species to be used in the restoration of degraded riparian forests in the subwatershed of Peixe-Boi river. All trees and shrubs with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 5 cm were inventoried in ten areas of secondary forest and six areas of igapo forest. The results were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and the silviculture of the species was assessed by literature review. In Igapo areas 66 species were found; the areas had low richness and low diversity index of Shannon, when compared with data from the secondary forests. The floristic composition was heterogeneous, and the floristic similarity is higher between areas that are closer geographically. In the secondary forests were found 175 species; the areas showed high abundance of individuals, high species richness, diversity and evenness. Secondary forests were separated according to geographic proximity and age, which is directly linked to the successional stage. The PCA analysis established the ecological importance of 29 tree species; however only ten species had enough silvicultural information. Due to a greater ecological importance and viable silvicultural techniques available in the literature, Carapa guianensis, Pachira aquatica, Spondias mombin, Tapirira guianensis and Virola guianensis are the most suitable species to restore the degraded areas, in association with Inga edulis, Jacaranda copaia, Pseudopiptadenia psilostachya, Simarouba amara and Vismia guianensis of the secondary forests, that can be planted in the borders and in the nearby areas of igapo forests.

TI  - DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGES AND VOLUME OF WOOD PHYTOMASS OF Cassia siamea LAM STEMS CUT FOR Coccoderus novempunctatus (COLEOPTERA: CERAMBYCIDAE)
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerambycids that promote breaking of branches or stems may cause damage to several forest species, in economical plantings or even in trees used in urban afforestation. Coccoderus novempunctatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is one of these cases. The damage accomplished by the larvae propitiates the fall branches of many forest species, and in the case evaluated in this study, can cause fall of Cassia siamea stems or part of these. Cassia siamea is a forest specie used in afforestation and in recovery of ecologically disturbed areas. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the damages caused by C. novempunctatus on C. siamea through lesions diagnoses and volume quantification of wood of stems sectioned by it. Five plots were demarcated in a secondary forest where the insect action had been registered. C. siamea stems cut by insect had their diameter in the cut point measured as well as total length. Wood volumes were calculated by using the Smalian method. Average diameter in the cut point, and the average length of C. siamea stems cut by C. novempunctatus was 9.07 cm and 6.31 m, respectively. Average wood volume of these stems with and without bark was 0.0261 and 0.0218 m(3), respectively.

TI  - Wading through the Luyon-luyon: social perspectives on the tropical peatlands of the Leyte Sab-a Basin, Philippines
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Peatland restoration is considered as one of the most cost-effective interventions for climate mitigation and adaptation, sustaining local welfare and livelihoods, and building climate resilience of local communities. Yet, there is often a diversity of views and goals of restoring tropical peatlands. While technical approaches dominate peatland restoration literature, this study introduces a novel social-ecological framework that analyzed the value-driven priorities that shape restoration goals. Based on semi-structured interviews with 14 key informants and six focus groups with development agencies, local governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities, participants highlight key issues in restoring peatlands, often influenced by the socioeconomic and historical context in which they are positioned. These results exemplify specific objectives for restoration in developing countries with relatively smaller yet equally important peatlands. The study's novelty lies in applying sense-making and value-centric approaches to tropical peatland restoration, contributing to discourse by demonstrating how diverse social perspectives and values critically shape restoration outcomes, an underrepresented dimension in predominantly technical restoration literature.

TI  - Surface runoff in six years of rehabilitation of two areas after bauxite mining in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of surface runoff pre-mining and during six years of rehabilitation with Eucalyptus plantation, postmining, in bauxite mining areas was the central objective of this work. Surface runoff was monitored from January to May before mining and in the same months from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation, being collected in seven plots in two bauxite mining areas in southeastern Brazil. The factors that interfere with runoff were characterized in all periods, statistically compared by the Wilcoxon test and submitted to principal component analysis (PCA). The total surface runoff in the five months before mining was 1.74 to 14.06 times greater than the runoff in the same months in the six years of rehabilitation. The average percentage runoff was <1% of the precipitation in all rehabilitation periods, in contrast before mining 1.3% of the precipitation of 556 mm became surface runoff. The highest slopes of the regression were for the first year of rehabilitation and for the pre-mining period, showing a greater influence of precipitation on the generation of surface runoff. Soil, litter and vegetation characteristics were the most explanatory factors in the six-year PCA. Specific factors must be viewed with caution on micro scale in each year of rehabilitation of surface bauxite mines, due to soil heterogeneity and consequent vegetation, seeking to minimize the negative effects on surface runoff. Gap in knowledge about surface runoff percentages in six years of rehabilitation in Brazil and tropical areas was filled. Mine managers can more clearly define the priority factors in strategies to mitigate the effects of mining on the environment from the first to the sixth year of rehabilitation in surface mined areas.

TI  - Local and ecoregion effects on fish assemblage structure in tributaries of the Rio Paraiba do Sul, Brazil
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the effects of physical and chemical habitat variables and ecoregions on species occurrence and fish assemblage structure in streams of the Paraiba do Sul basin, in southeast Brazil.Fish and environmental data were collected from 42 sites on 26 first to fourth order streams (1 : 50 000 map scale) in three ecoregions. The sites occurred in one valley and two plateau ecoregions at altitudes of 40-1080 m and distances of 0.1-188 km from the main channel of the Rio Paraiba do Sul. Physical habitat (substratum, riparian cover, habitat types) and water quality (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and conductivity) variables were measured at each sampling site.A total of 2684 individuals in 16 families and 59 species were recorded.Ecoregion was a better predictor of the fish assemblage than the other environmental variables, according to the differences between the mean within-class and mean between-class similarities in assemblage data.Differing landscape characteristics were associated with differing local variables and thereby with differing fish assemblage structures. Riffles, shrub, grass, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and temperature were closely related to fish assemblage structure.Fish assemblages in sites far from the main river and at higher altitudes also differed from those near the Paraiba do Sul main channel, presumably as a result of differences in connectivity, covarying environmental factors and anthropogenic influence.These results reinforce the importance of understanding how stream communities are influenced by processes and patterns operating at local and regional scales, which will aid water resource managers to target those factors in their management and rehabilitation efforts.

TI  - Assessing entomological collection data to build pollen interaction networks in the tropical Amazon forest
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interactions between species are the driving force behind ecological dynamics within communities. For this reason, community structure has been described as networks of interacting species for over a century. However, the high canopies in forests such as the tropical Amazon pose an additional challenge to understand interactions. The main objective of the present study is to infer the interactions between bees and plants collected in the Carajas National Forest (Eastern Amazon) and its surroundings from the analysis of pollen loads from bee specimens deposited in biological collections and to determine the trophic niches of the evaluated bee species. This study also aims to contribute to the restoration planning of deforested areas in the eastern Amazon by identifying priority plant species that could help in restoring interaction networks. Pollen loads samples were collected from bees deposited in two entomological collections. The samples obtained were prepared according to Erdtman's acetolysis method, and the pollen grains were counted, measured and microphotographed. We found 154 bee-plant interactions. The pollen material identified in the 72 bee samples (51 species; 16 genera) showed 82 pollen types (plant taxa), distributed in 28 families and 54 genera, with 43 fully identified species and three indeterminate pollen types. The amplitudes of the trophic niche indicated that the genera Trigona, Centris and Xylocopa had more diverse diets. This work also emphasizes the importance of understanding the plant species that make up the diets of bees for management, conservation and restoration strategies.

TI  - Bird community structure in riparian environments in Cai River, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
T2  - Biotemas
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization produces changes in riparian environments, causing effects in the structure of bird communities, which present different responses to the impacts. We compare species richness, abundance, and composition of birds in riparian environments with different characteristics in Cai River, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We carried out observations in woodland, grassland, and urban environments, between September 2007 and August 2008. We listed 130 bird species, 29 species unique to woodland environment, and an endangered species: Triclaria malachitacea. Bird abundance differed from woodland (n = 426 individuals) to urban environments (n = 939 individuals) (F2,6 = 7.315; P = 0.025). Species composition and feeding guilds differed significantly in the bird community structures among these three riparian environments. In the grassland and urban environments there were more generalist insectivorous species, while in the woodland environments we find more leaf and trunk insectivorous species and frugivorous species, sensitive to human impacts. Bird species can be biological quality indicators and they contribute to ecosystems performing relevant functions. With the knowledge on bird community structure and their needs, it is possible to implement management practices for restoration of degraded riparian environments.

TI  - Forest tree dynamics from the first four years of permanent plot in Mount Papandayan, Indonesia: mortality, recruitment, and growth
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A permanent plot is a powerful tool to study the vegetation???s dynamics and regeneration in the forest ecosystem. This study presents the first four-year tree vegetation monitoring in a one-hectare permanent plot established in a mixed forest of Mount Papandayan (MP) Nature Reserve, Indonesia. Besides studying the structure and floristic tree community composition in the plot, this study aims to study the changes and in mortality and growth of the tree community after four years of plot establishment. A one-hectare permanent plot was established in 2010 and all trees inside the plot with a diameter over 5 cm were tagged and measured in 2011 and 2015. There were 1,820 trees from 33 species and 20 families recorded during the first monitoring in 2011. Four years later, there were more trees recorded (1,845 trees) with an average growth rate of 1.17 cm. The mortality rate (2.8%) was lower than the recruitment rate (4.2%) and there were no changes in the domination of Distylium stellare. The results of this study will help to provide the preliminary data on actual in situ tree mortality and growth, which will help to develop a more complete tree species selection criteria for MP restoration.

TI  - Priority areas for restoration in permanent preservation areas of rural properties in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental degradation, over the years, has drastically changed landscapes in the Amazon. At the same time, discussion, knowledge, and actions on the conservation of forest remnants and restoration of degraded environments have increased worldwide. The present study, carried out in Paragominas (Brazilian Amazon), aimed: (1) to evaluate the process of landscape change over the last 36 years (1984-2020); (2) to identify degraded environments within legally established permanent preservation areas (PPAs); and (3) to map environmental liabilities in degraded rural properties which, according to environmental regulations, must be recovered. The priority areas for restoration were defined considering (a) the environmental liabilities of each rural property; (b) the remnant forest in each rural property; (c) the rural properties' boundaries; and (d) the degraded PPAs in each rural property. Deforestation followed by land use change in Paragominas' territory increased from 12% (2336 km(2)) in 1984-45% (8783 km(2)) in 2020. The municipality presented 4416 km of rivers and c.a 6157 springs under pressure (i.e. agriculture, pasture, urban areas and deforested areas). The environmental liabilities identified summed 638.85 km(2), which, according to environmental regulations, must be recovered. It is important to consider that when producers protect PPAs in their properties, they also conserve soil and water resources as well as contribute to biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - In order to evaluate the regeneration of a forest remnant, we installed 256 2 x 2 m plots for measuring forest species individuals with height >= 30 cm and stem diameter <= 1 cm. Horizontal structure was evaluated and calculated by the Shannon (H') diversity index and the Pielou (J) evenness index. We performed clustering analysis by the agglomerative and divisive hierarchical method (the variable was the number of individuals); and used the Principal Component Analysis to verify the species distribution. We sampled 3021 individuals, distributed in 26 families and 51 species (H' = 2.78 and J = 0.66). Allophylus edulis had the highest values of absolute frequency (63.3) and absolute density (5186 ind.ha-1), while Ligustrum lucidum presented greater dissimilarity. The analysis showed the presence of regeneration mechanisms, and evidenced biological invasion problem.

TI  - A comparative analysis on water quality in an urban micro watershed
T2  - MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - This study presents a comparative analysis of water quality data in an urban micro watershed to study the magnitude of impacts on the water quality parameters over the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the degree of deterioration using the water quality index.Design/methodology/approach - Rapid urban growth without proper land use and occupation planning results in the overload of urban water resources. Therefore, a literature review was conducted on the research subject published in the dissertation databases of the Engineering Faculty of Ilha Solteira, which resulted in the selection of two dissertations on water quality in the Ipe Stream, Ilha Solteira - SP, Brazil. The results will be evaluated according to the Brazilian laws and regulations in force.Findings - This study shows that pollution and degradation in the stream intensified during the study period, with the most impacted areas within the urban perimeter. Practical implications - The increasing impacts underscore the need for efficient measures such as implementation of retention reservoirs, elimination of clandestine sewage connections and restoration of riparian forests.Originality/value - This study highlights the need to monitor the water quality of streams in order to establish preventive and mitigating measures to avert the growing environmental impacts and to ensure quality water for future generations.

TI  - Morphometric analysis of soil aggregates in mined areas at different stages of recovery in the Amazon
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining has a strong influence on the Brazilian economy, however, extractive activity results in multiple damages to the ecosystem, as vegetation and the surface layer of the soil are removed, altering the natural pedological characteristics. Therefore, programs for the recovery of degraded areas become essential to mitigate or compensate for negative impacts on the environment. In this way, the understanding of soil quality indicators has been worked on to evaluate the process of recovery of degraded areas. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop and test a new approach to qualify the recovery of soil aggregation and reference ecosystems in the Brazilian Amazon (RO). For this, the geometric mean diameter (DMG) and the morphometric parameters: area, circularity, roundness and Feret diameter of the soil aggregates were determined. The parameters were evaluated in five different aggregate sizes, 6.0 mm, 4.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.0 mm and 0.71 mu m, then multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed, comparing the morphometric variables and aggregate sizes from each study area. The results obtained show a positive correlation between the values of area, circularity and Feret diameter of soil aggregates, indicating improvements in soil structure and vegetation. In this way, the proposed parameters demonstrated a high capacity to describe the soil quality and differentiate the recovery levels, presenting itself as an excellent indicator in the monitoring of degraded areas.

TI  - Can Coral Reef Restoration Programmes Facilitate Changes in Environmental Attitudes? A Case Study on a Rural Fisher Community in North Bali, Indonesia
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently limited research assessing the ecological potential of coral restoration programmes of habitat enhancement and restoration of benthic and mobile populations for influencing the attitudes (and subsequent behaviours) of the communities where they are based. Our qualitative study investigated the impact of a coral reef restoration programmes on local environmental attitudes in a rural fishing community in north Bali, Indonesia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals and multi-stakeholder focus groups (n = 31) in Tianyar Village, where the NGO 'North Bali Reef Conservation' ('Yowana Bhakti Segara') was based. Our results highlight several factors that influenced environmental behaviours, including perceived value of coral reefs (e.g.,changes in fishing yield), drivers of support for coral reef restoration (e.g., local leaders' influence) and barriers to coral reef restoration support (e.g., lack of investment). Overall, our data indicate that the restoration programme has influenced positive environmental attitudes within the community through improvements in waste management, increased support for restoration work, and the establishment of new environmental regulations. Based on our results, we make five recommendations: (1) continuing environmental education within the community, (2) strengthening regulations and improving enforcement, (3) increasing financial and logistical support for waste management and ecotourism, (4) continuing the construction and deployment of artificial reefs, ensuring 'best practice' recommendations are followed, and (5) utilising the influence of local leaders to create positive environmental behaviours.

Part of this has been the way that the forest controls regional climate including precipitation important for the ecosystem as well as agro-forestry and farming. In addition, the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the rainforest significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion. The current fire activities and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest therefore have consequences for global sustainability. In the light of this, the current decisions made in Brazil regarding an increase in Amazon deforestation require policy changes if the global ecosystems and biodiversity are not to be set to collapse. There is only one way to move forward and that is to increase efforts in sustainable development of the region including limitation in deforestation and to continuously measure and monitor the development. The G7 countries have offered Brazil financial support for at least 20 million euros for fighting the forest fires but the president denies receiving such financial support and says that it is more relevant to raise new forests in Europe. In fact, this is exactly what is happening in Denmark and China in order to reduce climate change. Such activities should be global and include South America, Europe, Africa and Asia where deforestation is important issue. Forest restoration reduces climate change, desertification, and preserves both the regional tropical and global environment if the wood is not burned at a later stage but instead used in e.g. roads as filling material. Changes are therefore needed through improved international understanding and agreements to better avoid the global climate changes, from cutting down the precious rainforest before it is too late as rainforest cannot be re-planted.

TI  - COMPARISON BETWEEN AREAS IN RESTORATION AND REFERENCE AREA IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the restoration of degraded areas, in full protection conservation unit in the Atlantic Forest biome, in southern Brazil. The evaluated attributes were floristic composition and structure of vegetation and soil enzymatic activity (amidase, urease, phosphatase and arylsulfatase), involved in ecological processes, able to characterize different areas in restoration. The vegetation of the upper stratum was sampled in 18 plots of 10 x 20 m, in two recovered areas (A1 and A2), and in 12 plots in a forest area used as reference (AR). In these plots, the tree- shrub component was measured as for the diameter, height and canopy coverage of individuals and natural regeneration was studied in subplots, through the obtention of the root collar diameter and height. The enzyme activity was measured through the collection of 10 soil samples, in layers ranging from 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 20 cm in each area. The results showed that the areas in restoration presented lower diversity (H' = 2.31) when compared to the reference area (H' = 3.00), as well as lowest basal area, height and density. It is concluded that the enzyme activity a good indicator for the development in both areas restored, which compared to the reference area, will occur in the long term, indicating the need for management of A1 and A2, by eliminating grasses and exotic tree species, the determining factor for the success of the restoration.

TI  - Microbial community shifts indicate recovery of soil physical properties in a post-tin-mining area on Belitung Island, Indonesia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral mining often results in changes to the soil environment, reducing the sustainability of the surrounding environment. Restoring the physical and chemical properties of soil in post-tin-mining areas on the tropical island of Belitung, Indonesia, has been a laborious process after more than 10 decades of land reclamation. We aimed to determine which parameter of the soil properties was responsible for the slow recovery process and if there were other properties that indicated more rapid changes. We measured the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils of different periods in the post-tin-mining areas. We sampled soil from three areas: 0, 1, and 6 years after mining and an adjacent natural forest as a reference site. The soil water content, hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, particle distribution, mineral content, and soil microbial composition were measured in the field and analyzed in the laboratory. The soil showed a fine particle loss and despite the absence of clay, water-holding capacity was significantly increased in the 6-year-old soil. Organic carbon increased by 0.2% after 6 years of reclamation. Copper, iron, manganese, and zinc in the soils fluctuated less. Minimal amounts of Pb and Cd were found. Soil bacterial communities shift with land age. Actinobacteria were dominant a few years after mining, while Proteobacteria colonized the mined area after 6 years. This study examined the more profound changes in the soil properties of tropical post-tin-mined land. Soil and bacterial characteristics can be used as markers to monitor the progress of land rehabilitation.

TI  - Density and Spatial Distribution of Nests of Ectatomma ruidum and Pheidole fallax (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), as Response to the Recovery of Coal Mine Areas
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial pattern of two ant species of different feeding habits, Ectatomma ruidum and Pheidole fallax (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was assessed in rehabilitated areas of "Cerrejon" coal mine (Colombia). We tested whether there is a relationship between spatial distribution pattern, age rehabilitation and temporal changes. Three sites with different ages of rehabilitation (1, 9 and 20 years) and a secondary forest were sampled during dry and rainy seasons. Within four plots (6 x 40m) per site, we located, counted and estimated the minimum distance among nests. Our results indicated that the number of active nests varied according to sites and sampling season, E. ruidum had the highest density at both seasons, 166 nests ha(-1) (forest) and 1333 nests ha(-1) (9-y site). The nest density for P. fallax ranged between 125 and 625 nests ha(-1) in the forest and the 20-y site, respectively, and at 1-year site ants were absent. Our results indicated that the nest distribution strongly depended on the scale of observation. A uniform distribution pattern was also found, mainly at the local scale (plot level), while an aggregated and random distribution was found at the site level. We conclude that ant density responded mostly to seasonal changes (dry versus wet season).

TI  - Assessment and monitoring of deforestation and land-use changes (1976-2014) in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Andaman and Nicobar Islands are part of Indo-Burma and Sundaland global biodiversity hotspots. This study provides spatial information on forest types, deforestation and associated land-use changes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands during 1976 to 2014. Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques have been used to analyse forest cover changes, rate of deforestation and to map patterns of forest cover distribution in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Classified maps prepared for 1976, 1989, 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2014 indicate that the forest cover accounts for an area of 7086.1 (85.9%), 6969.2 (84.5%), 6941.1 (84.1%), 6934.6 (84.1%), 6617.8 (80.2%) and 6407.3 sq. km (77.7%) respectively. It was found that the area occupied by evergreen forests is very high, consisting of 3065.1 sq. km (32.2%) followed by semi-evergreen (1531.6 sq. km), moist deciduous (1133.4 sq. km) and mangrove forest (677.2 sq. km) in 2014. There is large-scale deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which has been estimated as 678.8 sq. km during the last four decades. The loss of forest cover is high in moist deciduous forests which has been estimated as 312.2 sq. km in Andaman Islands; whereas in Nicobar Islands, the highest loss was found in evergreen forests (244.6 sq. km). The rate of deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was high during 2000-2006 (0.78) indicating major influence of the tsunami of 26 December 2004. The annual rate of deforestation from 2006 to 2014 was 0.40. The geospatial analysis of areas of forest cover change provides baseline information for restoration and conservation planning.

TI  - Addressing bioassessment of tropical rivers using macrophytes: The case of Itanhaem Basin, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a pilot study on the potential of aquatic plants as indicators of ecological quality in tropical rivers to provide an index of biotic integrity for monitoring, conservation, and restoration purposes. We used floristic, environmental, and anthropogenic disturbance data from a 950 km(2) river basin in the southern littoral area of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (Itanhaem River Basin), and proposed a five-step methodological framework for the development of a macrophyte index in tropical river basins. Field surveys were carried out in 137 sites (Spring 2013-2014) of Itanhaem River for the index development and in 27 sites of Itapanhad River (Spring 2015) for its validation. A total of 44 aquatic plant species were recorded in the study area, and 11 metrics were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Principal Component Analysis distinguished two river types mostly related to geomorphological characteristics - the Upper river type in the mountainous region (average slope 23.7 degrees) and the Middle-low river type (average slope 9.2 degrees) in the floodplain. The Upper river catchment was characterized by extensive areas occupied by banana plantations, low water conductivity, sandy substrates, and homogeneous aquatic vegetation, whereas the Middle-low river catchment had more urban settlements and displayed high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water and sediments. The index (MIBI-ITA) is preliminary and was based on species richness and life forms (e.g. submerged hydrophytes, helophytes). MIBI-ITA could only be developed for the lowlands and displayed a high discriminatory ability for distinguishing disturbance and a good performance with external data. Bioassessment in tropical rivers require further investigation on biogeography and long-term responses of macrophyte populations to stressors, as well as knowledge-base on river typology and functional traits of macrophytes, other than morpho-anatomic traits and diversity measures.

TI  - Frugivory by phyllostomid bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) in a restored area in Southeast Brazil
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the potential contribution of frugivorous bats to the reestablishment of vegetational diversity in a restored area. We analysed the diets of the bat species and the differences between them in the consumption of fruits of autochtonous and allochthonous species. Planted (autochtonous) species were the basis of diets, especially Solanum mauritianum and Cecropia pachystachya, whereas for allochthonous species we found that Piperaceae to be of particular importance. Carollia perspicillata was the main seed disperser for allochthonous species, and potentially the most important bat in the promotion of vegetation diversity in the study area. Our results suggest that frugivorous bats are especially important in the reestablishment of vegetation in disturbed areas, and that restorarion efforts should focus on the planting of different zoochorous species that would guarantee a high year-round fruit production, thereby facilitating natural plant reestablishment by frugivorous bats in regenerating areas.

TI  - Short-term response of fish assemblages to instream habitat restoration in heavily impacted streams
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat homogenization has been a major impact in stream ecosystems, and it is considered one of the main drivers of biotic homogenization as well, leading to the loss of water quality and fish diversity. In this study, we added artificial woody structures and leaf packs in physically impacted streams to test if the additions can improve habitat complexity and change the taxonomic and functional structure of fish communities. The experiment was done in eight streams impacted by siltation, deforestation, and habitat homogenization, inserted in an agricultural landscape from the Upper Parana River Basin, and lasted 112 days. The provision of artificial microhabitats increased instream habitat diversity by creating patches of organic matter deposits, changing flow, and providing substrate for grass colonization of the instream habitat. The experimental manipulation also changed fish species abundance. Nine species contributed to these changes, five decreased and four increased in abundance, indicating species responded differently to the experimental manipulation. However, overall species richness, diversity, and community functional traits remained unaltered. These results indicate that short-term habitat restoration on a local scale may not be enough to promote changes in fish community attributes of streams that are heavily impacted.

TI  - Elevation-based post-stratification in Atlantic forest sampling
T2  - PHYTOCOENOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Question: Management and restoration of biodiversity hotspots worldwide might benefit from an intensification of sampling effort through the use of larger field plots than usually employed. However, besides being more expensive, small-range elevation variation and the related floristic composition gradient may compromise the desired internal floristic homogeneity in larger field plots. We present a method to remedy these problems, which consists in sampling the field plot and post-stratify the sample if a significant relationship between floristic composition and elevation is present. Location: A 6.5 ha Atlantic forest field plot with an elevational range of 40 m, located in Southeast Brazil (22 degrees 50'S, 46 degrees 55'W). Methods: We sampled the field plot with one hundred 10 m x 10 m sampling units and used Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling to extract significant floristic composition gradients (stems 5 cm DBH). The median score of the axis that presented a statistically significant correlation with elevation was used to stratify the sample into two subsamples. Floristic separation between subsamples was evaluated through Multi-Response Permutation Procedure and the Indicator Value Method. Results: We recorded a total of 1080 living individuals of 119 arboreal species. The NMDS ordination resulted in a final solution with three significant axes of which only one presented a statistically significant correlation with elevation. We found a significant floristic separation between subsamples obtained on the basis of that axis and each subsample presented its own indicator species. Conclusions: Each subsample represents a particular community type and should be considered as an individual plot in the data bank to be used in the investigation of floristic complementarity in the landscape the study area belongs to. The approach proposed here may aid conservation efforts in other biodiversity hotspots, besides the Atlantic forest biome, favoring the definition of conservation programs at the plant community level.

TI  - Restoration Ecology of Lowland Tropical Peatlands in Southeast Asia: Current Knowledge and Future Research Directions
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of restoration ecology are well established for northern peatlands, but at an early stage for tropical peatlands. Extensive peatland areas in Southeast Asia have been degraded through deforestation, drainage and fire, leading to on- and off-site environmental and socio-economic impacts of local to global significance. To address these problems, landscape-scale restoration measures are urgently required. This paper reviews and illustrates, using information from on- going trials in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the current state of knowledge pertaining to (i) land-cover dynamics of degraded peatlands, (ii) vegetation rehabilitation, (iii) restoration of hydrology, (iv) rehabilitation of carbon sequestration and storage, and (v) promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities. For a 4500 km(2) study site in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show a 78% reduction in forest cover between 1973 and 2003 and demonstrate that fire, exacerbated by drainage, is the principal driver of land-use change. Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk. We conclude that successful restoration of degraded peatlands must be grounded in scientific knowledge, relevant to socio-economic circumstances, and should not proceed without the consent and co-operation of local communities.

AB  - Puspanti A, Kusumandari A, Faida LRW, Sudaryatno. 2021. Impact of rehabilitation and status area change on land cover and carbon storage in Paliyan Wildlife Reserve, Gunung Kidul, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 3964-3971. This study analyzed the land cover change and carbon storage after the rehabilitation of Paliyan forest. This study mainly focused on the forest status during 1999-2019, especially after establishing a wildlife reserve forest and after rehabilitation activity. We used a combination of canopy density model, carbon conversion, and changes of management-related data to analyze land cover classes in two decades of 1999-2009 and 2009-2019 representing the change in status of the area, rehabilitation, and management dynamics through the time. The result shows that at baseline (1999), the status was still production plantation forest dominated by non-forest/open land with the most carbon storage in plantation forest of 5463.04 tons of carbon. In the first decade, important events occurred such as continuing illegal logging until 2001; change of area status to wildlife reserve forest; and initiation of rehabilitation in 2003. There was an increase in non-forest areas during the first decade, and carbon storage decreased mostly in plantation forests with only 867.71 tons of carbon remaining. In the second decade, rehabilitation has shown a positive impact in increasing forested areas, and altered non-forest to the forested area dominated by open forest/mixed agriculture area, followed by plantation forest, and secondary forest. In this decade, the legality of the area status and rehabilitation activity underwent to be more advance. The carbon storage also shows the positive result with the most increase of storage in plantation forest of 4072.932 tons carbon, or almost 4.7 times higher than that in 2009. Total carbon storage in 2019 was 13257.50 tons, or almost three times higher than that in 2009. The rehabilitation required a longer period to achieve a more dense forest condition as in 2019 the area was still dominated by open forest or agriculture. The smallholder farmers and high dependency of the surrounding community manage the land to feed their livestock, impede the rehabilitation and restoration process, and de-escalate the transition from non-forest to forest resulted in the more vegetated area. This result is important for stakeholders for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting further rehabilitation strategies.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion is a growing problem, and species of the genus Pinus are known to be a problem in the forests of southern Brazil, including in conservation units. Here, we studied the ecology of Pinus taeda L. invasion in Rio Canoas State Park (PAERC) in regards to forest inventory, soil seed bank analysis, and seed rain assessment, in three distinct successional stages inside the park referred to as "Pinus invasion", "Old Growth Vegetation", and "Initial Vegetation". The forest inventory of 33 (20 m x 20 m) plots found Pinus in two of the three evaluated environments. Seed rain was collected bimonthly using 33 (1 m x 1 m) seed traps for a period of 1 year. The major seed distribution periods were in April and June, confirming data found in the literature. The seed bank was analyzed in February (summer) and June (winter) of 2018. Samples were kept in a greenhouse for a period of 120 days each. Summer evaluation showed no emergence of Pinus taeda seedlings, but the winter evaluation (June) did show the emergence of seedlings. The results showed that the soil seed bank is not persistent. Accordingly, the Pinus invasion reported at PAERC requires a restoration program, as well as one that controls reinfestation.

TI  - Selecting Native Species for Soil and Water Bioengineering Techniques: Alternative to Restore Areas in Brumadinho, MG, Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil and water bioengineering (SWBE) is a feasible, economical and ecologically friendly alternative to restore the riparian forest areas affected by the Brumadinho mining tailings dam rupture. We evaluated the vegetative propagation capacity by cuttings and initial development of nine native riparian species of the Paraobepa River for use in SWBE techniques. From the results it is possible to separate the species into two distinct groups, namely those that can resprout and produce roots from their cuttings (group 1: Acnistus arborescens (L.) Schltdl., Croton urucurana Baill., Gymnanthes schottiana Mull.Arg., Indigofera suffruticosa Mill. and Sesbania virgata (Cav.) Poir.) and are suitable for use as live cuttings in SWBE techniques; and those which were only able to produce shoots (group 2: Casearia decandra Jacq., Chrysophyllum marginatum (Hook. & Arn.) Radlk., Inga vera Willd. and Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi) and should only be used in seedling form to increase the diversity of the interventions.

TI  - Assessment the macrobenthic diversity and community structure in the Musi Estuary, South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The macrobentic community in the Musi Estuary is very diverse. However, it has been showing a declining trend recently due to an increase in waste from human activities entering the waters. This study aimed to assess the macrobenthic diversity and community structure and correlated to the water quality parameters of the Musi Estuary, South Sumatra. The method used was a survey collecting water quality parameters at eight observation stations. The salinity is measured with a refractometer, temperature is measured with a digital thermometer, pH is measured with a pH meter. The dissolved oxygen (DO), brightness and current are measured with a DO meter, Seichii disk, and current meter, respectively. The Ekman grab was used to collect the samples, and then we used a diversity index, a similarity index, and principal components analysis (PCA) for analysis. The results show that the water quality is found in a good condition for macrobenthos growths. The salinity is ranging between 0 and 15 ppt, temperature is about 29-30.8 degree celsius, pH is about 7.6-8.1, the dissolved oxygen is found to be 3.2-12.5 mg/L, the brightness is about 4.71-31.67% and the current speed is about 0.02-0.08 m.s(-1). The analysis also indicates that the microbenthic compositions consist of 18 species, which is grouped into five classes, namely Gastropods 56%, Crustacea 22%, Bivalve 11%, Actinopterygii 6%, and Polychaeta 5%, with an abundance of 0,67 to 13,33 Ind. m-2. The diversity index is generally in low categories (H '< 1), and the dominance index is more than 0.5. Based on the PCA analysis, it was found that the water quality parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and temperature) show significant correlation with similarity index at all observation stations. The macrobenthic diversity and community structure in the Musi Estuary is found to be increasing offshore and decreasing towards the river.(c) 2021 Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Biomass allocation and growth indicators for quality evaluation of seedlings of native forest species
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Procedures and methodologies for evaluating the quality and uniformity of seedlings are essential for homogenizing lots in forest nurseries and successful planting for reforestation. A study was made in order to evaluate the correlations between the allocation of biomass and the Dickson Quality Index (IQD) for seedlings from six native tree species of the Atlantic Forest as well as to select quality indicators that most affect the IQD and which can be used in a practical and precise fashion for the evaluation of native forest seedlings. Seedlings from six tropical forest species were used: Calophyllum brasiliense, Eriotheca macrophylla, Inga laurina, Psidium cattleyanum, Roupala montana and Sloanea obtusifolia. The following characteristics were evaluated: dry leaf (MSF), dry stem (MSC) and dry root (MSR) mass, as well as the aerial part height (H) and the stem diameter (D). Based on these variables, the following calculations were made: ratios of root (RMR), stem (RMC) and leaf (RMF) mass, as well as the total dry mass (MST), that of the aerial part (MSPA), the ratio of the aerial part dry mass to the dry root mass (MSPA/MSR), and that of the aerial part height to the stem diameter (H/D), and the IQD. The results were analyzed via correlation analyses. Based on the conditions of this study it is possible to conclude that: (a) the differences between the average IQD values of the species studied were not explained by the allocation pattern of biomass characterizing each species; (b) the MSR, MST and the D are the best variables for predicting the IQD of the seedlings from the forest species analyzed in this study; and (c) because it is a non-destructive method, D can be considered the best practical indicator for estimating IQD values for Atlantic Forest seedling species lots.

TI  - Bacterial community characterization in the soils of native and restored rainforest fragments
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest ("Mata Atlantica'') has been largely studied due to its valuable and unique biodiversity. Unfortunately, this priceless ecosystem has been widely deforested and only 10 % of its original area is still untouched. Some projects have been successfully implemented to restore its fauna and flora but there is a lack of information on how the soil bacterial communities respond to this process. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the influence of soil attributes and seasonality on soil bacterial communities of rainforest fragments under restoration processes. Soil samples from a native site and two ongoing restoration fragments with different times of implementation (10 and 20 years) were collected and assayed by using culture-independent approaches. Our findings demonstrate that seasonality barely altered the bacterial distribution whereas soil chemical attributes and plant species were related to bacterial community structure during the restoration process. Moreover, the strict relationship observed for two bacterial groups, Solibacteriaceae and Verrucomicrobia, increasing from the more recently planted (10 years) to the native site, with the 20 year old restoration site in the middle, which may suggest their use as bioindicators of soil quality and recovery of forest fragments being restored.

TI  - Beyond Climatic Variation: Human Disturbances Alter the Effectiveness of a Protected Area to Reduce Fires in a Tropical Peatland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is considered a major threat to biodiversity in many habitats and the occurrence of fire has frequently been used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas. Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001-2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.

TI  - Seeds' Early Traits as Predictors of Performance in Direct Seeding Restoration
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct seeding is a promising and low-cost restoration technique. To avoid wasting seeds, the selection of species with high field performance in their establishment can increase efficiency. We aimed to identify groups of forest species with the ability for direct seeding in a seasonal forest, investigate taxonomic similarity effects on species behavior regarding seeds' and seedlings' early functional traits, and classify species based on their probability of success by direct seeding. A planting system of 38 seasonal forest species was implemented at a density of 250,000 seeds ha(-1). The emergence was monitored over 720 days, and all individuals were identified, tagged, counted, and measured for height (H) and diameter at collar height (DCH). We evaluated early traits of seed vigor (field seed emergence), seedling performance, probability of success, and species autoecology. Species' ability for direct seeding was more related to the level of species phylogeny than to their family. Pioneer and non-pioneer species demonstrated similar abilities for direct seeding associated with field emergence, seedling abundance, and persistence. Field seed emergence traits influenced species' ability for direct seeding more than seedling survival or growth. Species' ability for direct seeding was related to early seed vigor traits expressed by field seed emergence and was independent of their density.

TI  - Topsoil volume optimization in the restoration of post-mined areas
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transferring topsoil to severely degraded areas, such as mined areas, is an effective restoration technique. However, topsoil from pristine areas is a limited resource, making it important to seek techniques that optimize its use. Thus, this study assessed the effects of adding a small topsoil volume (10 L/m2 or 1 cm layer), a seed mix of 14 species, and litter (30 L/m2) alone and in different combinations in the restoration of a rupestrian grassland area degraded by bauxite mining. The substrate in the degraded area was turned prior to applying treatments. Vegetation cover, density of individuals, and species richness were measured 30 months after the experiment was set up. The isolated use of each material and the simultaneous addition of topsoil to the seed mix were not effective. The simultaneous use of topsoil, litter, and seed mix provided the best result, presenting the highest vegetation coverage (60%), density (67 ind/m2), and species richness (26 in 12 m2). Although, to a lesser extent, the combination of seed mix and litter also presented satisfactory results. The combination of the three materials promoted the revegetation of an area that had been without vegetation for around 50 years, presenting a density of individuals and species richness comparable to those obtained with the use of thick topsoil layers (15-30 cm). Furthermore, the topsoil volume used was optimized.

TI  - Is being green what matters? Functional diversity of cavity-nesting bees and wasps and their interaction networks with parasites in different reforestation types in Amazonia
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the processes that shape biotic interactions within biological communities helps us to develop strategies for the establishment of ecological communities and to rehabilitate the functionality of degraded environments.We evaluated the functional diversity of cavity-nesting bees and wasps and their interaction networks established with nest parasites in different types of reforestation in Southern Amazonia. To do so, we used bee and wasp trap-nests to sample six different types of environments: pasture, teak reforestation, fig reforestation, mixed reforestation, natural regeneration and primary forest.Although the bees' functional diversity indices evaluated did not vary between reforestation types and natural forests, the functional traits of these insects were quite different in reforestation with planting species, especially teak. For wasps, we observed lower functional diversity in pasture, fig plantation and mixed reforestation. Moreover, we observed that while teak reforestation presented the highest parasite richness, parasitism rate and diversity of interactions, natural regeneration shows higher interaction specialisation.Our results indicate that the simplification of the structure of reforested environments contributes to increase the divergence in the functional diversity of cavity-nesting bee and wasp community and the interactions they establish with their parasites in relation to natural environments. However, these differences can be reduced by structuring the environment. Thus, natural regeneration can be a favourable strategy if the degraded areas are not severely impacted and present proximity to the source of propagules.

TI  - Technosols in coal mining areas: Viability of combined use of agro-industry waste and synthetic gypsum in the restoration of areas degraded
T2  - CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the viability of the combined use of coal processing waste (CPW), rice processing waste (RPW), poultry agro-industry sludge (PAS), synthetic gypsum (SG), topsoil (TS), and B horizon soil (BH) to reclaim areas degraded by coal mining. A Classification, Potentiality, Quantity/viability, and Application (CPQvA) systematic was employed to assess the feasibility of using these waste and materials to construct technosols. An experiment consisting of five technosols (T-1-T-5) was replicated four times in a completely randomized block design. Technosols fertility was analyzed 12 months after the establishment of the experiment. The mean fertility parameters, presented as mean & PLUSMN; 1 SD, were subjected to one-way analysis of variance, and the differences were tested using Tukey's test (P < 0.05). The results confirmed that RPW was the main source of Mg (1584 mg kg-1), K (1955 mg kg -1), Mn (708 mg kg -1), and Fe (1511 mg kg -1); PAS was the main source of Organic Matter (OM) (465 g k-1), N (42 g k-1), Al (2880 mg kg -1), and Zn (394 mg kg -1); while SG was the main source of Ca (30,494 mg kg -1). The T-4 and T-5 technosols, composed of equal amounts of SG + RPW + PAS and TS + SG + RPW + PAS, respectively, presented the best fertility results, with the higher mean values of K (96.3 & PLUSMN; 19.6 mg dm-3), Ca (1044 & PLUSMN; 165 mmolc dm-3), OM (62 & PLUSMN; 14 g kg -1) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (1066 & PLUSMN; 168 mmolc dm-3) observed in T-4, and P (40.4 & PLUSMN; 12.6 mg dm-3) in T-5. Notably, T-4 did not include TS in its composition, which is important because it does not require commissioning of natural areas to reclaim degraded areas. Each hectare of 0.2 m of T-4 would cost USD 23,291.64, considering just the waste transporting costs. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the combined use of waste tested in this study to reclaim degraded areas by coal mining.

TI  - Impacts of landscape-scale forest loss and a dry event on the demographic structure of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis Mart. in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss is one of the most serious threats to biodiversity in the tropics and mainly occurs due to the conversion of native forests by the expansion of human activities. In addition, regional climate change is likely to adversely affect the remaining biota. These disturbances may have direct or indirect consequences on the demographic structure of plant species in human-modified landscapes. To test this hypothesis, and thus look for management practices aimed at enhancing the population viability, we used the palm species Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae) to assess the demographic structure of five ontogenetic stages prior (2014) and after (2017) a prolonged drought event (2015) that occurred in the northeastern Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We also investigated the influence of landscape forest cover on the ontogenetic demographic structure, given that forest remnants were embedded within landscapes ranging from 6 to 97% of forest amount. We revealed that forest cover was a key predictor explaining the abundance patterns of E. edulis, with all ontogenetic stages (except seedlings, immature, and adults) exhibiting lower abundance in forest remnants surrounded by lower amount of native forests. Conversely, the regional drought event unaffected the demographic structure of this palm species, which may suggest that populations of E. edulis were able to cope with an isolated, though severe, drought event. The impacts of forest loss on E. edulis demographic structure, particularly on juveniles, raises a concern about the future persistence of E. edulis populations, since the early stages represent the adult generation in the near future. Management measures, including species reintroduction, forest restoration, environmental education programmes and the enforcement of environmental laws must be encouraged to safeguard E. edulis populations in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Soil fauna at land revegetation in bauxite mining areas at Porto Trombetas, PA
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to observe the colonization process of edaphic fauna community after the revegetation of degraded areas by bauxite miningin Porto Trombetas, Para state, Brazil. The soil fauna samples were collected in the years of 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2008, in different reforestation stages, and planted on subsoil with and without the addition of topsoil. The samplings were collected in pitfall traps and analyzed in laboratory. The evaluation parameters used were abundance, richness, the indexes of Shannon diversity and Pielou equability and the colonization pattern of individuals from the soil fauna. The planting age and the topsoil addition were determining factors in the restoration of the edaphic community, which was more intense in older plantings. In areas that went through older reforestation procedures, vegetation development has led to greater colonization and better structuring of the edaphic fauna community, increasing their diversity and restoring ecological processes.

TI  - Restoration of tropical rain forest success improved by selecting species for specific microhabitats
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of the Southeast Asian tropical forests is a global priority but is limited by a lack of experience and knowledge regarding tree species performance in the various micro-habitat conditions that are prevalent after disturbance. Here we study the survival, growth, susceptibility to damage and capacity to resprout of 38 Sumatran lowland tropical tree species in a restoration planting trial in several typical post-disturbance mi-crohabitats. 3200 seedlings were planted in four two-hectare blocks in February 2013 at the Hutan Harapan Ecosystem Restoration concession in Sumatra, Indonesia, and subsequently censused every six-months for two years to assess performance and changes in microhabitat conditions. By the end of the experiment overall survival was only 41%, with damage incurred by 55% of the surviving plants. Habitat conditions (light/shade, presence/absence of bamboo and shrubs) and their interactions affected survival in complex ways. Bamboo negatively affected survival whereas shrubs had a positive effect, except where bamboo was also present. Height growth rate increased when sites were light-exposed. Individual species performances also differed across habitats. Defining a minimum threshold of 50% survival as a measure of success in different habitat types, only two species (A. pavonina and N. wallichiana) could be characterized as generalists. Eighteen other species were characterized as specialists with good performance in one-three habitat types. Our findings suggest that enhanced restoration success could be achieved through better species-site matching.

TI  - Introducing Acacia mangium trees in Eucalyptus grandis plantations: consequences for soil organic matter stocks and nitrogen mineralization
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Eucalyptus plantations cover 20 million hectares on highly weathered soils. Large amounts of nitrogen (N) exported during harvesting lead to concerns about their sustainability. Our goal was to assess the potential of introducing A. mangium trees in highly productive Eucalyptus plantations to enhance soil organic matter stocks and N availability.Methods A randomized block design was set up in a Brazilian Ferralsol soil to assess the effects of mono-specific Eucalyptus grandis (100E) and Acacia mangium (100A) stands and mixed plantations (50A:50E)on soil organic matter stocks and net N mineralization.Results A 6-year rotation of mono-specific A. mangium plantations led to carbon (C) and N stocks in the forest floor that were 44% lower and 86% higher than in pure E. grandis stands, respectively. Carbon and N stocks were not significantly different between the three treatments in the 0-15 cm soil layer. Field incubations conducted every 4 weeks for the two last years of the rotation estimated net soil N mineralization in 100A and 100E at 124 and 64 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Nitrogen inputs to soil with litterfall were of the same order as net N mineralization.Conclusions Acacia mangium trees largely increased the turnover rate of N in the topsoil. Introducing A. mangium trees might improve mineral N availability in soils where commercial Eucalyptus plantations have been managed for a long time.

TI  - Life cycle environmental impacts of a prospective palm-based biorefinery in Para State-Brazil
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of about 18 million hectares of grassland in Para State, Brazil, and the possibility of increasing the livestock density display a good perspective for the oil palm expansion in pasture land. A life cycle assessment is performed for a prospective palm-based biorefinery to view two regional and one global environmental impact and the consequences of the land-use change in terms of GHG emissions. Oil palm cultivation in an area of similar to 110,000 hectares of land can annually produce similar to 39,000 tons of bioethanol, similar to 340,000 tons of biodiesel, similar to 268 GW h net electricity and other co-products. The life cycle GHG emissions reduction for biodiesel and bioethanol as compared to fossil diesel and gasoline would be 76.9-79.3% and 83.7-88.6%. The advantage of grassland rehabilitation by oil palm plantation is the removal of similar to 188 t CO2/ha from the atmosphere during the plant lifetime. The entire inflows and outflows for the conversion processes are schemed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synchronous phenology of hawkmoths (Sphingidae) and Inga species (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae): implications for the restoration of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biotic and abiotic factors such as resource availability and rainfall may exert influence on the life cycle of several organisms. In this study, we investigated correlations between the phenology of hawkmoths, flowering phenology of Inga Mill. species (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae-Ingeae) and rainfall in one of the largest remnants of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (Coimbra forest with ca. 3500 ha). We carried out monthly hawkmoth inventories and phenological observations of the five most abundant Inga species in Coimbra forest from October 2005 to August 2007. Altogether 39 hawkmoth individuals were collected with light trap or butterfly net, which were ascribed to nine genera and 14 species. With the present study Pachygonidia caliginosa Boisduval (Bombycoidea-Sphingidae-Dilophonotina) is registered for the second time in Brazil, since the species had been previously collected only in the Amazon. The tribe Dilophonotina was the most represented with five species. Animals with short proboscises (14.7-35.0 mm) represented over 69.7% of the sample. Most individuals were collected during the months of low rainfall, the same period of the highest flower abundance of five Inga species. The flowering of Inga vera, I. striata and I. ingoides was positively correlated with hawkmoth abundance. The synchrony of the activity period of these animals in adult phase with certain nectar sources, and the relationship between morphological parameters of hawkmoths and Inga flowers suggest a narrow pollination mutualistic relationship at the study site. Considering the hotspot status of the Atlantic forest due to high fragmentation and habitat loss, as well as the previous local extinction of hawkmoth species in smaller fragments of the studied landscape, our results are relevant for restoration plans not only for the Brazilian Atlantic forest, but for neotropical forests in general, where Inga is native.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsOur main aims are to test how: (1) different nurse species modulate the early establishment of multiple beneficiary species in a degraded area; (2) the intensity and direction of species-specific interactions between nurse and beneficiary species change during beneficiary ontogeny.LocationA shrubby Caatinga forest at Petrolina, northeast Brazil, degraded by grazing and logging activities in recent decades.MethodsWe conducted a factorial multi-species experiment in which seeds and seedlings of five beneficiary species were sown in the presence and absence of three pioneer tree species. Beneficiary species performance was monitored for different ontogenetic stages.ResultsWe found evidence of species-specific facilitation in which the intensity and outcome of the interactions between nurse and beneficiary species varied depending on species identity. Additionally, for most combinations of nurse and beneficiary species, ontogenetic shifts from positive to neutral or negative interactions were observed with increasing beneficiary age.ConclusionsWe provide experimental evidence that nurse and beneficiary species identity simultaneously influence the balance between facilitation and competition. Our results suggest that ontogenetic shifts may be a widespread phenomenon in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss that a key mechanism explaining these findings is the match between what nurse species offer and what beneficiary species require in terms of resources and conditions. As a consequence, different nurse species tend to favour or inhibit unique sets of beneficiary species beneath their canopies. We argue that species-specific facilitation is an overlooked mechanism promoting -diversity during community succession.

TI  - Recovery of bird species in minimally restored Indonesian tin strip mines
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird species richness and individual abundances were recorded in old, unrestored tin strip mine plots, in mined plots restored 1, 2, and 3 years before the study, and in adjacent, unmined, natural secondary forest plots on the 11,340-km(2) Indonesian island of Bangka (2 degrees S, 106 degrees E). The objective was to assess the ecological recovery of unrestored and minimally restored mine plots compared with surrounding reference forest. Unrestored mines had not been mined or used for any other purpose for 14-30 years; plots in their first, second, and third year since restoration were old mines planted with Acacia mangium (Leguminosae) at a density of 400 trees/ha. Natural secondary forest plots 20 or more years since the last disturbance were immediately adjacent to both unrestored and restored plots. Bird surveys on 4-ha plots were performed during the 1995 breeding season. A comparison of data from unrestored plots of widely varying ages showed no significant differences among them for species richness, diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H'), or individual abundance, indicating that little natural bird community recovery had occurred over time in the plots. However, increases did occur in restored sites over only 3 years for both species richness (r(2) = 0.29, p = 0.04) and diversity (r(2) = 0.45, p = 0.009). All values for third-year restored plots, however, were still significantly lower than corresponding values for adjacent natural secondary forest plots. The quick return of bird activity on the plots after minimal efforts at restoration supports the idea that simple, inexpensive restoration can be effective for "jump starting" degraded systems at large scales. Such a restoration strategy might be of particular value for degraded land in developing nations, where scientific, professional, and financial resources might be in short supply. Using this strategy, a small number of restoration professionals could mobilize the labor of many local people in many areas, serving to both improve ecological systems and to educate and engage local populations in restoration and conservation projects.

TI  - FIRST RECORD OF Eucalyptus spp. BARK-STRIPPING BY BROWN-CAPUCHIN MONKEYS (Sapajus nigritus, PRIMATES: CEBIDAE)
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Conflicts involving wild animals and forest plantations are registered all over the world, including the bark-stripping of native and exotic tree species by primates. In Southern Brazil, the Brown-capuchin monkey (Sapajus nigritus) is well-known for damaging commercial plantations of Pinus spp. and Araucaria angustifolia. In this paper, however, we report, for the first time in the literature the bark-stripping of Eucalyptus spp. by these monkeys. Considering the growing areas of eucalypt plantations in Brazil and neighboring countries, the information presented here is of great importance to the economy of Forestry. It also enhances the need of scientific studies aimed to minimize the damage for the production without jeopardizing wildlife conservation, as those designed to monitor the availability of food resources (mainly fruits) in native forest remnants and to improve it through the restoration of degraded forests or even those that seek for natural deterrents.

TI  - Split distance: a key landscape metric shaping amphibian populations and communities in forest fragments
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - AimHabitat split isolates forest fragments where terrestrial adults of many amphibian species live from aquatic-breeding sites where their larvae develop, causing population declines and shifts in community structure. In contrast to most fragmentation theoretical frameworks which point to the relevance of fragment area and isolation, a recent theoretical model predicts that split distance, defined as the shortest distance between a forest fragment edge and the nearby stream, should affect negatively the abundance and occurrence probability of populations in forest fragments and, consequently, their total abundance and species richness. The model further predicts that the quality of the matrix between the two habitats, called split matrix, will modulate such responses. Here, we provide the first test of these theoretical predictions.LocationAtlantic Forest, Brazil.MethodsSplit distance was estimated for all fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly disturbed biodiversity hotspot. Then, we selected 23 forest fragments, within a 1166-km(2) landscape, in a design that insured orthogonality between split distance (0-2000m) and fragment size (1.7-30ha). Split matrix quality (SMQ) and proximity, a measure of the availability of forest around the focal fragment, were estimated and controlled for in the analyses. Using multiple regression analyses with control for spatial autocorrelation, and AIC multimodel inference, we evaluated the relative importance of split distance, SMQ, fragment size and proximity to determine amphibian community and population attributes.ResultsMost Atlantic Forest fragments were affected by habitat split. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, species richness, abundance and the occurrence probability of many species declined with split distance and increased with SMQ, even when controlling for fragment size and isolation.Main conclusionsSplit distance can be used as a surrogate for conservation value of forest fragments for aquatic-breeding amphibians in landscape planning and restoration enterprises.

AB  - PERTAMINA Hulu Energy-Offshore North West Java (PHE-ONWJ), conducted a mangrove restoration activities in Sedari Village, Kerawang District. The program was conducted in collaboration with local community, which is named Mangrove Care Parents (OTAP/Orang Tua Asuh Pohon). The program is to assess the survivor rate of the planted mangrove; to evaluate factors that cause which influence the growth of the mangrove planted; and to plan an appropriate future mangrove restoration. The program consists of six phases. The current program consist of four phases. The phase 1 was started in 2012 on sedari riverbank and it was unsuccessful. The results of monitoring showed that, of the 15.000 seedlings planted only 2141 plants survived (14,3 % in 2014). The high mortality of the planted plants was due to disposal of dregded material from river deepening project. This accident happened was due to lack of coordination with local governments. The phase 2 was started on November 2013 by planting 3.000 seedlings in Karang Sari Orchard. Lessons learned from the failure suggest that monitorning should be done more frequent, i.e. monthly, and if there are dead seedlings, replanting new seedling were applied (called "tambal sulam"). The phase 3 and 4 was started in March and June 2014 each by planting 10.000 seedlings on abandoned fishponds in Tirta Sari Orchard and Tanjung Sari Orchard. The phase 5 and 6 will be done by the end of this year, the preparation was done by defining of locations of lands and signing agreements with land owner. The evaluation done by analyzing the soil texture in order to know the suitability between soil texture and mangrove species. Phase 1 untill 4, the mangrove species were suitable with the soil texture. Planning for mangrove restoration programs on phase 5 and 6 were selecting appropriate mangrove species to be planted. The soil texture on phase 5 were Clay, the suitable mangrove species were Rhizophora mucronata and R. stylosa. Meanwhile on phase 6 the soil texture were Silty Clay, so the suitable mangrove species were Avicennia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, and R. stylosa. Beside the suitability between the soil texture and the mangrove species planted, the research recommend a survey of awareness level of stakeholders and the knowledge on the mangrove function and benefit.

TI  - Riparian fruit input partially affects the distribution of stream fishes
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated two inter-related questions: How is the fruit consumption rate affected by fish assembly and how does an increase in fruit production alter fish composition and richness? To answer these questions, we carried out two complementary experiments in a karst tropical stream, Brazil, South America. First, we measured the fish assemblage composition before, during and after the addition of fruit under fruit producing trees. Added fruit increased differentiation of fish between up-stream and down-stream sites over time. Fish composition under fruit-producing trees was distinct from adjacent sites. Second, we set Inga laurina (Fabaceae) fruits on the stream bottom and measured the consumption time. We also analyzed if the fishes that consumed the fruits differed among 41 sites. Fish assemblage structure partially explained the observed consumption rate for the fish assemblages. Our study provides new information on how fruit input and the location of fruiting trees can induce spatial segregation within freshwater fish communities. Our results can help improving management plans for conservation and restoration of headwater streams, including the locations of riparian fruit trees that provide resources and promote hotspots of ecological interactions for freshwater communities.

TI  - Priorities for cave fauna conservation in the Iuiu karst landscape, northeastern Brazil: a threatened spot of troglobitic species diversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The definition of priority for conservation becomes an emergency because habitat loss and degradation are among the main impacts on karst landscapes. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the priorities for cave conservation through the combination of indexes that use species richness, species distribution, and proportion of the deforested area (PDA). The caves presented 287 non-troglobitic species and 37 species (11.7 %) with troglomorphic traits that are distributed in 50 % of the caves. The caves also present a high phylogenetic and functional diversity of terrestrial, aquatic, and amphibious cave-restricted species, including many predators, scavengers, and one phytophagous species, most of them presenting remarkable specialized traits and restrict distribution in a few caves and in specific biotopes. The PDA were positively related to the distance from the limestone outcrop, because of the restrictive landforms for agropastoral activities. At least two caves present extremely high priority for conservation (Baixao and Baixa da Fortuna caves), while four caves present high priority, and almost all others require at least a conservation action. Suggestively, in this specific case, a coherent strategy was shown to maintain the preserved vegetation around the caves, improving the restoration of small fragments and minimizing alterations. Despite the results of the indices, the singularity of the area regarding the taxonomic and functional diversity of troglobites also reinforces the urgent need for conservation actions.

TI  - Influence of nutrient management on growth and nutrient use efficiency of two plant species for mineland revegetation
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rehabilitation of degraded areas by mining activities is necessary to achieve sustainable mining. For an effective revegetation, the understanding of plant growth and the nutrient requirements of native plant species, especially those with the potential to be used in the rehabilitation of mined areas such as waste piles or mine pits, is indispensable. In this study, we evaluated the growth performance, nutrient levels, and nutrient use efficiency of an endemic plant (Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea) and ruderal shrub (Solanum crinitum) that are both found in ferriferous savannas, locally called canga in Carajas Mineral Province, Brazil. An experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions using samples of three different soils (oxisol, canga soil, and iron mining waste) without and with nutrient application; additionally, an omission trial was carried out in canga soils. Fertilization increased the growth of both plant species in all substrates. Macronutrient omission reduced the growth of plants stronger than micronutrient omission, indicating that the lack of N, P, and K may especially impact the rehabilitation of areas. The growth of S. crinitum was higher than M. acutistipula var. ferrea, highlighting its preponderance in mineland rehabilitation, although concerns regarding its role as a ruderal species persist. Therefore, further research is necessary for a risk assessment of the propagation of S. crinitum within mineland restoration projects.

TI  - Restoration Strategies in an Area Invaded by Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pteridium aquilinum is an invasive species that stands out for its aggressiveness, invading pastures, agricultural areas and forests. In order to improve this situation, several techniques have been tested, although not common to tropical climate areas. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of eleven tree species according to their density, planting model, and way of bracken removal, in the restoration of an Atlantic Forest area invaded by the species after a fire. The experiment was installed in a randomized block design, in a 2 x 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (planting x density x bracken removal methods). Bracken cover and survival were evaluated nine months after planting. In conclusion, more densified plantations with fast-growing species, together with bracken removal by harrowing, were more effective in establishing the species in bracken-dominated areas.

TI  - Influence of soil texture on nutrients and potentially hazardous elements in Eremanthus erythropappus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that control uptake rates and allocation of chemical elements among plant organs is a fundamental prerequisite to improve phytostabilization techniques of hazardous elements in contaminated areas. The present study shows evidence that different substrate textures (coarse and fine laterite) do not significantly change the partitioning of root and shoot dry biomass and with few exceptions, do not significantly affect the final average concentration of elements in Eremanthus erythropappus, but change the root:shoot allocation of both essential nutrients and elements potentially toxic to biota. Growth on coarse laterite resulted in significant higher K (30%), Mg (34%), P (25%), S (32%), Cu (58%), and Na (43%) concentrations in roots and lower Cd concentration (29%). In shoots, coarse laterite led to reduction in K, Fe, Al, and Cr and increase in Na and Sr concentrations. Changes in element allocation could be, in part, a result of differences in the water availability of substrates. Matric potential in coarse laterite was significantly lower in at least 47% of the days analyzed throughout the year. Changes in element phytoextraction or phytostabilization potential could influence the efficiency of rehabilitation projects in areas degraded by mining activities.

TI  - Mapping the regeneration potential of native vegetation in cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is a hotspot of biodiversity conservation and an important global agricultural region. Cultivated pastures under different degradation levels are dominant in the landscape and are being targeted for sustainable agricultural intensification and restoration of native vegetation. In this study, we classified the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado according to their potential for natural regeneration, based on field surveys and environmental predictors. We surveyed the native vegetation cover in 186 plots distributed along 93 cultivated pastures. The environmental predictors considered in this study were the proportion of sand in the soil, cation exchange capacity, climate water deficit, pasture age, slope, and pasture vigor index. We then applied the Random Forest regression algorithm to predict and map the cultivated pastures according to their potential for natural regeneration in the 19 Cerrado ecoregions. The potential for natural regeneration was classified into low (< 30% of native plant cover), medium (30-50%), and high (> 50%). Our prediction explained 75% of the data variability. Most of the cultivated pastures presented medium potential for natural regeneration (57%), while 31% and 12% presented high and low potentials, respectively. Cultivated pastures in ecoregions with high mechanization, due to their high water availability and extensive flat terrains, presented low potential for natural regeneration. This first attempt to map the potential for natural regeneration in the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado can be used as a proxy for planning low-cost and predictable restoration or environmentally sustainable intensification in this major type of land use found in this biome.

TI  - Mimosa scabrella BENTH. (FABACEAE) ENHANCES THE RESTORATION IN COAL MINING AREAS IN THE ATLANTIC RAINFOREST
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Pilot Reclamation Project (PRP) was developed in 1982 by the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of Santa Catarina-Brazil, with the objective to evaluating the adaptation of woody species to a land degraded by coal mining. After a full topographic reconstitution of the landscape, addition of nutrient load and sowing of herbaceous species, the area was split into 12 plots in which seedlings of 12 tree species were planted: three native trees [Bastardiopsis densiflora (Hook. & Arn.) Hassl., Mimosa scabrella Benth., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake] and nine exotic species [Eucalyptus saligna Sm., E. viminalis Labill., E. citriodora Hook., Grevillea hilliana F.Muell., Hovenia dulcis Thunb, Melia azedarach L., Pinus elliottii Engelm., P. taeda L., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels]. After 22 years, from the beginning of the PRP, the exotic species presented higher percentage of survival than native species; the plots which received either B. densiflora and S. parahyba or were covered only with herbaceous vegetation associated with solely a few shrubs. Conversely, the plots which received seedlings of M. scabrella displayed clear evidence of restoration in progress. The study conducted in plots that have received M. scabrella indicate an improvement of nutrient load (N, K, organic matter) in the substrate, a diversified composition of tree coverage (very similar to the nearby remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest) and other life forms, with prominent establishment of native trees with predominance of zoophilous and zoochorous species. Some characteristics of M. scabrella that could explain its outstanding capacity to enhance the restoration of the Atlantic Rainforest are also discussed along this paper.

TI  - Tropical Peatland Burn Depth and Combustion Heterogeneity Assessed Using UAV Photogrammetry and Airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide the first assessment of tropical peatland depth of burn (DoB) using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, applied to imagery collected using a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system operated over a 5.2 ha tropical peatland in Jambi Province on Sumatra, Indonesia. Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (+/- 1 sigma) DoB of 0.23 +/- 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to similar to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 +/- 29 tC.ha(-1) for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDARalbeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires.

TI  - A comparison of satellite remote sensing data fusion methods to map peat swamp forest loss in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of huge areas of peat swamp forest in Southeast Asia and the resulting negative environmental effects, both local and global, have led to an increasing interest in peat restoration in the region. Satellite remote sensing offers the potential to provide up-to-date information on peat swamp forest loss across large areas, and support spatial explicit conservation and restoration planning. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data may be particularly valuable in this context, as most peat swamp forests are in areas with high cloud cover, which limits the use of optical data. Radar data can 'see through' cloud, but experience so far has shown that it doesn't discriminate well between certain types of land cover. Various approaches to fusion exist, but there is little information on how they compare. To assess this untapped potential, we compare three different classification methods with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map the remnant distribution of peat swamp forest in the area surrounding Sungai Buluh Protection Forest, Sumatra, Indonesia. Results show that data fusion increases overall accuracy in one of the three methods, compared to the use of optical data only. When data fusion was used with the pixel-based classification using the original pixel values, overall accuracy increased by a small, but statistically significant amount. Data fusion was not beneficial in the case of object-based classification or pixel-based classification using principal components. This indicates optical data are still the main source of information for land cover mapping in the region. Based on our findings, we provide methodological recommendations to help those involved in peatland restoration capitalize on the potential of big data.

TI  - The importance of conspecific facilitation during recruitment and regeneration: A case study in degraded mangroves
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Facilitation can affect positively the survival, growth and fitness of neighboring plants and is able to promote the establishment of plant species under harsh environmental conditions. This study is one of the few to focus on conspecific nurse plants enabling the establishment of tree followers and the generally unknown interplay between facilitation and competition during recruitment and establishment.Field studies were conducted in an hypersaline area in north Brazil where the hydrological regime was disturbed by road construction in 1974. Avicennia germinans shrubs were able to recolonize subareas.Three different stages of re-colonization were identified by satellite imagery based on the vegetation coverage and were defined as the early, middle, and late stages. Different plant parameters, including height and crown radius of individual trees, were measured, and all plants separating mangrove seedlings and larger plants were stem-mapped.The Hegyi index was adapted to measure local interaction intensity, considering both positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) interactions among neighboring plants. Spatial point pattern analyses were combined with the interaction index to obtain a better overview of the strength and importance of the plant interactions within the different recolonizing stages.The spatial patterns displayed aggregation for all plants in all developmental stages. This is supported by the interaction index calculated for seedlings. The index, however, provides an early signal for the switching of plant interactions from facilitation to competition as the developmental stage increased. This feature remains undetected in the spatial patterns because self-thinning processes are linked to individual growth processes and require more time to take place.This study broadens the ecological concept of nurse plants from hetero- to conspecific, including the importance and strength of plant interactions. The studied degraded areas are recolonizing naturally, and conclusions can be drawn for restoration projects, which usually do not take facilitation effects into account.

TI  - Impacts of "Reef Star" coral restoration on multiple metrics of habitat complexity
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs face threats from climate change and local pressures that lead to reductions in their physical structure, impacting biodiversity by limiting habitat availability. Despite many efforts to actively restore damaged reefs, few projects provide thorough evaluations of their success. This study measured the success of the "Reef Star" method at the Mars Coral Reef Restoration Project in Indonesia in reestablishing the physical structure of reef habitats that were destroyed by blast fishing. We used photogrammetry surveys to measure the physical habitat structure of 17 large sites (1000 m2 each), calculating three complementary measures of small- and large-scale habitat complexity across degraded, restored, and naturally healthy coral reefs. We demonstrate that the restoration efforts have successfully restored small-scale habitat complexity, as described by surface complexity metrics (3.22 +/- 0.27 on restored reefs; 2.85 +/- 0.26 on healthy reefs) and fractal dimension (2.27 +/- 0.02 on restored reefs; 2.24 +/- 0.02 on healthy reefs). This demonstrates the capacity for restored reefs to recover important ecosystem functions that are lost in degradation. However, while restoration has delivered some increases in large-scale habitat complexity compared to degraded reefs, restored reefs still exhibit lower values of maximum vertical relief than healthy reefs, due to a lack of large physical structures. This lack of available large-scale habitat might impact fish populations, meaning that restored reefs with limited large-scale complexity may only support a restricted range of ecosystem functions. Effective reef restoration strategies must use a mixture of different methods that target the recovery of structural complexity at multiple scales.

AB  - This study aims at making a comparative study of the biotechnical characteristics of Sebastiania schottiana (Mull. Arg.) Mull. Arg., Phyllanthus sellowianus (Klotzscg) Mull. Arg., Salix humboldtiana Willd., and Salix x rubens Shrank. These species have, in previous studies, shown promising potentialities for slope stabilization and restoration of riverbanks. The experiment was installed in the banks of a creek in 2008, in Sao Joao do Polesine, in Rio Grande do Sul state. The variables analyzed were: survival rate in the field (%), number, diameter, length, and the sum of primary shoots, length of the longest primary bud, number and length of the secondary shoots and the sum of the length of the secondary shoots. Among the analyzed species, Phyllanthus sellowianus showed the best results for the five characteristics evaluated, suggesting that it is the most suitable species for the stabilization and the recovery of riverbanks in this region, among the studied species.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community in soils under desertification and restoration in the Brazilian semiarid
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil desertification has a significant social, economic, and environmental impact worldwide. Mycorrhizal diversity remains poorly understood in semiarid regions impacted by desertification, especially in Brazilian drylands. More importantly, positive impacts of grazing exclusion on mycorrhizal communities are still incipient. Here, we hypothesized that overgrazing changes the structure of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) community compared to native areas and, grazing exclusion is effective to restore the AMF community. Thus, we analyzed the status of AMF community in soils under desertification (overgrazing) and restoration (twenty-years of grazing exclusion) in the Brazilian semiarid. AMF-spores were extracted via humid decantation methodology, morphologically classified, and alpha diversity metrics were calculated. Soil samples were chemically, and physically characterized and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to verify the impact of soil degradation and restoration on AMF-community. Briefly, native, and restored areas presented higher contents of organic matter, phosphorus, microbial carbon, and beta-glucosidase activity. However, degraded soil showed higher Al3+, Na-+,Na- and bulk soil density values. The abundance of AMF spores was higher in restored soil, followed by degraded and native vegetation, and Shannon's diversity index was significantly higher in restored soils, followed by native vegetation. AMF-spores were classified into four families (Gigasporaceae > Acaulosporaceae > Glomeraceae > Ambisporaceae). Ambisporaceae was closed correlated with degraded soil, mainly with Al3+, Na+, and bulk soil density properties. On the other hand, Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were positively correlated with native vegetation and restored soil, respectively, thereby improving Shannon index, richness, enzyme activity, and soil respiration. Thus, grazing exclusion, in long term, can be a good strategy to restore AMF-diversity in soils in the Brazilian semiarid.

TI  - Seed banks of upper-montane areas, under post-disturbance restoration process, in "Planalto Sul Catarinense" region
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to verify the floristic-structural composition of regenerative seedlings of seed banks from areas under anthropic post-disturbance restoration process, in "Planalto Sul Catarinense" region, upper-montane environments. In each of three sites (Area 1, 2 and 3) at Sao Joaquim National Park, protected for almost ten years, but with different land-use history, we allocated one 20 x 100 m transect, sub-divided in 20 plots, where a total of 60 samples of soil and litter were collected. While the Areas 1 (A1) and 2 (A2) were originally covered by natural forest, the Area 3 (A3) can be considered as cattle raising grassland. In a greenhouse, all the collected material was submitted to the same procedure, with daily sprinkler irrigation. After the seed germination in trays, we performed a monthly qualitative and quantitative evaluation of emergent seedlings that were identified and classified according to origin (native and exotic) and life form. In one year, 5,604 seedlings were counted, belonging to 62 taxa. There was predominance of herbs (74.2%) and native species (67.7%), being Cyperus odoratus L. and Juncus capillaceus Lam. the most abundant. When compared to the original grassland area, those originated from past deforestation showed a greater species and life form heterogeneity as well as greater seedling density emergence from the collected seed bank. We concluded that the studied seed banks have the potential to support a prompt seedling colonization after disturbances, ensuring the soil cover, and thus, the necessary initial support for the advance of successional dynamics.

TI  - Dark septate endophytes symbiosis in Falcataria moluccana and its potency for forest and landscape restoration
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Falcataria moluccana is a potential forest tree species with high economic value in indonesia, and it is widely planted in various forests and landscape restorations. The planting of F. moluccana has experienced a decline in productivity attributed to a reduction in site quality and heightened susceptibility to pest and disease infestations. Dark septate endophytes are a group of root endophytic fungi that have potential as biological control and promoter agents. The objective of this study is to evaluate the symbiotic capabilities of various isolates of dark septate endophytes, assess the impact of dark septate endophytes on the sprouting of F. moluccana seeds, and identify the secondary metabolites generated as a result of this symbiotic relationship. METHODS: The study encompassed the employment of three isolates of dark septate endophytes, specifically Rhizopycnis vagum, Curvularia sp., and Dendrothyrium sp. Those isolates were inoculated on the seeds of F. moluccana and observed the endophytism and metabolite compounds produced after 23 hours and 14 days of inoculation time. FINDINGS: Three new findings of this study were: 1) the dark septate endophytes isolates, i.e., Rhizopycnis vagum, Curvularia sp., and Dendrothyrium sp. could colonize F. moluccana seeds on the surface with a colonization rate of 96 percent, 100 percent, and 32.5 percent, and entered the seed tissue and the sprout roots with a colonization rate of 93.3 percent, 93.3 percent, and 70 percent. The dark septate endophytes colonization could be seen at the beginning of germination, inoculation of 0-23 hours, and after germination until observation at the age of 14 days; 2) The dark septate endophytes has the potential to improve seed germination and vigor of F. moluccana, by speeding up the germination process and increasing the vigor index, this condition is expected to produce seeds that can grow and survive environmental stress; 3) The dark septate endophytes has the potential to trigger an increase secondary metabolite compounds in F. moluccana seeds, which can be as antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidants such as the Hexamethyl Cyclotrisilaxane compound, 1-Isopropenyl-4-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene, and Acetamide, 2, 2,2-trifluoroN-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) as a form of plant protection when the F. moluccana seeds grew and developed to be a normal seedling. These conditions are believed to produce high-quality seedlings that can grow and adapt well to their new environment after being outplanted. CONCLUSION: Colonization of F. moluccana seeds by dark septate endophytes does not have a negative impact on seed viability. Therefore, inoculating seeds with dark septate endophytes can serve as an effective seed treatment method, resulting in the production of robust and healthy F. moluccana seedlings. This approach can contribute to enhancing the success of planting efforts aimed at restoring degraded forest and landscape areas.

TI  - Initial growth and ecophysiological aspects of forest legumes inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi in areas degraded by mining
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth in plant height, stem base diameter, survival rate, and ecophysiology of Acacia mangium and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia plants with and without inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Rhizophagus clarus) in areas degraded by mining in the municipality of Itaporanga D'Ajuda, SE, Brazil. The experiment was conducted with plants grown with spacing of 3 x 3 m in areas degraded by sand and gravel mining in Itaporanga D'Ajuda, using plants of the species Acacia mangium and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia. Four treatments were used: Acacia mangium without AMF; Mimosa caesalpiniifolia without AMF; Acacia mangium with AMF; Mimosa caesalpiniifolia with AMF. Plants from each treatment were evaluated for plant height, stem base diameter, survival rate and ecophysiological parameters at 12 months after planting. The forest legume Mimosa caesalpiniifolia inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi (Rhizophagus clarus) presented the best results in plant height, survival rate, and photosynthetic efficiency, at twelve months after planting. Plants in the treatment with Acacia mangium without inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi (Rhizophagus clarus) had the largest stem base diameters and second highest plant heights. However, the lowest survival rate of the plants may have caused overestimation of the results of stem base diameter and plant height.

TI  - Distinguishing forest types in restored tropical landscapes with UAV-borne LIDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors , include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize , distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration.

TI  - IMPACT OF SEEDLING REMOVAL ON NATURAL REGENERATION IN THE SOUTHERN ATLANTIC FOREST REMNANT
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of a forest seedling bank has been recommended as an alternative to increase species richness in forest nurseries, as well as to produce seedlings of species that are difficult to propagate, especially those that belong to the late secondary and climax successional groups, which are not as commercially available. However, little is known about the impact of this method on forest dynamics. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the resilience and dynamics of a seedling bank in a remnant of a subtropical seasonal forest belonging to the Atlantic Forest Biome when subjected to different intensities of seedling removal. The experiment was conducted in a random block design in a factorial scheme (5 x 4), with treatments composed of five intensities of removal of individuals from the seedling bank and the four seasons. The treatments were distributed into 18 blocks and the experimental units were composed of 1 m x 2.5 m plots. The resilience of the seedling community was assessed by examining effects of the five removal intensities. The dynamics between the evaluation periods within each treatment were verified by comparing the number of species and seedlings present before the treatments with those in the other evaluation periods. After one year, we found that tree-shrub vegetation had a partial capacity for restoration after withdrawal of individuals from the seedling bank. Our results show that the impact on the regeneration community can absorb the effects of up to 25% seedling removal. The technique of seedling transplantation may be recommended for species that have abundant regeneration, such as Actinostemon concolor, Eugenia rostrifolia, Trichilia claussenii and Nectandra megapotamica.

TI  - Vegetation and seed bank of an open-scrub bush restinga formation in the Southeastern coast of Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Restingas are coastal plain ecosystems located along Eastern Brazil. corresponding to about 5 000 km. The restinga vegetation is associated with the Atlantic rainforest biome and comprises four distinct main formation zones: coastal grasslands, shrublands, open-forests and marsh zones. Especially due to coastal urbanization, this is a threatened ecosystem that, through its different shrub formations, exhibits a unique mosaic as a result of the vegetation distribution in nuclei of different covering, physiognomy and floristic composition. Objective: We aimed to characterize the above and belowground composition of a conserved, non-flooded, open-scrub, nuclei (patches of bushes) formation of restinga in Linhares, ES, southeastern Brazil. Methods: The vegetation survey was conducted using the line intercept method. Diameter and height of the first six nuclei were measured in five transects separated by 50 m. totaling 30 nuclei up to 350 in away from the shore line. The phytosociology and Shannon Index of the aboveground vegetation community were calculated. In the same 30 nuclei, leaf litter and topsoil layer (15 x 15 x 10 cm) samples were collected to survey the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for germination and seedling identification. The Sorensen Similarity index (SSi) was used to compare the floristic composition between the leaf litter and topsoil layer seed banks. Nuclei volume and number of species were calculated as well. Results: In the aboveground vegetation, 54 plant species belonging to 32 families were identified, totaling 1 098 individuals. The nuclei showed a diversity (H') of 3.08 nats, and an average diameter of 11.5 m (s = 9.1), area of 526.4 m(2) (s = 1 081.7), and height of 2.9 m (s = 1.1). Davillailexuosa, followed by Smilax rufescens, presented the highest IVI (Importance Value Index). A total of 1 839 seedlings from 32 species and 19 families were identified in the seed bank. Enydra sessilis (Asteraceae) had the highest seed density (544), while the family with highest species richness was Cyperaccae. A low similarity between the vegetation surveyed and the seed bank composition was found (only 5 species in common, SSi = 0.10). Conclusions: The results indicate that a post-disturbance early community, established from the seed bank, would have a substantially different species composition, but with other potential species to restore vegetation over the long-term succession.

TI  - A global review of the development and application of soil erosion control techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Various soil erosion control techniques (SECTs) have been applied for decades. Yet, dynamic development of SECTs on a global scale has not been fully explored in the literature. We identified 779 publications to summarize spatial and temporal patterns of SECT development across the world. To achieve this goal, we asked (a) how many SECTs have been applied in the real world? (b) How do susceptible erosion areas use SECTs? And (c) what are the temporal patterns of SECT development? We found 183 sub-categories of SECTs, including 85 sub-categories of engineering techniques, 76 sub-categories of cropping techniques, and 22 sub-categories of biological techniques. In contrast, there is a great deal of interest in the evaluation of biological techniques and cropping techniques for soil erosion control. SECT research has evolved from an initial focus on a single SECT evaluation to a combination of SECTs evaluations (e.g. a combination of conservation tillage and mulch). Likewise, 64% of SECT cases were found in six countries with a different focal SECT among them: China and Spain targeted vegetation restoration, Brazil and the United States focused on conservation tillage, Ethiopia prioritized mixed SECTs, and India emphasized on check dam. Lastly, SECT application started from site erosion control (1930s-1980s), watershed management (1980s-2010s), to sustainable management (after 2010s). We identify the gaps between SECT application and research and a lack of an international platform for knowledge sharing, and propose that a combination of different SETCs in a balanced way is a reliable approach to obtaining the goal of sustainable soil management.

TI  - Effects of the planting of legume species and soil conditions on the recovery of a sand and pebble mining area
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive areas have been degraded worldwide through mineral extraction. Mining class II, especially sand and pebble mining (gravel extraction), has grown significantly in Brazilian Amazonia mainly in the State of Para. In this context, the development of suitable and efficient recovery techniques is necessary to ensure mined land restoration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different types of management and green manure methods to recover degraded soil after the mining of pebbles and sand. The experiment was implemented in the northern region of the municipality of Capitao Poco, State of Para. The procedures we used were: a randomized block design experiment, with a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement. Four legume species were tested: Cajanus cajan (L.), Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC, Crotolaria juncea (L.), and Mucuna pruriens (L.); in addition, three soil conditions were also tested: exposed soil, topsoil, and hydrogel. Results of the analyses showed how the root collar diameter, stem length, fertility, germination, green and dry biomass varied; the variable topsoil had better results when compared to the samples that used hydrogel and those established on exposed soil in practically all the mean comparisons for isolated factors. Besides this, C. ensiformis (L.) DC and M. pruriens (L.) showed a better development, especially when grown in soils with topsoil deposition as a reconformed substrate. From these studies we conclude that the use of this substrate is to be recommended. C. ensiformis (L.) DC and M. pruriens (L.) are also recommended for restoration.

TI  - Mechanism and control of Genipa americana seed germination
T2  - PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Genipa americana (Rubiaceae) is important for restoration of riparian forest in the Brazilian Cerrado. The objective was to characterize the mechanism and control of germination of G. americana to support uniform seedling production. Morphology and morphometrics of seeds, embryo and endosperm were assessed by light and scanning electron microscopy during germination. Imbibition and germination curves were generated and over the same time interval endosperm digestion and resistance were measured by puncture force analysis and activity assay of endo-beta-mannanase (EBM) in water and in abscisic acid (ABA). The gene encoding for EBM was partially cloned and its expression monitored by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction. Embryos displayed growth prior to radicle protrusion. A two-phase increase in EBM activity coincided with the two stages of weakening of the micropylar endosperm. The second stage also coincided with growth of the embryo prior to radicle protrusion. Enzyme activity was initiated in the micropylar endosperm but spread to the lateral endosperm. ABA completely inhibited germination by inhibiting embryo growth, the second stage of weakening and expression of the EBM gene, but EBM activity was not significantly inhibited. This suggests that a specific isoform of the enzyme is involved in endosperm weakening. EBM may cause a general softening of micropylar endosperm cell walls, allowing the embryo to puncture the endosperm as the driving force of the decrease in puncture force.

TI  - Seed rain generated by bats under Cerrado's pasture remnant trees in a Neotropical savanna
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we described the seed rain generated by bats under four Cerrado's tree species common within pastures, Buchenavia tomentosa, Couepia grandiflora, Licania humilis and Qualea grandiflora. We analyzed the similarity among the four tree species in terms of seed rain composition, and compared the number of seeds and seed species deposited under them. Besides that, we assessed the relationship between seed rain intensity and the density of each tree species. Then, we randomly selected 10 mature trees of each species to sample seed rain. We recorded a total of 4892 bat dispersed seeds from 11 species. Also, we observed that along the year seed deposition varied substantially under all trees. At least two seed sub-communities could be distinguished according to tree species used by bats as feeding roost. One related to Couepia grandiflora and Licania humilis, and the other to Buchenavia tomentosa and Qualea grandiflora trees. The variability of seed rain composition in any particular tree and the range of actual seed fall into a particular species indicate patchiness in seed rain, and the overall results appear to be consistent in terms of a substantial and diverse seed rain generated by bats in a highly anthropized landscape. This is the first study concerning seed dispersal by bats in modified Brazilian Cerrado, one of the most endangered biomes in the world. In this respect, by preserving a dense and diverse collection of remnant trees within today's pastures may, potentially, contribute to a faster Cerrado recovery in extensive areas that can be reclaimed for restoration in the future.

TI  - Are the assemblages of tree pollination modes being recovered by tropical forest restoration?
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsDo the assemblages of pollination modes in restored (tree plantings) and secondary (naturally regenerated) forests change in comparison to primary forests, and how do these assemblages relate to species turnover at regional scale?LocationSoutheast region of Brazil.MethodsWe classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode, based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness between forest types.ResultsFunctional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20%, >80%, respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee, wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination, whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and small insect pollination.ConclusionsOur results indicate a rather stable assemblage of pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes, and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in plant-pollinator interactions.

TI  - Fire in the Brazilian Amazon 3. Dynamics of biomass, C, and nutrient pools in regenerating forests
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerating forests have become a common land-cover type throughout the Brazilian Amazon. However, the potential for these systems to accumulate and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they are cut, burned, and converted back to croplands and pastures have not been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the states of Para and Rondonia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Residual pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha(-1)) represented 58% of TAGB, and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha(-1)) it represented 40% of TAGB. Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Aboveground pre-fire pools in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha(-1), 821 and 707 kg N ha(-1), 441 and 341 kg P ha(-1), and 46 and 27 kg Ca ha(-1), respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests. This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to 47 Mg ha(-1); N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha(-1); Ca losses ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha(-1); and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg ha(-1). Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass pools, site losses of N averaged 70% of total pre-fire pools. In contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and 20% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate that during 1990-1991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same period. Since average C accumulations (5.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in regenerating forests were 19% of the C lost when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha(-1)), our results suggest that when less than 19% of the total area accounted for by secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than 19% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net source of C to the atmosphere.

TI  - POTENTIAL OF NATURAL REGENERATION AS A METHOD OF RESTORATION OF DEGRADED LAND SURROUNDING WATER SPRINGS
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work evaluated the potential of natural regeneration in the restoration a disturbed water spring surrouding, after stopping the impacts, on forest and wasted grazing land. It was analyzed the structure of the stratum and natural regeneration under canopy and in open area surrounding a water spring under process of recovery, located in Nazareno, Minas Gerais. The tree stratum was assessed in 4 permanent plots (10 x 50 m), sampling, identifying and measuring height of trees with DBH >= 5 cm diameter. For assessing the natural regeneration, 16 plots (10 x 2 m) were set. Trees with height> 10 cm and DBH <5 cm were identified and measured. The samples were established at 7 and 51 months after the isolation of the area. Phytosociological parameters of the tree and regenerative strata were calculated for each species, classifying them by the type of dispersal and ecological group. Shannon diversity index and evenness were calculated for each community which were also compared by Sorensen index. The results showed that the areas are dissimilar; with most species found at the regeneration under canopy, showing a intake in the system. The communities had a high proportion of zoochoric species and pattern of higher light demanding climax species and a decrease in the proportion of pioneer species front one inventory to another, indicating progress in natural succession. The density of the individuals regenerating under canopy was much greater, probably due to the dominance of Brachiaria in the open area, showing that use of the regeneration as a unique method of recovery should not be applied.

TI  - An evaluation of direct seeding for reforestation of degraded lands in central Sao Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of a larger study evaluating several silvicultural techniques for restoring tropical moist forests on abandoned agricultural lands in southeastern Brazil, direct seeding with five early-successional Atlantic forest species was tested at three degraded sites, characterized by different soil types and land-use histories, within the Environmental Protection Area at Botucatu, SP. The species used in this study were Chorisia speciosa, Croton floribundus, Enterolobium contorstisiliquum, Mimosa scabrella, and Schizolobium parahyba. Scarified seeds of each of these species were sown in prepared seed spots in replicated, 0.25 ha mixed-species plots at an initial espacement of 1 m x 1 m at each site. Of the five species planted, only two, Enterolobium and Schizolobium, showed good seed germination, seedling survival, and early growth rates, averaging 4.1-4.6 cm stem diameter and 1.5-1.7 m height growth during the first 2 years after sowing. These two species constituted 88-100% of the total stand density, which ranged from 1050 to 1790 stems ha(-1) at 2 years. Despite the poor performance of the other species tested, we observed that the natural regeneration of native forest species originating from remnant forests in the general vicinity of our study sites was significantly greater within the direct-seeded plots than in unplanted control plots that were protected from fire and other disturbances.

TI  - Assessing Indicators and Limitations of Food Security Objectives in Coral Reef Restoration
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef restoration is often presented as a marine conservation solution that provides 'win-win' outcomes. However, most studies on reef restoration have focused on the biological success, while little is known about whether social objectives are ever achieved. This study investigates a reef restoration initiative in the Spermonde archipelago, Indonesia, where food security was initially presented as an intended social outcome. We utilised an ethnographic mixed-methods approach to investigate: 1) perceived sociocultural benefits of coral restoration to the local community; 2) impacts of reef restoration on local food security; and 3) local sociocultural barriers and limitations of reef restoration as a mechanism for improving food security. We found fish contributed to food security primarily as an income source to purchase food. Local people mainly valued nearby reefs for storm protection. Furthermore, most fishers are organised through patron-client systems that target pelagic species; therefore they currently have minimal dependency on adjacent reefs. However, fishing restrictions linked to the restoration programme still negatively impacted both pelagic fishers and a small population of reef-based fishers-indirectly by damaging reciprocal fishing relations with neighbouring islands and directly by limiting access to local reefs. Complex social and trade networks associated with patron-client networks present potential barriers for transitioning to reef-based fisheries and eradicating the use of destructive fishing gear, therefore limiting access to potential food security benefits generated from reef restoration. These findings show that the relationship between coral restoration and food security is tenuous and cannot be assumed. These findings also demonstrate that social dynamics surrounding community-based conservation initiatives are complex and context-dependent, and such details must be considered when designing marine habitat restoration initiatives.

TI  - Photosynthetic analyses of two native Atlantic Forest species in regenerative understory of eucalyptus plantation
T2  - Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigments of Xylopia sericea A. St.-Hil. and Siparuna guianensis Aubl. were evaluated during the rainy season and the dry season (2009-2010) in three understories with different ecological conditions (irradiance, water availability, and temperature) located in the Uni(a) over tilde o Biological Reserve (known as REBIO Uni(a) over tilde o), at Rio de Janeiro State, a natural forest understory, eucalyptus understory under regeneration, and understory of eucalyptus plantation with 18-year-old trees that were removed 1 year before. The lowest values of F-v/F-m e F-m/F-o were observed in the exposed understory for both seasons, with lower values in the dry season, suggesting that reduced water availability potentializes the photoinhibitory process. For both species of the exposed understory it is suggested the occurrence of photoprotection, given that an increased proportion of carotenoid pigments in relation to the chlorophylls were verified. Both species still exhibited dynamic photoinhibition after 1 year of exposure to full sunlight (exposed understory) in both seasons, but more markedly so in the dry season, though they belong to early stages of ecological succession. Based on the results, it is suggested that these species are indicated for planting in degraded areas and that the cutting of eucalyptus trees as management practice should be performed in a gradual manner, during the rainy season, in order to minimize stress on these species.

TI  - Photosynthetic plasticity of young plants of Carpotroche brasiliensis (Raddi) A. Gray, Achariaceae
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the shade tolerance of a tropical tree species based on the plasticity of 22 photosynthetic traits. Carpotroche brasiliensis leaves have characteristics of a shade-tolerant species, with low photosynthetic plasticity.The objective of this study was to evaluate the photosynthetic plasticity of young Carpotroche brasiliensis plants in response to different light environments. This tropical tree species has some shade-tolerant traits, such as large and fleshy fruits, seeds with a high water content, and the ability for natural regeneration in the forest understory. In this way, we tested the hypothesis that, at the leaf scale, young C. brasiliensis plants have photosynthetic characteristics of shade-tolerant species, with low photosynthetic plasticity when grown under different light environments. For this, seedlings were subjected to four light treatments (60, 35, 25, and 15% full sunlight, corresponding to about 20.9, 11.9, 9.1, and 5.4 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), respectively) for 5 months. We evaluated the photosynthetic plasticity at the leaf scale through morphological and anatomical variables, as well as variables associated with the diffusive, photochemical, and biochemistry phases of photosynthesis. All key photosynthetic variables measured exhibited values of typical shaded leaves. The highest simplified relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) for light treatments was found for light compensation point (0.32), performance index (0.30), photochemical reflectance index (0.30), mesophyll conductance (0.27), dark respiration rate (0.27), and leaf area (0.19). The lowest RDPI for light treatments was found for the leaf anatomical variables (< 0.1). From the 22 photosynthesis-related variables analyzed, we conclude that, on a leaf scale, young C. brasiliensis plants exhibit characteristics of a typical shade-tolerant species. Based on our results, we can recommend the plantation of C. brasiliensis seedlings in forest enrichment programs or agroforestry systems, in which other tree species are present providing light environments below 35% full sunlight or about 10 mol photons m(-2) day(-1).

TI  - Peat moisture dataset of Sumatra peatlands
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Peatland is a unique ecosystem that is key in regulating global carbon cycle, climate, hydrology, and biodiversity. Peat moisture content is a key variable in ecohydrological and biogeochemical cycles known to control peatland's greenhouse gas emissions and fire vulnerability. Peat moisture is also an indicator of the success of peat restoration projects. Here we present datasets of peat moisture dynamic and retention capacity of degraded tropical peatlands. The data were collected from automatic daily monitoring and field campaigns. The peat moisture content data consists of daily data from 21 stations across three peatland provinces in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, from 2018 to 2019. In addition, peat water retention data were collected from field campaigns in Riau province. This dataset represents human modified peatlands which can be used as a benchmark for hydrological and biogeochemical models.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ants as Bioindicators of Natural Succession in Savanna and Riparian Vegetation Impacted by Dredging in the Jequitinhonha River Basin, Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the response of ant species to landscape and geomorphologic parameters of a long-term (7-11 years) restoration project in the Jequitinhonha River (Northern State of Minas Gerais, Brazil) margins, previously dredged by a diamond mining company. Geomorphological changes from the dredging were severe and the area is unlikely to be adequately restored, mainly due to the negative effects of flooding. Our hypothesis is that ant species assemblages bioindicate successional stages and soil characteristics. We studied the association of effects from the river's flooding zone, the native vegetation, and sedimentary grain size with that of ant species diversity, abundance, and composition. An ant sampling program was conducted in April 2005, using three methods: baits, pitfall traps, and direct collection. Grain size was measured by sieving. In total, 10,784 ants were sampled, belonging to 7 subfamilies, 24 genera and 45 morphospecies. Ant species richness was greater in the undisturbed savanna area than in the restored habitats, and equivalently greater in the ecotone and intermediate zone habitats than on the river bank, the poorest habitat. Atta sexdens rubropilosa indicated a condition related to small forest remnants having well-structured soil. On the other hand, ants with a body length of under 0.5 cm (Dorymyrmex pyramicus and Pheidole fallax) predominated in sandy areas, where the majority of the granules were the finest. The lack of organic matter and soil structure for constructing suitable nests may prevent large ants from colonizing such areas, and thus inhibit the advance of natural succession.

TI  - Use of topsoil for restoration of a degraded pasture area
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of topsoil thickness, shading and origin when performing environmental restoration in a degraded pasture area. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with a factorial (3 x 2 x 2) + 2 layout. Treatments consisted of combinations of topsoil origins (forest at early or middle regeneration stages), topsoil thicknesses (10, 20, or 30-cm superficial soil layer), and presence or absence of 70% shading; with two additional control treatments. Surveys on topsoil physical-chemical attributes and flora and soil coverage were conducted. Good correlation was observed between bulk density and total porosity. Vegetation comprised a total of 2,932 individuals of herbaceous, shrub and subshrub plants; 33 species in 11 families and 1 morphospecies were identified. A floristic survey of the tree stratum revealed 235 individuals belonging to 21 species and 14 families, as well as 2 unidentified species. The best natural regeneration index is observed in the 20-cm topsoil layer, where shading exerts a positive influence on the humidity and natural regeneration of the seed bank. Topsoil from middle-stage forest is the most suitable for restoration of degraded pasture areas.

TI  - Assessing the reclamation of a contaminated site affected by the Fundao dam tailings trough phytoremediation and bioremediation.
T2  - International journal of phytoremediation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The rupture of the Fundao dam (Brazil) spread tailings contaminated with sodium and ether-amine into the Doce River Basin. Aiming at rehabilitating a contaminated riparian site, phytoremediation with native species of the Atlantic Forest was performed under four treatments: ES-1: physical remediation (sediment scraping) + chemical remediation (organic matter) + bioremediation (double inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis and the plant growth-promoting bacteria Bacillus subtilis); ES-2: chemical remediation+bioremediation; ES-3: physical remediation+chemical remediation; ES-4: chemical remediation. Ether-amine and sodium contents, plant growth and, soil quality parameters were compared among treatments and relative to preserved and degraded sites. Two years after planting, the outstanding plant growth was attributed to the phytoremediation of ether-amine and ammonium, followed by a significant increase in soil microbial biomass (Phospholipid fatty acids-PLFAs), particularly the Gram+ bacteria and total fungi but not AMF, whose response was independent of the inoculation. While sodium and ether-amine declined, soil K, P, NO3- contents, dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil aggregation increased, especially in ES-1. Thus, such remediation procedures are recommended for the restoration of riparian areas affected by the Fundao tailings, ultimately improving sediment fertility, aggregation and stabilization.
AB  - To the best of our knowledge, this is the only successful example of fragment of riparian Atlantic Forest successfully rehabilitated using native trees from the Atlantic Forest in the riparian zone affected by the contaminated Fundao dam tailings. For that, phytoremediation and bioremediation procedures were adopted to alleviate etheramine and sodium toxicity, resulting in the amelioration of soil fertility and particularly the stabilization of such highly disaggregated sediments, ultimately protecting the Doceriver basin against these contaminants.

TI  - Restoration success in former Amazonian mines is driven by soil amendment and forest proximity
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining contributes importantly to tropical deforestation and land degradation. To mitigate these effects, mining companies are increasingly obliged to restore abandoned mine lands, but factors driving restoration success are hardly evaluated. Here, we investigate the influence of ecological factors (restoration age, soil properties and surrounding forest area) and management factors (diversity and density of planted species, mine zone) on the recovery rate of forest structure and tree diversity on 40 post-mining restoration areas in Southern Amazonia, Brazil, using a 9-year annual monitoring dataset consisting of over 25 000 trees. We found that recovery of forest structure was closely associated with interactions between soil quality and the planted tree communities, and that tree diversity recovery was positively associated with the amount of surrounding forests. We also observed that forest structure and diversity recover more slowly in mine tailings compared to pit surroundings. Our study confirms the complexity of mine land restoration but also reveals that planting design and soil improvement can increase restoration success. For resource-efficient mine restoration, we recommend the focusing of efforts on tailings, which are hardest to restore, and reducing efforts in pit surroundings and areas close to surrounding forest because of their potential for restoration by natural regeneration.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Effects of riparian vegetation restoration and environmental context on ecosystem functioning in tropical streams of southeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical stream ecosystems are under increasing human pressure, making the development of effective restoration approaches and expanding knowledge in this field urgent. This study evaluated the impact of riparian vegetation restoration and environmental context on stream ecosystem functioning by measuring key ecosystem functions- gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and nutrient uptake of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus- across ten tropical streams in southeastern Brazil. The streams represented a gradient from clearcut areas (impacted reaches) to relatively pristine conditions (reference reaches), including intermediate stages of vegetation recovery (restored reaches). In the short-term (similar to 15-20 years after restoration), restoration led to reduced GPP akin to reference reaches. Yet, ER did not show the anticipated increase, suggesting a longer timeframe is necessary for restored streams to emulate the functional characteristics of reference reaches. Additionally, the restored reaches did not achieve the nutrient uptake efficiencies observed in both impacted and reference reaches, pointing to a partial recovery of ecosystem function. This study suggests that while riparian vegetation restoration contributes positively to certain aspects of stream function, environmental variables less related to this type of restoration, such as discharge and hydromorphology, significantly influence stream ecosystem functioning, highlighting the importance of considering environmental context in restoration efforts. A more holistic approach, possibly encompassing broader hydromorphological and habitat enhancements, is needed to fully restore ecological processes in these vital ecosystems. These insights are critical for informing future tropical stream restoration projects, advocating the use of ecosystem function metrics as comprehensive indicators of ecological recovery and restoration success.

TI  - Influence of environmental factors on the tropical peatlands diazotrophic communities from the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical peatlands of southern Brazil are essential for the maintenance of the Atlantic Rain Forest, one of the 25 hotspots of biodiversity in the world. Although diazotrophic micro-organisms are essential for the maintenance of this nitrogen limited ecosystem, so far studies have focused only on micro-organisms involved in the carbon cycle. In this work, peat samples were collected from three tropical peatland regions during dry and rainy seasons and their chemical and microbial characteristics were evaluated. Our results showed that the structure of the diazotrophic communities in the Brazilian tropical peatlands differs in the evaluated seasons. The abundance of the genus Bradyrhizobium showed to be affected by rainfall and peat pH. Despite the shifts of the nitrogen-fixing population in the tropical peatland caused by seasonality it showed to be constantly dominated by alpha-Proteobacteria followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, more than 50% of nifH gene sequences have not been classified, indicating the necessity for more studies in tropical peatland, since the reduction of N supply in the peatlands stimulates the recalcitrant organic matter decomposition performed by peatland micro-organisms, influencing the C stock.

AB  - Tumih / Parepat (Combretocarpus-rotundatus Mig. Deneer) of the family Anisophylleaceae and Meranti (Shorea Belangerang, ShoreaTeysmanniana Dyer ex. Brandis) of Dipterocarpaceae are groups of species of vegetation that is modeled for the designation of its spread. Pioneer species are predicted as an indicator of ecosystem restoration succession of wet tropical peatland characteristic (unique) and very susceptible (fragile) in an endemic Sundaland hotspot. Projected climate change and conservation planning a topic of heated discussion, the analysis of alternative approaches and the development of a combination of search algorithm projection models within the fabric of the diffusion of the species to attain this through a geospatial information system technology. Model approach used to work out problems in research on this vegetation species level based machine learning is a method (hybrid), which is a combination of wavelet and neural network. Often the approach to field data into general use in the management of natural resources and biodiversity assessment. Expression of the hybrid models provides encouraging results, to decide the classification of the species Tumih / Parepat and Meranti through mapping of vegetation species that are backed up by the pattern of the spectral curve of the field spectrometer.

TI  - Radioactivity of inert construction and demolition waste from Hong Kong and environmental assessment for marine trial reclamation in Guanghai Bay
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Inert construction and demolition waste from Hong Kong (HK public fills) has been used for marine trial reclamation in the Guanghai Bay (GHWT) of the Chinese Mainland. However, an environmental assessment of HK public fills is necessary due to higher radioactivity in HK soils than typical global levels. Here, radiation dose rate, gamma radionuclides and gross beta of HK public fills were analyzed. The origin information was explored using natural primordial radionuclides as fingerprints. Our data show that radiation dose rate of HK public fills before disposal was 0.14-0.54 (0.33 +/- 0.03) mu Sv/h (n = 16,722 data with 2787 ships) in 2014, which is less than the GHWT background. Monthly detection of U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, Th-228, K-40, and gross beta in HK public fills was conducted on three random ships. Their specific activities were <6.27-155.5, 58.7-98.7, <7.83-238.2,97.9-168.6, 87.1-136.0, 463.1-1,018, and 1047-1658 Bq/kg(DW), respectively. These results suggest that the radioactivity levels of HK public fills are essentially the same as the GHWT background. The study assessed potential risks using various indices icluding Ra-eq (Radium equivalent activity), H-ex (External radiation hazard index), H-in (Internal radiation hazard index), I-gamma (Gamma index), AUI (Activity utilization index), AUI (Activity utilization index), E (Annual effective dose), AGDE (Annual gonadal dose equivalent), RLI (Representative level index), D-in (Indoor air absorbed dose rate), D-out (Outdoor air absorbed dose rate), and ELCR (Excess lifetime cancer risk). The study suggests that HK public fills should be used for the trial reclamation rather than building-house materials. This provides valuable insights for the resource utilization and minimizing environmental pollution of HK public fills. The aim is to offer fundamental technical assistance for future waste resource utilization, ecological protection, and restoration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION MECHANISMS IN MIXED SUBTROPICAL WET FOREST REMNANT, RS, BRAZIL
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to characterize the mechanisms of natural regeneration in a Mixed Subtropical Wet Forest remnant. The study was conducted in the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil, using six conglomerates (I ha), with 16 plots (20 x 20 m) each, disregarding 10 m surround. The sampling of the seed rain (SR) was carried out in 96 circular collectors (1 m(2)), distributed in the center of each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was sampled randomly in a distance of 3 m of each SR collector and the seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2 x 2 m, located 4 m from SR collectors, counting the number of individuals (height >= 30 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1 cm) for each species. The regeneration mechanisms were evaluated through the floristic composition and horizontal structure. In SR, were sampled 81 species, 46 genera and 28 families, in SB, 103, 65 and 41, and in SeB, 88, 57 and 36, respectively The richness found and the presence of species with abundant fruiting and seed dispersal by animals, indicate the importance of seed rain as a strategic mechanism for the balance of flora and fauna in the ecosystem. The soil seed bank demonstrates potential for colonization and immediate restoration of vegetation after disturbances and the seedling bank is the main strategy for regeneration of many tree species that make up the current structure of the forest.

TI  - Carbon sequestration rate in sediment mangroves from natural and rehabilitated mangroves
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A major function of mangroves is carbon sequestration in sediment. This study aimed to determine differences in carbon content in sediments in various types of mangroves and environmental parameters. METHODS: This study was carried out in Pesawaran as a natural mangrove and in South Lampung as rehabilitated mangrove in Indonesia. Purposive sampling method was used by considering the types of mangroves at the locations. Sediment sampling was taken using a polyvinyl chloride pipe with a diameter of 47.46 milimeters and a height of 30 centimeters. The sediment parameters measured were bulk density, carbon stock, and sequestration. Environmental parameters measured included sediment texture, potential of hydrogen, temperature, salinity, and total dissolved solids. A statistical analysis was conducted using the principal component analysis to determine the relationship between the organic carbon stock and the environmental parameters. FINDINGS: The study results showed that natural mangroves (Pesawaran) had a higher organic carbon value at 2.2 +/- 0.32 percent than rehabilitated mangroves (South Lampung) at 0.9 +/- 0.25 percent. The principal component analysis results revealed that organic carbon, carbon dioxide equivalent, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration had positive correlation characteristics influenced by salinity, silt, and clay, while negative correlation characteristics were affected by temperature, total dissolved solids, and sand. The distribution of sediment texture tended to show more silt in rehabilitated mangroves, while natural mangroves tended to have the same composition between sand and silt. The potential of hydrogen conditions in natural and rehabilitated mangroves showed no significant differences in values. The salinity in Pesawaran, which was classified as a natural mangrove, was higher due to the influence of the tides and was directly facing the shoreline. Meanwhile, in South Lampung, which was categorized as a rehabilitated mangrove, the salinity was lower due to the long dry season and the canals being unable to support the water entering the mangroves. CONCLUSION: The organic carbon content at the research locations was influenced by the older age of the Rhizophora stylosa compared to that of the Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriop tagal types of mangroves. The carbon sequestration rate values showed 1.65-3.14 for natural mangroves and 0.29-1.25 for rehabilitated mangroves, thus establishing that the rate is higher (2-3 times) in natural mangroves than in rehabilitated mangroves.

TI  - Climate change mitigation on tropical peatlands: A triple burden for smallholder farmers in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.

TI  - Flower-Visiting Insects of Five Tree Species in a Restored Area of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reinstatement of biodiversity and ecological processes must be the major goal in restoration projects, which requires the establishment of biological interactions in addition to native plant population recovery. Therefore, we assessed the flower visitors of five tree species in a restored area of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. The specimens were collected using entomological net on flowers of Acacia polyphylla, Aegiphila sellowianna, Croton floribundus, Croton urucurana and Schinus terebinthifolius from October 2007 to September 2008. A total of 139 insect species belonging to five orders were collected. Hymenoptera was the most diverse order collected. From a total of 37 families, Vespidae (15 species), Cabronidae (12), Apidae (10), Halictidae (10), Syrphidae (12), Tachinidae (6) and Hesperidae (7) were the richest ones. Schinus terebinthifolius flowers presented the most abundant and diverse insect visitors (60), suggesting it is an important attractive species to the fauna in restoration programs. Our data suggest that mutualistic interactions between some of these plants and their flower-visiting insects may be in a reinstatement process, and will support the design and monitoring of future restoration efforts.

TI  - Tree regeneration and relationships with adult trees in a seasonal forest in the Uruguai river valley, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Tree regeneration and relationships with adult trees in a seasonal forest in the Uruguai river valley, Brazil). Studies related to variation in plant communities have been involved the analysis of regenerative potential of tree species, because saplings may enable forests to restore themselves after natural or human disturbances. The goal of this study was to analyze tree regeneration by identifying composition and abundance, the ecological groups of dispersion, vertical stratification and light requirements for germination and to look for changes in expected richness, diversity and relationships with structure of adult trees. A sapling survey was conducted in 20 sample units of 10 x 10 m where all individual living trees were sampled that had a height >= 0.30 m and diameter at soil height <= 4.7 cm. Adult trees with a diameter at breast height >= 4.7 cm were surveyed in 20 x 20 m sampling units, according to a previous study. We sampled 1,649 living trees (64 species), which generated a total density of 8,245 ind.ha(-1). The species with higher absolute density were Gymnanthes concolor Spreng., Trichilia elegans A.Juss. and Calyptranthes tricona D.Legrand. A principal coordinates analysis indicated sharp differences among sampled units and a Mantel test showed no dependence among composition and abundance matrices from adult and regenerative surveys (r = 0.19; p = 0.1). According to the ecological groups, we found that the regenerative component has kept the same proportions of adults, with a higher proportion of zoochorous, light demanding, canopy covering species. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found lower expected richness in the regenerative component (p < 0.001) with the same equability in the entire area.

TI  - Remotely sensed evidence of tropical peatland conversion to oil palm
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising global demands for food and biofuels are driving forest clearance in the tropics. Oil-palm expansion contributes to biodiversity declines and carbon emissions in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitudes of these impacts remain largely unquantified until now. We produce a 250-m spatial resolution map of closed canopy oil-palm plantations in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia (2 million ha), Borneo (2.4 million ha), and Sumatra (3.9 million ha). We demonstrate that 6% (or approximate to 880,000 ha) of tropical peatlands in the region had been converted to oil-palm plantations by the early 2000s. Conversion of peatswamp forests to oil palm led to biodiversity declines of 1% in Borneo (equivalent to four species of forest-welling birds), 3.4% in Sumatra (16 species), and 12.1% in Peninsular Malaysia (46 species). This land-use change also contributed to the loss of approximate to 140 million g of aboveground biomass carbon, and annual emissions of approximate to 4.6 million Mg of belowground carbon from peat oxidation. Additionally, the loss of peatswamp forests implies the loss of carbon sequestration service through peat accumulation, which amounts to approximate to 660,000 Mg of carbon annually. By 2010, 2.3 million ha of peatswamp forests were clear-felled, and currently occur as degraded lands. Reforestation of these clearings could enhance biodiversity by up to approximate to 20%, whereas oil-palm establishment would exacerbate species losses by up to approximate to 12%. To safeguard the region's biodiversity and carbon stocks, conservation and reforestation efforts should target Central Kalimantan, Riau, and West Kalimantan, which retain three-quarters (3.9 million ha) of the remaining peatswamp forests in Southeast Asia.

TI  - People, primates and predators in the Pontal: from endangered species conservation to forest and landscape restoration in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the 35-year progression of activities in the Pontal do Paranapanema region of SAo Paulo State, Brazil. These activities began as a research project on the conservation ecology of the highly endangered Black Lion Tamarin and broadened into a landscape-scale restoration and conservation project involving the active participation of hundreds of landless families that colonized the region. Rather than viewing these colonists as a threat, a non-governmental organization arose to address their needs, providing training and support livelihoods. Local communities were engaged in conservation and restoration activities focused on studying the movement patterns of endangered species, environmental education programmes, planting native trees along riparian corridors, establishing coffee agroforestry plantings and initiating community-managed nurseries for the production of local native seedlings and non-native fruit trees. Farmers gained knowledge, income and food security, and developed a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for protecting wildlife, conserving forest fragments and restoring forests. Land sharing and restoring forest functions within an agricultural landscape matrix created new opportunities for people and endangered wildlife. We explore how key factors and partnerships critically influenced the landscape trajectory and conclude with lessons learned that may be relevant to sustainable landscape initiatives in other contexts.

TI  - Strong climate mitigation potential of rewetting oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For decades, tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses, mainly oil palm plantations which now cover one-fourth of the degraded peatland area. Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 2 and CH4 4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 2 emissions, though CH4 4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 2 yr-- 1 . This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets.

T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the structure and composition of the tree and shrub community in a 77-ha fragment of Restinga forest in Caraguatatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. In this fragment, forty 20 x 20-m plots (1.6 ha) were systematically allocated and all trees with a stem diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 4.8 cm were sampled. Sixteen plots were randomly chosen to also sample individuals with a DBH of between 1 and 4.8 cm. All individuals were tagged, identified to species level, and their diameters and heights were measured. A total of 2587 individuals (1616 ind./ha) from 119 species and 42 families were found with a DBH >4.8 cm, and 2659 individuals (4154 ind./ha) from 125 species and 38 families were found with a DBH >1 cm. The richest families were Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, and Fabaceae, and the most abundant species were Diospyros brasiliensis (Ebenaceae), Anaxagorea dolichocarpa (Annonaceae), and Euterpe edulis (Arecaceae). The structure of the studied site was similar to that of other Restinga forest sites, but the forest composition was quite distinct. Implications for the conservation and restoration of Restinga forests in this region are discussed in light of the results obtained.

TI  - Fragmentation affects plant community composition over time
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat fragmentation can lead to major changes in community composition, but little is known about the dynamics of these changes, or how community trajectories are affected by the initial state of habitat maturity. We use four landscape-scale experiments from different biogeographicregions to understand how plant community composition responds to fragmentation over decades. Within each experiment, we consider first whether plant communities in the most-fragmented treatments diverge in composition from plant communities in the least-fragmented treatments. Second, because communities embedded in different fragments may become more similar to one another over time (biotic homogenization), we asked whether beta diversity - compositional variation across space - declines among fragments over time. Third, we assessed whether fragmentation alters the degree to which temporal change in fragmented landscapes is due to ordered species losses and gains (nestedness) versus species replacements (turnover). For each of these three questions, we contrasted patterns of compositional change in mature communities following fragmentation (disassembly; n = 2 experiments) with patterns in newly-developing plant communities in fragments cleared of vegetation (assembly; n = 2 experiments).In the two studies where communities were disassembling, community composition in the most-fragmented habitats diverged from that in least-fragmented habitats. Beta diversity within a fragmentation treatment did not change over time at any of the four sites. In all four experiments, temporal patterns of compositional change were due mostly to species turnover, although nestedness played a role in the least-fragmented sites in two of the studies. Overall, the impacts on community composition varied among landscape experiments, and divergence may have been affected by the maturity of the plant community. Future comparisons across ecosystems that account for species identities (vs simply richness) will be critical for predicting the effects of fragmentation, managing mature plant communities in remnants, and restoring plant communities where habitat has been lost.

TI  - SHRUBBY TREE COMPONENT OF RIPARIAN CORRIDORS IN RESTORATION AND NATURAL REMAINING AREAS OF MATRIX FORESTRY, RIO NEGRINHO, SC STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the floristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

TI  - Viability of using topsoil ferruginous yoke in the restoration of a waste dump
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the application of topsoil from a ferruginous rock field on natural regeneration and ground cover in a waste dump. To accomplish this aim, 26 plots of 1 m(2) and one control were installed systematically. Soil cover was estimated according to the percentage of live coverage, litter and bare soil observed in each plot. A total of 675 individuals, with 201 recorded in the first sampling and 474 in the second, were recorded. In total, 24 species and 11 families were identified, and a group of six was indeterminate, where four species were found in the first sampling and two species in the second sampling. Families with superior wealth in relation to the total were Asteraceae (26.92 %) and Melastomataceae (15.38 %); however, the families that had a higher number of individuals in the sample were Poaceae and Verbenaceae, with 33.33 % and 28.85 %, respectively. Those in the second sampling were Poaceae, Portulacaceae and Verbenaceae, with 93.03 %, 68.16 % and 35.82 %, respectively. Among the habits found, herbaceous was highlighted, with 65.63 % of the sampled individuals, followed by 6.22 % for shrubs, 5.48 % for subshrubs and 1.18 % for trees. The sterile substrate stack does not have to establish favorable conditions for vegetation because the control portion (not topsoil) filled in the two samples with 100 % bare soil.

TI  - Young restored forests increase seedling recruitment in abandoned pastures in the Southern Atlantic rainforest
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting seedlings is a common technique for abandoned pastures restoration in the tropics, supposedly by increasing the seedling recruitment and accelerating succession. In this study we evaluated the role of a young restored forest (one year old) in enhancing seedling establishment from two sources (seed rain and seed bank), in the Atlantic Rainforest region in Southern Brazil. We compared abandoned pasture, young restored forest and old-growth forest with respect to the seedlings recruited from different sources, by monitoring 40 permanent plots (0.5mx0.5m) over 20 months. From the three studied areas a total of 392 seedlings of 53 species were recruited. Species were mainly herbaceous (85%), pioneers (88%), zoochorous (51%) and small-seeded species (60%). Seedling recruitment from the seed bank (density and species richness) was higher and dominated by herbaceous species in the abandoned pasture and in the young restored forest; on the other hand, the recruitment of woody species from seed rain was more pronounced in the old-growth forest. The young restored forest increased the species richness of woody seedlings recruitment from the seed bank (two-fold) and from seed rain (three-fold) compared to the abandoned pasture. Also, the seedling density in young restored forest was still higher than abandoned pastures (seed bank: four times; seed rain: ten times). Our results show that even young restored areas enhance the establishment of woody species and should be considered an important step for pasture restoration. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1271-1282.

TI  - Reduction in Carbon Dioxide Production of Tropical Peatlands Under Nitrogen Fertilizer with Coal Fly Ash Application
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in peatlands, with the aim of increasing crop growth and production, is also reported to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The application of coal fly ash (CFA) to soil may change soil physico-chemical characteristics, thereby influence carbon mineralization, but its effect on CO2 production is not yet clear. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to quantify the CO2 production of tropical peatlands that received N fertilizer and CFA. In the laboratory experiment, CFA equivalent to the application of 150 Mg center dot ha-1 in the field was added to peatlands with and without N fertilizer. These mixtures were then incubated at 70% waterfilled pore space (WFPS) for 30 days at room temperature. Carbon mineralization was measured on a 5-day basis, while several chemical characteristics of treated peatlands, including pH, hot water-soluble C, exchangeable-Ca, -Mg, -Fe, and -Al were measured at the conclusion of the incubation period. This study identified that N fertilizer application increased the CO2 production of tropical peatlands from 29.25 g center dot kg-1 to 37.12 g center dot kg-1. Furthermore, the application of CFA on tropical peatlands reduced CO2 production of tropical peatlands with and without N fertilizer. Decreasing the amount of hot water-soluble carbon from peatlands may account for the reduced CO2 production of peatlands with CFA. The study also showed that exchangeable-Ca, -Mg, -Fe, and -Al increased in peatlands with CFA application, and these multivalent cations were also attributed to a reduction of CO2 production. In conclusion, the negative effects of N fertilizer application on peatlands in increasing CO2 emission may be reduced by the application of CFA.

TI  - Biophysical Benefits Simulation Modeling Framework for Investments in Nature-Based Solutions in Sao Paulo, Brazil Water Supply System
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the hydrological impacts of the nature-based solutions in the Cantareira Water Supply System, this study evaluates six different land cover and land use change scenarios. The first and second consider the restoration of native vegetation in riparian areas, the third prioritizes restoration sites using biophysical characteristics (optimized restoration scenario derived from Resource Investment Optimization System-RIOS), the fourth considers best management practices and the fifth and sixth are hypothetical extreme scenarios converting all pasture to forest and vice versa. Two hydrological models were developed to represent the distributions of water and yields in the study watershed: HEC-HMS and SWAT. Simulation results indicate that when nature-based solutions are implemented, surface runoff is reduced and ambient storage increases during the rainy season (December-March); while the overall flow increases during the dry season (June-September). The combination of specific hydrologic components of RIOS-customized intervention scenario simulation outputs-namely surface flows and groundwater contribution to stream flows-indicate on average 33% increase in the overall water yield, or 206 hm(3)/year, across the study watershed when comparing against the baseline conditions. In the same modeling scenario, the water storage in the sub-watersheds adjacent to the reservoirs showed an increase of 58% (or 341 hm(3)/year). The results indicate that adopting NbS in the source watershed can mitigate the impacts of extreme drought conditions and contribute toward building long-term water security.

TI  - Human disturbance drives loss of soil organic matter and changes its stability and sources in mangroves
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove soils with high organic carbon (Corg) content are likely to contain Corg that is vulnerable to remineralization during land use changes. Mangrove conversion to different land uses might deplete soil Corg stocks causing variable carbon dioxide emissions, but the extent of these emissions and the fraction of soil Corg (i.e., labile or stable/recalcitrant) that is mostly lost is poorly understood. Here, we study mangrove soil Corg degradability and its susceptibility to mineralization after mangrove disturbance. We measured changes in soil properties, organic matter (OM) stability and Corg pools and sources across a mangrove disturbance gradient (i.e., pristine forests, degraded mangroves receiving domestic sewage and shrimp farm effluents, and shrimp ponds). Results showed that the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds caused the most severe changes in soil properties, OM and Corg characteristics. Shrimp pond soils contained the lowest OM-Corg pools, consisted mostly of stable OM (i.e., recalcitrant and refractory; 36.0 +/- 5.7% of the total OM) and enriched delta 13Corg (-22.6 +/- 2.7%o). Conversely, control mangrove soils had the largest OM-Corg pools consisting of a large unstable OM fraction (i.e., labile; 46.4 +/- 4.2%) and lighter delta 13Corg (-26.8 +/- 0.4%o) being characteristic of Corg from a mangrove origin. Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds and its degradation by shrimp farm and domestic sewage effluents caused a loss of 97%, 61%, and 35% of soil Corg stocks in the upper meter, representing potential emissions of -1200, 800, and 400 Mg CO2 ha-1, respectively. These losses were explained by enhanced OM mineralization of unstable fractions driven by the loss of the physico-chemical protection provided by finegrained soils and vegetation cover. The differences in Corg stability among sites can be used to predict potential carbon dioxide produced during mineralization, hence aid at prioritizing areas for conservation, restoration or management.

TI  - Canga biodiversity, a matter of mining
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Brazilian name canga refers to the ecosystems associated with superficial iron crusts typical for the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (MG) and some parts of Amazon (Flona de Carajas). Iron stone is associated with mountain plateaux and so, in addition to high metal concentrations (particularly iron and manganese), canga ecosystems, as other rock outcrops, are characterized by isolation and environmental harshness. Canga inselbergs, all together, occupy no more than 200 km(2) of area spread over thousands of km2 of the Iron Quadrangle (MG) and the Flona de Carajas, resulting in considerable beta biodiversity. Moreover, the presence of different microhabitats within the iron crust is associated with high alpha biodiversity. Hundreds of angiosperm species have been reported so far across remote canga inselbergs and different micro-habitats. Among these are endemics such as the cactus Arthrocereus glazioyii and the medicinal plant Pilocarpus microphyllus. Canga is also home to iron and manganese metallophytes; species that evolved to tolerate high metal concentrations.These are particularly interesting to study metal homeostasis as both iron and manganese are essential plant micro-elements. Besides being models for metal metabolism, metallophytes can be used for bio-remediation of metal contaminated sites, and as such are considered among priority species for canga restoration. "Biodiversity mining" is not the only mining business attracted to canga. Open cast iron mining generates as much as 5-6% of Brazilian gross domestic product and dialog between mining companies, government, society, and ecologists, enforced by legal regulation, is ongoing to find compromise for canga protection, and where mining is unavoidable for ecosystem restoration. Environmental factors that shaped canga vegetation, canga biodiversity, physiological mechanisms to play a role, and ways to protect and restore canga will be reviewed.

TI  - Determining Optimal Location for Mangrove Planting Using Remote Sensing and Climate Model Projection in Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The decreasing area of mangroves is an ongoing problem since, between 1980 and 2005, one-third of the world's mangroves were lost. Rehabilitation and restoration strategies are required to address this situation. However, mangroves do not always respond well to these strategies and have high mortality due to several growth limiting parameters. This study developed a land suitability map for new mangrove plantations in different Southeast Asian countries for both current and future climates at a 250-m resolution. Hydrodynamic, geomorphological, climatic, and socio-economic parameters and three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for 2050 and 2070 with two global climate model datasets (the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Climate model version 5 [CNRM-CM5.1] and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate [MIROC5]) were used to predict suitable areas for mangrove planting. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the level of importance for each parameter. To test the accuracy of the results, the mangrove land suitability analysis were further compared using different weights in every parameter. The sensitivity test using the Wilcoxon test was also carried out to test which variables had changed with the first weight and the AHP weight. The land suitability products from this study were compared with those from previous studies. The differences in land suitability for each country in Southeast Asia in 2050 and 2070 to analyze the differences in each RCP scenario and their effects on the mangrove land suitability were also assessed. Currently, there is 398,000 ha of potentially suitable land for mangrove planting in Southeast Asia, and this study shows that it will increase between now and 2070. Indonesia account for 67.34% of the total land area in the "very suitable" and "suitable" class categories. The RCP 8.5 scenario in 2070, with both the MIROC5 and CNRM-CM5.1 models, resulted in the largest area of a "very suitable" class category for mangrove planting. This study provides information for the migration of mangrove forests to the land, alleviating many drawbacks, especially for ecosystems.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCENARIOS FOR LAND PLANNING OF PERMANENT PRESERVATION AREAS IN SOROCABA, SP
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the importance of the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA) for the forest remnants maintenance in the city of Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A forest remnants map was made using aerial photographs from 2006, and hydrographic and slope maps were used to PPA determination. Two scenarios were compared with landscape metrics: real (with current forest) and ideal ( current forest adding the PPA restoration). The results showed that 19% of the city territory were classified as PPA, and from this area, only 45% have forest cover. The preserved PPA represents 50% of all forest cover in the landscape. Restoring the PPA would increase from 16.68% to 28% of forest cover landscape and enable the emergence of fragments larger than 3,000 ha. In the real scenario, the bigger fragments have 300 ha. The presence of forest remnants is closely related to PPA areas: riverbanks, floodplains and hillside, where urban occupation was hampered and there is legal protection. The situation shows that the PPA play a fundamental role in forest patches conservation in a largely urbanized city, where natural areas support pressure. The evaluation of the scenarios showed that the incorporation of the legal provisions in planning and territorial ordering subsides the strategies for the maintenance of natural habitats and, consequently the reduction of the negative effects on biodiversity. However, the recent changes in Forest Code may represent a retrocession in the environmental scenario against to the increasing urbanization.

CP  - International Symposium and Workshop on Catalyzing Native Forest Regeneration on Degraded Tropical Lands
CL  - WASHINGTON, D.C.
AB  - Patterns of plant and animal diversity were studied in a 10-year-old native species reforestation area at a bauxite-mined site at Porto Trombetas in western Para State, Brazil. Understorey and overstorey floristic composition and structure, understorey light conditions, forest floor development and soil properties were evaluated in a total of 3878.5-m(2) plots located in the reforestation area at varying distances up to 640 m from the boundary with the surrounding primary forest. Wildlife surveys focusing primarily on birds and bats were also conducted to assess the role of seed-dispersing animals in regeneration of woody forest species within the plantations and colonization by primary forest species not included in the original reforestation. Regeneration density, species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) for woody perennial species, vines, herbs and grasses were strongly correlated with the diversity of planted tree species and structural development parameters, degree of forest floor development and soil pH. The better developed closed-canopy plots (>40% crown closure) were characterized by relatively well-developed litter (O1) and humus (O2) layers, more acidic soils being typical of the surrounding primary forests, and a more diverse herb, vine and woody perennial flora with a greater representation of primary forest species being characteristic of late secondary forests. In closed-canopy plots' a total of 125 tree, palm and shrub species were censused (versus 34 in the more open-canopy plots), of which 75 species are known to have been introduced by natural means from the surrounding primary forest (versus 11 species in the open-canopy plots). Among the plantation plots, there was significant colonization by primary forest woody species up to 640 m away from the primary forest edge, although both the abundance and the diversity of colonizing species declined with increasing distance into the plantations. Smaller-seeded primary forest woody species dispersed by mammals and birds represented a higher proportion of the colonizing species compared with the larger-seeded species. These data are consistent with the results of the wildlife surveys, which indicated that most animal seed dispersal is provided by bats, that the most common frugivorous bat and bird species in the plantations feed on small-seeded plant species and that birds and mammals that typically disperse larger-seeded tree species (such as toucans, trogons, tapirs, deer and primates) are still rare in the reforestation area. These results suggest that while the reforestation program has been successful in creating a favorable environment for regeneration of a native primary forest species, further management interventions, such as enrichment plantings, may be required to accelerate regeneration of large-seeded primary forest species.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for Biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With endangered status and more than 8,000 endemic species, the Atlantic Forest is one of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots. Less than 100,000 km(2) (about 7%) of the forest remains. In some areas of endemism, all that is left are immense archipelagos of tiny and widely separated forest fragments. In addition to habitat loss, other threats contributing to forest degradation include the harvesting of firewood, illegal logging, hunting, plant collecting, and invasion by alien species-all despite the legislation that exists for the forest's protection. More than 530 plants and animals occurring in the forest are now officially threatened some at the biome level. some throughout Brazil, and some globally. Many species have not been recorded in any protected areas, indicating the need to rationalize and expand the parks system. Although conservation initiatives have increased in number and scale during the last two decades, they are still insufficient to guarantee the conservation of Atlantic Forest biodiversity. To avoid further deforestation and massive species loss in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, the challenge is to integrate the diverse regulations, public policies, new opportunities, and incentive mechanisms for forest protection and restoration and the various independent projects and programs carried out by governments and nongovernmental organizations into a single and comprehensive strategy for establishing networks of sustainable landscapes throughout the region.

TI  - Physiological quality of seeds from different parent trees of Poincianella pyramidalis (Tul.) L. P. Queiroz
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Known locally as 'catingueira', Poincianella pyramidalis (Tul.) L. P. Queiroz is an arboreal species endemic to the Caatinga which is extensively exploited for its timber, forage and pharmacological potential. Given the relevance of this importance, the objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological quality of seeds among parent trees of P. pyramidalis using physiological tests, for the purposes of environmental restoration. The field study was carried out at the Fazenda Acude Farm, in the town of Soledad, Paraiba, Brazil, where 28 parent catingueira trees were selected. The analyses were done at the Laboratory for Seed Analysis, in the Centre for Agricultural Sciences of the Federal University of Paraiba. The following variables were evaluated: water content, thousand seed weight, number of seeds per kilogram, germination, vigor {first count and rate of germination index, seedling length and dry weight, emergence, emergence rate index and emergence first count, accelerated aging (traditional procedure and saturated NaCl solution)}. The experimental design was completely randomized, with the data undergoing variance analysis and the comparison of averages using the Scott-Knott test at 5% probability. Based on the results, the physiological quality of Poincianella pyramidalis seeds varies even when coming from trees in the same area, the accelerated aging test as used in the traditional method, for a period of 24 hours and at a temperature of 41 degrees C, is shown to be the most efficient means of testing vigour when evaluating the physiological potential of the seeds of P. Pyramidalis.

TI  - Metal toxicity assessment by sentinel species of mangroves: In situ case study integrating chemical and biomarkers analyses
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, there is a lack of knowledge about tropical ecotoxicology dealing with the potential impact of metal contamination in mangrove ecosystem. This habitat is considered a nursery for several animal species, among them the "uca"-crab (Ucides cordatus), known as a key species due to its biological and economical importance. This study evaluated the association involving metal contamination (Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Mn and Hg) in water, sediment, red-mangrove vegetation (Rhizophora mangle) and tissues of uga crab, together with its geno-cytotoxic responses, based on micronucleated hemocytes frequency and the retention time of neutral red in lysosomes. We assessed six mangrove areas with distinct pollution levels in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, where the water and sediment contamination by metals were associated with accumulation of these pollutants in biotic compartments (mangrove leaves and crab). In U. cordatus, metal accumulation was best explained by metal concentration found in leaves of R. mangle than in the water or sediment, indicating that feeding drives metal exposure in this organism. Mercury (Hg) concentration in sediment, copper (Cu) concentration in hepatopancreas of U. cordnnic and lead (Pb) in water and green leaves of R. mangle showed a significant correlation with genotoxic impact in U. cordatus. However, copper concentration (in green/senescent leaves and hepatopancreas) and lead (in sediment), were the major metals affecting lysosomal membrane integrity. Therefore, representatives of all compartments were associated with cyto and genotoxicity in this species, thus requiring a holistic approach to issues related to sublethal damage. Probability estimates of cytogenetic impacts related to metal concentration in abiotic compartments (significantly correlated with known biomarkers: Hg in sediment; and Pb in water and sediment) are also presented. Our results highlight the need for environmental restoration of mangroves areas contaminated with metals, responsible for cytogenetic injuries and revealing a pre-pathological condition in this sentinel species, in addition to ecological disturbances.

TI  - Accurate Measurement of Tropical Forest Canopy Heights and Aboveground Carbon Using Structure From Motion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly used to monitor forests. Three-dimensional models of tropical rainforest canopies can be constructed from overlapping photos using Structure from Motion (SfM), but it is often impossible to map the ground elevation directly from such data because canopy gaps are rare in rainforests. Without knowledge of the terrain elevation, it is, thus, difficult to accurately measure the canopy height or forest properties, including the recovery stage and aboveground carbon density. Working in an Indonesian ecosystem restoration landscape, we assessed how well SfM derived the estimates of the canopy height and aboveground carbon density compared with those from an airborne laser scanning (also known as LiDAR) benchmark. SfM systematically underestimated the canopy height with a mean bias of approximately 5 m. The linear models suggested that the bias increased quadratically with the top-of-canopy height for short, even-aged, stands but linearly for tall, structurally complex canopies (>10 m). The predictions based on the simple linear model were closely correlated to the field-measured heights when the approach was applied to an independent survey in a different location (R2 = 67% and RMSE = 1.85 m), but a negative bias of 0.89 m remained, suggesting the need to refine the model parameters with additional training data. Models that included the metrics of canopy complexity were less biased but with a reduced R2. The inclusion of ground control points (GCPs) was found to be important in accurately registering SfM measurements in space, which is essential if the survey requirement is to produce small-scale restoration interventions or to track changes through time. However, at the scale of several hectares, the top-of-canopy height and above-ground carbon density estimates from SfM and LiDAR were very similar even without GCPs. The ability to produce accurate top-of-canopy height and carbon stock measurements from SfM is game changing for forest managers and restoration practitioners, providing the means to make rapid, low-cost surveys over hundreds of hectares without the need for LiDAR.

TI  - Breakeven price of CO2 credits driving farmers to use the area to plant forest instead of grain
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation and reforestation were the challenges the farmer can seize to plant a culture that can capture more carbon than the amount emitted for cultivation. Assuming that the land was legally rented and owned, and part of an area that had not been obtained through recent deforestation, the main questions were: "why a farmer should have preferred to reserve the area to plant trees?"; and "How much did one ton of Carbon Dioxide [CO2] have to be rewarded to buy this opportunity?" This work had the target to estimate which was the minimum price for carbon credit so that the farmer will plant a forest instead of using the soil for grain cultivation. Based on the analysis that economic aspects and profit were the main drivers considered by the farmer to decide how to use the soil in case the area was not classified as Legal Reserve or Permanent Protection Area, seeking the usage which maximized the value per hectare. Considering a eucalyptus commercial forest planted under the premises of the current study, results showed that a price of around 24 BRL per ton of CO2 in 2021 is enough to turn it economically feasible. Business case had been estimated with and without profit coming from the commercial use of forest, and even assuming that no wood is cut and sold, the 2021 price of 40,48 BRL per ton of CO2 can ensure more profit than grain production over 14 years timeframe, allowing the farmer to make money beyond the usual commercial use of a forest.

TI  - THE POTENTIAL OF FOREST FRAGMENTS WITHIN EXOTIC FORESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF FORESTS WITH ARAUCARIA
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation and the use of landscape matrices by agricultural and forest cultures can change the species composition such that these will no longer reflect the structure of the native forests. Thus, fragments can lose their potential to provide propagules for restoration once they lose species, or when its structure is changed due to fragmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a network of remnant forest fragments formed +/- 60 years ago on a farm to act as a propagule source for a natural regeneration process. The study area belongs to the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (FOM) formation and is used in the production of exotic forest species. The 798 ha area is located in the Ponte Alta (SC) municipality. Data from phytosociological surveys of this formation were used for comparison, using curves based on the individual rarefaction, distribution of the six most abundant species, proportion of species and zoochoric individual, and similarity analysis in between different areas. The forest fragment showed compatible species richness and at certain times higher than can be found in other FOM situations. Mimosa scabrella was the most abundant species differing from other surveys. The amount of species with zoochoric dispersion mechanisms was similar to what was expected of FOM formations, however, the quantity of zoochoric individuals was below expected. The results indicate that the fragments show potential to act as propagule sources in the restoration process within the farm areas. Nonetheless, the capacity can be rather limited once the fragments show some different characteristics of other Araucaria's forests.

TI  - Size-dependent response of tropical wetland fish communities to changes in vegetation cover and habitat connectivity
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of native vegetation by exotic grasses for livestock production is driving landscape homogenization, habitat fragmentation and reducing connectivity between habitat patches in floodplains ecosystems.In this context we examined how changes in native and exotic vegetation cover, connectivity and water depth affect the attributes of the small [standard length (SL) < 80 mm as adults] and large-sized fish assemblages (SL a parts per thousand yen 80 mm as adults).We assessed the effects of water depth, exotic and native vegetation cover and habitat connectivity on the abundance, species richness, body size and biomass of fish assemblages in a 25 km(2) area of the seasonal habitats of the Pantanal wetland over 5 years.We showed that fish assemblage response to meso-scale variation in water depth, vegetation cover and habitat connectivity in seasonal habitats is size-dependent. The gradient from exotic to natural vegetation cover did not affect the assemblages of small-sized fish, which were mostly regulated by water depth, habitat connectivity and the gradient from grassland to forest. However, besides being affected by water depth and habitat connectivity, large-sized fish were also affected by the gradient from exotic to natural vegetation cover.Our results indicate that transformations in the landscape and changes in the dynamics of inundation may have negative consequences for the long-term persistence of fish assemblages in the Pantanal wetlands.

TI  - Multiple drivers influence tree species diversity and above-ground carbon stock in second-growth Atlantic forests: Implications for the passive restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally, and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number, and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found, only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock. However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.

TI  - Comparing species and measures of landscape structure as indicators of conservation importance
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - P>1. The use of indicators to identify areas of conservation importance has been challenged on several grounds, but nonetheless retains appeal as no more parsimonious approach exists. Among the many variants, two indicator strategies stand out: the use of indicator species and the use of metrics of landscape structure. While the first has been thoroughly studied, the same cannot be said about the latter. We aimed to contrast the relative efficacy of species-based and landscape-based indicators by: (i) comparing their ability to reflect changes in community integrity at regional and landscape spatial scales, (ii) assessing their sensitivity to changes in data resolution, and (iii) quantifying the degree to which indicators that are generated in one landscape or at one spatial scale can be transferred to additional landscapes or scales.2. We used data from more than 7000 bird captures in 65 sites from six 10 000-ha landscapes with different proportions of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Indicator species and landscape-based indicators were tested in terms of how effective they were in reflecting changes in community integrity, defined as deviations in bird community composition from control areas.3. At the regional scale, indicator species provided more robust depictions of community integrity than landscape-based indicators. At the landscape scale, however, landscape-based indicators performed more effectively, more consistently and were also more transferable among landscapes. The effectiveness of high resolution landscape-based indicators was reduced by just 12% when these were used to explain patterns of community integrity in independent data sets. By contrast, the effectiveness of species-based indicators was reduced by 33%.4. Synthesis and applications. The use of indicator species proved to be effective; however their results were variable and sensitive to changes in scale and resolution, and their application requires extensive and time-consuming field work. Landscape-based indicators were not only effective but were also much less context-dependent. The use of landscape-based indicators may allow the rapid identification of priority areas for conservation and restoration, and indicate which restoration strategies should be pursued, using remotely sensed imagery. We suggest that landscape-based indicators might often be a better, simpler, and cheaper strategy for informing decisions in conservation.

TI  - Influence of environmental variation on Atlantic Forest tree-shrub-layer phytogeography in southeast Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Influence of environmental variation on Atlantic Forest tree-shrub-layer phytogeography in southeast Brazil). This work assessed data from 32 forest sites in Rio de Janeiro and Rio Paulo, Brazil, using multivariate analysis to answer the question: Are there floristic patterns of the Atlantic Forest tree-shrub layer related to the Serra do Mar and the width of coastal plains in the states of Rio de Janeiro and sao Paulo? Three multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the tree-shrub flora and environmental variation in these 32 study areas. Our analyses demonstrated the influence of geo-climatic variation on floristic differentiation of tree and shrub species in Atlantic Forest regions generating groups of areas based on similar biotic and abiotic characteristics. These groups support the existence of floristic patterns within the states of Silo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and reflect tree-shrub species substitution between the study areas as a consequence of annual rainfall, altitude, and mean animal temperature variation linked to a change in the position of the Serra do Mar and an increase in coastal plain width. Preferential species were cited for each group and should be considered in restoration and conservation programs for the phytoecological regions represented by the groups.

TI  - The large Amazonian peatland carbon sink in the subsiding Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin, Peru
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon (C) dynamics of tropical peatlands can be of global importance, because, particularly in Southeast Asia, they are the source of considerable amounts of C released to the atmosphere as a result of land-use change and fire. In contrast, the existence of tropical peatlands in Amazonia has been documented only recently. According to a recent study, the 120 000 km(2) subsiding Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin in Peruvian Amazonia harbours previously unstudied and up to 7.5 m thick peat deposits. We studied the role of these peat deposits as a C reserve and sink by measuring peat depth, radiocarbon age and peat and C accumulation rates at 513 sites. The basal ages varied from 1975 to 8870 cal yr bp, peat accumulation rates from 0.46 to 9.31 mm yr(-1) and C accumulation rates from 28 to 108 g m(-2) yr(-1). The total peatland area and current peat C stock within the area of two studied satellite images were 21-929 km(2) and 3.116 Gt (with a range of 0.837-9.461 Gt). The C stock is 32% (with a range of 8.7-98%) of the best estimate of the South American tropical peatland C stock and 3.5% (with a range of 0.9-10.7%) of the best estimate of the global tropical peatland C stock. The whole Pastaza-Maranon basin probably supports about twice this peatland area and peat C stock. In addition to their contemporary geographical extent, these peatlands probably also have a large historical (vertical) extension because of their location in a foreland basin characterized by extensive river sedimentation, peat burial and subsidence for most of the Quaternary period. Burial of peat layers in deposits of up to 1 km thick Quaternary river sediments removes C from the short-term C cycle between the biosphere and atmosphere, generating a long-term C sink.

TI  - Mining tailings severely impact plant communities in a rainforest watershed
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of a mining tailings dam in 2015 drastically affected a large area of an already threatened Atlantic Forest along the Rio Doce in Brazil. We evaluated the interactions between edaphic and floristic factors in impacted and reference sites to understand how the impact of the tailings affected the riparian plant communities along the river. The species richness of the adult and sapling strata was, respectively, 46.4 % and 61.5 % lower in the impacted sites relative to the reference sites. A similar pattern was observed for both species and phylogenetic diversity. We also recorded large changes in species composition in the adult and sapling strata in impacted sites relative to the reference sites along the river. These negative changes in the plant community were correlated with drastic increases in soil iron and phosphorus concentration, and fine sand proportion, and decreases in the proportion of carbon and coarse sand in the sites impacted by the mining tailings. We observed a close relationship between plant composition in both the adult and sapling strata with edaphic factors. The alterations in species composition triggered by the deposition of mining tailings may induce significant shifts in ecosystems, potentially prompting numerous tipping points throughout the river basin, as indicated by the different sapling species, some of which are invasive species of highly difficult eradication. These altered forests might suffer from impoverishment, dominated by a limited species set, some of which could expand its distribution upon neighboring, already threatened, regions. Such expansion could exacerbate the degradation of the Rio Doce watershed to a point of no return to the previous condition.

TI  - Functional trait profiles and diversity of trees regenerating in disturbed tropical forests and agroforests in Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A main question in restoration of degraded forests and forest landscapes recovering from logging and fire is what to expect from natural regeneration through surviving propagules in the soil or seed sources and associated dispersal agents from the surrounding landscape mosaic, as alternative to tree planting. Tree diversity in sec-ondary forests may be high, but based on newcomer species of low wood density and long-distance, abiotic dispersal modes. We compiled and analyzed three pairs of case studies (totaling 815 plots and 11.8 ha) of sec-ondary forests recovering from logging, fire and conversion to agroforest in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) on mineral soils. Data on tree species diversity, wood density frequency distribution (indicative of successional status) and dispersal modes were compared with those of less disturbed comparator forests in the same land-scapes. Relatively undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan had close to 200 species of trees (>10 cm diameter) at a 1-ha sample scale (and 450 at a 10-ha scale). After repeated fires a sample area of 2 ha was needed to reach the same species richness. Regulation-based logging had little impact on tree species richness. In rubber agroforest with low-intensity management beyond rubber planting, 50 tree species were found at a 1-ha scale and close to 100 species in 3 ha. The Kalimantan forest after repeated fires had a markedly higher fraction of low-wood-density trees (40%), but otherwise, all forests sampled were similar in overall wood density profiles. Selectively logged forest managed by a local community (village forest) and rubber agroforest in Sumatra con-tained larger fractions of heavy-wood-density trees. The majority of trees (50%-70%) had birds, bats and primates as dispersal agents in all sites. Selectively logged forests had higher fractions of autochorous species (15%) compared to other sites. Anemochorous (wind-dispersed) species, especially Macaranga lowii, were most common (20%) in lowland dipterocarp forest. Comparison between secondary forests and agroforests showed the influence of farmer selection regarding what is allowed to grow beyond the pole stage. Wood density and seed dispersal profiles can be used as degradation indicators of species assemblages across various disturbance levels and types, as they reflect the habitat quality of the surrounding landscape mosaics.

TI  - Agricultural land reduction due to the compliance with the current Forest Code: a study case of sugarcane production in the State of Sao Paulo
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major reasons of the proposed changes of the Brazilian Forest Code is that its compliance would supposedly harm several agricultural sectors, although this reason has been weakly supported by data. The goal of this work was to evaluate the implication of the compliance with the Forest Code for reducing areas of sugarcane production in the State of sao Paulo, aiming to estimate the upper limit of potential losses that the application of the Forest Code could bring to the economic viability of important sectors of Brazilian agricultural production. We analyzed 23 projects of environmental planning carried out in 1,961 landholdings of sugarcane mills from sac. Paulo State, which totalized 533,097 ha (9.7% of the cultivated area with sugarcane in the state). In these projects, we carried out an environmental zoning of Permanent Protected Areas (PPA), lands of agricultural production, and potential lands to constitute Legal Reserves. The results indicated that, on average, 10.4% of the total area of each farm was classified as PPA, and that only 21.2% of PPA area (2.2% of the total area) were occupied by some kind of agricultural production. Sugarcane occupied, in average, 12.1% of the areas classified as PPA (1.2% of the total area). Overall, 76.5% of the total area of projects was occupied by sugarcane fields and the sum of potential areas for compliance with the Legal Reserve., which were constituted by forest remnants (5.0% of total area), abandoned lands (2.3% of total area), and lands with other uses (6.3% of total area), would result in 13.6% of the total area and consequently generate a deficit of 6.4% of lands for the full compliance with the Legal Reserve (20%). This deficit could even be compensated, by law, outside the landholding register in landscapes with lower agriculture suitability. Therefore, the diagnostics presented in this work for the sugarcane sector in the State of Sao Paulo indicates that compliance with the current Forest Code would not reduce agricultural production, which highlight that part of the arguments that are favorable for changes in the Forest Code need to be revisited in the light of concrete data and in a less speculative way.

TI  - The role of native woody species in the restoration of Campos Rupestres in quarries
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsCan shrub and tree seedlings be reintroduced into an extremely harsh environment through transplantation? Does the growth strategy of species affect their survival? What factors influence transplantation success? Do transplanted species influence their immediate vicinity, e.g. promote native species colonization?LocationCampos Rupestres, Minas Gerais, Brazil.MethodsWe studied the reintroduction of four native tree and 14 native shrub species. Their transplantation success (survival, growth and reproduction) and their impact on their immediate vicinity (understorey composition, soil surface indicators, e.g. cover of moss, biological crust, bare ground, litter, herbaceous cover and soil characteristics) were assessed 4.5yrs after transplantation.ResultsWhile some transplanted species had low survival (<30%), half of them had survival of >78% 4.5yrs after transplantation. Plant growth was barely correlated with transplantation success in such a harsh environment. Transplanted species did not influence soil and understorey plant composition but significantly impacted soil surface indicators. The shrub species with higher survival usually allowed establishment of an understorey herbaceous cover, which may increase soil erosion control. This is also true for some species for which the survival was <40%: Diplusodon orbicularis (survival: 39%) and Lavoisiera campos-portoana (37%). Crown volume had a direct effect on light reaching the soil (e.g. Jacaranda caroba or Collaea cipoensis had a less dense canopy more permeable to light, allowing the development of understorey species). On the other hand, crown volume was positively correlated with amount of litter: Fabaceae, e.g. Chamaecrista semaphora and Mimosa foliolosa, had denser canopy and produced a thick layer of litter, limiting herbaceous species establishment. Three tree species (Enterolobium ellipticum, Kielmeyera petiolaris and Zeyhera tuberculosa) neither had high survival nor facilitated establishment of herbaceous cover. The layout and spacing of species and individuals must thus be considered carefully to ensure recolonization by native shrub and herbaceous species.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the practical efficiency of using some species native to harsh tropical ecosystems, e.g. Campos Rupestres, to restore quarry ecosystems in terms of their transplantation success, effects on both the establishment of herbaceous species and soil conservation.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION MECHANISMS IN A SEASONAL DECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the loss of biodiversity and natural habitat because of the forests fragmentation, it is the needed to find alternatives that allow the recovery of these environments. Thus, this study aimed to obtain information about the potential of natural regeneration mechanisms (seed rain, soil seed bank, seedling bank and established natural regeneration) in a seasonal deciduous forest fragment in Santa Maria - RS state, in order to conserve and to recover these ecosystems. The study was conducted in a systematic way, having as a point of departure the demarcation of 14 sampling plots of 2000 sq m. From those plots, 70 subplots were randomly selected to evaluate the natural regeneration mechanisms. The seed rain was evaluated during one year based on the material that was monthly collected and analyzed from the collectors. To the study of the soil seed bank, soil samplings of 25cmx25cmx5cm were taken and the collected material was monitored during 7 months, observing the seed germination. The natural regeneration was evaluated in two classes: seedling bank and established natural regeneration, where individuals h >= 30 cm and DBH <= 5 cm were identified and measured. The seed rain presented medium density of 1350 seeds m(-2), in which 73 species, predominantly arboreal, were observed. In the soil seed bank, 108 species were observed, in which 74 % were herbaceous. In the seedling bank, 48 species were found and they were heliophilous and sciaphilous species, while in the established natural regeneration, 37 species were found, prevailing sciaphilous. This study concluded that the species with the greatest potential to perpetuate in the studied area were Gymnanthes concolor, Soroceae bonplandii, Eugenia rostrifolia, Trichilia claussenii, Trichilia elegans and Dasyphylum spinescens, and they are highly indicated to the enrichment of the area. The species Myrocarpus frondosus, Cupania vernalis, Nectandra megapotamica and Syagrus rommanzoffiana showed certain restriction, depending on the silvicultural treatments in the forest to assure their perpetuation in the area.

TI  - Coleoptera (Insecta) as forest fragmentation indicators in the Rio Negro sub-region of the Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the integrity of two forest fragments in Rio Negro Pantanal sub-region, using coleopterans as environmental indicators. The study was carried out at Santa Emilia Farm in the Rio Negro sub-region, municipality of Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul (19 degrees 30' 18 '' S and 55 degrees 36' 45 '' W). Two sites were selected, locally denominated as "cordilheiras" (narrow and elongated strands of elevated soil), one with low degree of anthropic disturbance (CL) and the other, currently undergoing restoration process (TD). The sampling sites were determined using a GPS device. Ten pit-fall traps containing water and detergent were used for the specimens sampling, which were screened and identified. Abundance, richness, diversity and similarity were determined. Abundance was higher for CL (n=277) than for TD (n=251). The same was observed for the diversity indices, CL showed H'=2.83 bit. individual(-1) and TD=2.48 bit. individual(-1), confirming the interferences made for abundance. Specimens of ten families were captured in CL area and seven families in TD area, indicating higher richness in CL, when compared to TD. The linear correlation coefficient (p > 0.05) indicates that both areas are significantly different, showing similarity value of 66.7%. The data show that the structure and disturbance degree in the environment integrity influence the composition of beetles fauna, causing the increase of abundance, richness and diversity in anthropogenic environments undergoing the early stage of regeneration.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF ECOLOGICAL GROUP COMPOSITION, PLANTATION SPACING AND ARRANGEMENT IN THE RESTORATION OF RIPARIAN FOREST ON RESERVOIR SHORES
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to assess the effect of spacing, arrangement and ecological group composition of planted seedlings on the restoration process of artificial reservoir shores in southeastern Brazil. The assessments were performed 12 years after the settlement of the experiment in which five mixed stand models were tested. First, a general evaluation of the stand was performed when we surveyed the overstory and understory, seed bank and soil for chemical analysis. Then, the restoration indicators survival of planted trees, basal area and density of the tree community, litter accumulated on the soil and canopy closure index were utilized to compare the plantation models and to assess the influence the experimental factors on these parameters. In the general analysis, we found that the studied stand presents low diversity, poor regeneration, and seed bank dominated mostly by one planted exotic tree species and weeds, which may jeopardize the self-maintenance of the stand in the future. The factor that most influenced the models was the ecological group composition with the best performance found for models in which both pioneer and non-pioneer groups were used. Probably, the plantation arrangement and spacing did not have greater influence due to both plant mortality and natural regeneration that has developed to this age. Hence, it is not recommended the use of only pioneer species in the implantation of riparian forest and the proportion of 50% pioneers and 50% non-pioneers using as much species as possible is indicated for areas that might present constraints for the natural regeneration.

TI  - Soil organic carbon recovery and coffee bean yield following bauxite mining
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bauxite mining requires the removal of the vegetation and topsoil, thus causing considerable impacts on both natural and managed ecosystems. This is typically the case of agricultural activities across Minas Gerais, South-eastern Brazil, where bauxite mining often displaces pastures and coffee plantations. In this study, our objective was to assess the effects of chemical and organic fertilizations combined with cover crops on the re-establishment of coffee plantations following bauxite mining. The experiment consisted of a split-plot design which main plot received 4 types of fertilization: no fertilization, chemical fertilization (CF), poultry litter (PL), and CF+PL. In subplots, 4 cover crops were cultivated in between the rows of the coffee plantation, including: no cover crops, grass (Brachiaria brizantha [B]), legume (Stylosanthes spp. [S]), and B+S. We had 4 blocks as replicates. Organic and chemical fertilization (PL+CF) combined with cover crops (B+S) led to significant recovery of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic nitrogen (SON), and KMnO4-oxidizable SOC. PL+CF and B+S also led to SOC increments of 14.5g kg(-1) soil (0-10-cm depth). Based on isotopic data (C-13), both cover crops, isolated or combined, contributed to the recovery of SOC. Over 3 consecutive harvests, coffee bean yield was consistently above 1,800 kg ha(-1) under PL or PL+CF, except when B was the only cover crop. Managing fertilization and cover crops can determine the recovery of SOC, SON and the capacity of soil to sustain the re-establishment of coffee plantations following bauxite mining.

TI  - Net carbon dioxide exchange in a hyperseasonal cattle pasture in the northern Pantanal wetland of Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is the largest seasonal wetland in the world with a landscape that consists of a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats, and floodable and non-floodable savannas, pastures and forests. Drought events are expected to occur more frequently in the Pantanal biome under future climate conditions, but the effects of land management and hydrological extremes on pastures have been poorly studied at spatial scales relevant to local livestock. In this study, we measured CO2-C fluxes using eddy covariance over a hydrological year on pastures within a cattle farm in the Brazilian Pantanal that experienced seasonal flooding. Our measurements show that seasonally flooded pastures were large emitters of CO2-C, contributing 337 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) to the atmosphere. During flooding, when the soils were anaerobic, and soil O-2 was close to zero, the flooded pasture was a net sink of -18 g CO2-C m(-2), while during the aerobic phase (soil O-2 > 15%) the pasture was a significant CO2 source to the atmosphere (301 g CO2-C m(-2)). Transitions to and from anaerobic conditions corresponded to 54 g CO2-C m(-2). Our results indicate that the seasonally flooded cattle pastures in the Brazilian Pantanal may be an important regional source of CO2-C for the atmosphere. Better management, and use of drought resistant grasses, may be a way to improve soil C stocks and limit emissions, especially as global climate change is anticipated to increase heating and drying for the Pantanal biome.

TI  - Inbreeding depression from selfing and mating among relatives of Hymenaea courbaril L
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inbreeding in trees can result in inbreeding depression (ID), which may affect adaptation and growth of individuals that originate from self-fertilization and mating among relatives. To investigate how inbreeding can affect seed, and seedling growth, we used microsatellite loci to determine the mating system of a Hymenaea courbaril population and assess traits of seeds and seedlings for the expression of ID. Ninety-nine adult trees were mapped and genotyped and seeds collected from eight trees in a forest fragment in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Seed length and weight were measured and germinated seedlings that had been grown under nursery conditions were genotyped and measured for height and root collar diameter (RCD) at two-month intervals (7-17 months of age). Individual fixation index was estimated for each seedling, from which they were classified as originating from mating among unrelated parents (t(u)), related parents (t(r)), or selfing (s). This classification was confirmed using paternity analysis. Phenotypic means and ID of the measured traits were calculated for each determined s, t(r), and s + t(r) group. Mating was not random due to the occurrence of self-fertilization (1.3%), mating among relatives (5%), and correlated mating (15.6%). Biparental inbreeding was attributed to significant spatial genetic structure up to 250 m. The mean fixation index within familieswas significantly higher in seedlings (0.184) than in adults (-0.035), indicating ID from seedling to adult stages. The ID varied among seed and seedling traits throughout the study and between mating groups. Self-fertilization resulted in greater ID for seed length (8.5%) and weight (21.3%) than for t(r) (<7%). The ID for height and RCD of selfed individuals tended to decrease over the course of the study. The values for ID for seedling height and RCD of the group were greater (15.8-25.6% for both traits) than for the group t(r) (3.1-8.2%), with a total (s + t(r)) similar between height (7.6-9.4%) and RCD (8.1-10.5%). We recommend that seed collection is conducted across a large number of forest fragments in the region where the restoration is to be implemented, preferably in forests that are connected or as close as possible to other remnants, to mitigate the effects of ID in future generations. Seeds must be collected from a minimum of 47H. courbaril trees, respecting a minimum distance of 250 m between each tree to avoid collection of seeds from related individuals.

TI  - Protected areas and the neglected contribution of Indigenous Peoples and local communities: Struggles for environmental justice in the Caatinga dry forest
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Despite evidence about the contribution of Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs) to conservation, prevailing strategies still seek their separation from nature, often triggering conflicts. Current pledges to expand global protected area coverage suggest a need for the critical analysis of governance quality and the way conservation interacts with the well-being of IPLCs.2. We present the case of Catimbau National Park in the Caatinga dry forest of northeast Brazil, where we explored connections between the well-being of IPLCs and landscape through different values, practices and institutions, and perceptions of how environmentally just the park's governance has been.3. The well-being of IPLCs is inextricably connected with the Caatinga landscape, through multiple place-based relational values that, although differing between Indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants, have in both cases developed over generations. Although often framed as degraders, IPLCs exhibit a strong motivation to conserve, reflected through local institutions including forest gardens, sustainable use regulations, restoration activities and prevention of external encroachment.4. The strict form of protected area implemented at Catimbau, instead of a locally led or sustainable use reserve, explicitly targeted the resettlement of IPLCs and livelihood reorientation. These imposed objectives have clashed with a way of life in this peopled landscape and precluded local stewardship on a larger scale. Long-term conflict arose through governance deficiencies which sparked multidimensional injustices. These include not only the misrecognition of local values and customary institutions but also the lack of procedures for consent or decision-making influence, plus distributional harms including tenure insecurity and denied development assistance.5. Development and conservation strategies must reject narratives about poor, resource-dependent rural communities and embrace the opportunities that local knowledge and institutions bring for effective conservation. As conservation efforts are expanded post-2020, the people of the Caatinga and beyond must be recognised as embedded and a key part of any solution.6. In strict protected areas like Catimbau, where social conflict constrains their ability to function, seeking legal changes in governance type can be onerous. However, we describe other local-level actions to build relationships and agency that may foster transitions towards better governance, and just treatment of IPLCs.

TI  - STRUCTURE OF THE TREE COMPONENT IN AREAS OF CERRADO IN SAO TOME DAS LETRAS, MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The municipality of Sao Tome das Letras is located in southern Minas Gerais state, in Serra da Mantiqueira, in the Rio Grande basin, in a transition zone between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, where rupestrian fields are also found. The local economic activities are as follows: mineral extraction, agriculture and tourism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the phytosociological structure of three areas of cerrado in the municipality. Sixty quadrant-points were sampled per area by taking measures of height of the trees and trunk circumference at ground level >= 10 cm. The following parameters were calculated for each environment: density of individuals, dominance, frequency, basal area, Importance Value, floristic diversity (Shannon index, H'). Twenty-seven families, 36 genera and 56 species were identified. Eremanthus erythropappus (candeia, Asteraceae) was the species with the highest Importance Value (VI) in Candeias area and Vale das Borboletas area; Stryphnodendron adstringens (barbatimao, Fabaceae) and Piptocarpha rotundifolia (coracaode-negro, Asteraceae) were the species with the highest VI in Carrapatos area. The most abundant species were Eremanthus erythropappus, Miconia albicans, Stryphnodendron adstringens and Myrsine guianensis. The average height ranged from 2.0 +/- 1.2 to 2.3 +/- 1.3m. The average diameter ranged from 6.5 +/- 4.4 to 7.3 +/- 4.8cm. For the three areas, the average density was 2,315 indiv.ha(-1) and median basal area was 13.4 m(2).ha(-1). The Shannon diversity index (H') for species ranged from 2.67 to 2.96 nats/ind. Low similarity among areas was observed. Considering anthropic pressures that natural local environments are suffering, these results can subsidize local projects of the vegetation restoration, mainly of the arboreal component.

TI  - Changes in Gross Primary Production (GPP) over the Past Two Decades Due to Land Use Conversion in a Tourism City
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes in gross primary production (GPP), which is the total carbon fixation by terrestrial ecosystems through vegetation photosynthesis, due to land use conversion in a tourism city is important for carbon cycle studies. Satellite data from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 and meteorological data are used to calculate annual GPP for 1995, 2003 and 2014, respectively, using the vegetation production model (VPM) in the tourism city Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. Five land use types generated from topographic maps in three different years over the past two decades are used to quantify the impacts of land use changes on GPP estimation values. Analysis was performed for two periods to determine changes in land use and GPP value as well as their speed. The results demonstrated that urban land development, namely, the increase of settlement areas due to tourism activity, had overall negative effects on terrestrial GPP. The total GPP of the whole area decreased by 7793.96 tC year(-1) (12.65%) during the study period. The decline is due to the conversion of agriculture and grassland area into settlements, which caused the city to lose half of its ability to uptake carbon through vegetation. However, although forest area is declining, forest maintenance and restoration by making them protection areas has been helpful in preventing a drastic decline in GPP value over the past two decades. This study provides information that is useful for carbon resource management, tourism, policy making and scholars concerned about carbon reduction in a tourism city.

TI  - Smoke radiocarbon measurements from Indonesian fires provide evidence for burning of millennia-aged peat
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to a strong El Nino, fires in Indonesia during September and October 2015 released a large amount of carbon dioxide and created a massive regional smoke cloud that severely degraded air quality in many urban centers across Southeast Asia. Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Nino-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (C-14) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mu m). The Delta C-14 of fire-emitted aerosol was -76 +/- 51 parts per thousand, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 +/- 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (similar to 85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Nino events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments.

TI  - Grazing exclusion restores soil health in Brazilian drylands under desertification process
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian drylands (Caatinga biome) are facing accelerated soil desertification due to human activities (e.g., overgrazing). However, restoration practices (e.g., grazing exclusion), are promising to curb soil desertification and, eventually, increase soil functioning. However, the understanding of soil health (SH) changes, induced by desertification and restoration in the Caatinga biome remains, poorly understood. Here, the SMAF (Soil Man-agement Assessment Framework) was applied to assess the impact of desertification and long-term grazing exclusion on the SH in the Caatinga biome. Three conditions were assessed: i) native vegetation (NV), ii) degraded soil by overgrazing (DE) and iii) restored soil by grazing exclusion (RE). Soil samples (0-10 cm) were collected in both rainy and dry seasons, and chemical (pH, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), K+, and P), physical (bulk soil density), and biological (soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and beta-glucosi-dase activity) indicators were analyzed. Then, integrated soil health indexes (SHI) were calculated using the SMAF algorithms. Briefly, DE reduced (0.44 and 0.47 in rainy and dry seasons, respectively) the SHI compared to NV (0.72 and 0.82 in rainy and dry seasons, respectively). Importantly, RE recovered SH after two decades of implantation (0.65 and 0.79 in rainy and dry seasons, respectively). Bulk soil density and SAR were the in-dicators that presented a higher negative correlation with SH, mainly in DE, while SOC, MBC, and beta-glucosidase activity correlated with SH in NV and RE soils. Biological soil health indicators increased in dry season, which may be due to the deciduous behavior of Caatinga vegetation, which could intensify microbial activity. We provided novel evidence that SMAF can be a user-friendly tool to monitor changes in SH under Brazilian drylands soils. In addition, long-term grazing exclusion can restore SH, contributing to curbing the desertification process in the region.

TI  - Carbon Stock and CO2 Fluxes in Various Land Covers in Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve, North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in coastal areas from an ecological perspective, being able to store large amounts of carbon through sequestration and inhibiting climate change processes by absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere. In recent years, there have been changes in the land cover of converted and degraded mangrove forests which have resulted in the release of carbon and an imbalance in soil structure, which in turn cause a flux of CO2 into the atmosphere. This research was conducted at the Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study focused on six different land covers, namely natural forests, restoration, mixed agriculture, paddy fields, oil palm plantation, and ponds. This study aimed to measure the total carbon stock of mangrove forests that have been converted to other land covers and estimate the level of CO2 flux in the area. A total of three transects and six plots for each land cover were used in this study; for tree biomass, a non-destructive method was used by recording every DBH > 5 cm, and for soil carbon, drilling was carried out, which was divided into five depths in each plot. CO2 flux was measured using an Eosense Eosgp CO2 sensor with the static closed chamber method. The highest carbon stock was found at 308.09 Mg ha(-1) in natural forest, while the lowest 3.22 Mg ha(-1) was found in mixed agriculture. The highest soil carbon was found at 423.59 MgC ha(-1) in natural forest, while the lowest 50.44 MgC ha(-1) was found in mixed agriculture dry land. The highest average CO2 flux value of 1362.24 mgCO(2) m(2) h(-1) was found in mangrove restoration and the lowest in ponds was 123.03 mgCO(2) m(2) h(-1). Overall, the research results inform how much carbon stock is lost when converted to other land covers so that it can be used as a reference for policy makers to provide future management of mangrove forests and develop mitigation measurements to reduce carbon emissions.

TI  - Short-term hydromorphological and ecological responses of using woody structures for river restoration in a tailing-impacted tropical river
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gualaxo do Norte River (GNR), in southeastern Brazil, was impacted by iron ore tailings from the Fundao Dam rupture (November 2015). The deposition of tailings on the riverbed has changed the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of the GNR, resulting in a decrease in the diversity of physical habitats and ecological biodiversity. As part of the process of restoration and management of this damaged ecosystem, the river restoration project ReNaturalize was implemented to restructure the geomorphological characteristics and the physical habitat and to enhance the reestablishment of biota, mainly for macroinvertebrates and fishes. For this goal, 203 wooden structures, such as tree trunks, branches, and grass were installed in two sections of GNR (T6R and T7R), totaling 1.8 km long. The effectiveness of the project was evaluated by an assessment that followed a before and after and control and impacted (BACI) design. Upstream of each Restored reach there is a Control and a Reference reach. Four campaigns were carried out, two before and two after the restoration process. After 14 months of the woody installation, an increase in hydraulic retention in the restored reaches was observed (T6R-20.2%; T7R-63.5%), when compared with the Control reaches, which favored the accumulation of sediments (T6R-388 metric tons; T7R-396 metric tons). This enhanced the formation of natural tailings barriers and promoted the enrichment of substrate types (T6R-39.2%; T7R-43%). The benthic macroinvertebrate community showed an increase in the total abundance (T6-110%), including the most sensitive groups (T6R-124%; T7R-124%). For fish, the increase was up to 81.38% with hand nets capture, indicating the recruitment of juveniles, and the abundance and the biomass of some species were also higher (up to 100%) than the Control reaches. The results indicated that the Restored reach is already qualitatively and quantitatively better than the Control reach and similar to the Reference reach, indicating the success of the study.

TI  - Landscape-scale changes in forest canopy structure across a partially logged tropical peat swamp
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy structure is strongly influenced by environmental factors and disturbance, and in turn influences key ecosystem processes including productivity, evapotranspiration and habitat availability. In tropical forests increasingly modified by human activities, the interplay between environmental factors and disturbance legacies on forest canopy structure across landscapes is practically unexplored. We used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to measure the canopy of old-growth and selectively logged peat swamp forest across a peat dome in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and quantified how canopy structure metrics varied with peat depth and under logging. Several million canopy gaps in different height cross-sections of the canopy were measured in 100 plots of 1 km(2) spanning the peat dome, allowing us to describe canopy structure with seven metrics. Old-growth forest became shorter and had simpler vertical canopy profiles on deeper peat, consistent with previous work linking deep peat to stunted tree growth. Gap size frequency distributions (GSFDs) indicated fewer and smaller canopy gaps on the deeper peat (i.e. the scaling exponent of Pareto functions increased from 1.76 to 3.76 with peat depth). Areas subjected to concessionary logging until 2000, and illegal logging since then, had the same canopy top height as old-growth forest, indicating the persistence of some large trees, but mean canopy height was significantly reduced. With logging, the total area of canopy gaps increased and the GSFD scaling exponent was reduced. Logging effects were most evident on the deepest peat, where nutrient depletion and waterlogged conditions restrain tree growth and recovery. A tight relationship exists between canopy structure and peat depth gradient within the old-growth tropical peat swamp forest. This relationship breaks down after selective logging, with canopy structural recovery, as observed by ALS, modulated by environmental conditions. These findings improve our understanding of tropical peat swamp ecology and provide important insights for managers aiming to restore degraded forests.

TI  - Evaluating the relationship between water quality and water treatment costs with land use change at multiple spatial scales: a case study of watersheds in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current global loss of biodiversity has threatened the provision of drinking water for public supply, mainly due to the loss of native forests. Thus, understanding the impacts of vegetation cover reductions in altered landscapes by human activities is an important action to ensure water security. This study evaluated the relationship between water quality and treatment costs with land use intensifications of six water catchment points for public supply in southern Bahia, Brazil. Six spatial scales were considered, the catchment point and its surroundings (local), four riparian zone buffers (30, 50, 100, and 200 m), and the watershed. A selection of models was conducted to determine the scale at which landscape intensification best explains treatment costs and water quality. By using a principal component analysis in each spatial scale, a gradient of forest replacement by other non-forest uses (PC1) was generated and used as an explanatory variable. As a result, land use intensification at the 100 m riparian zone was the best model for both response variables. Therefore, our study suggests that actions for conservation and restoration of water resources in our study area should consider a riparian zone of at least 100 m on each side of the water bodies to reduce treatment costs in a medium-to- short term. Also, recovering forest cover is a crucial action to manage riparian zones and watersheds.

TI  - Soil recovery of alluvial gold mine spoils in the Peruvian Amazon using Stylosanthes guianensis, a promising cover crop
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The Amazon is an important reservoir of biodiversity and carbon but it is under pressure by multiple threats such as artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). In Peru ASGM has degraded 90,000 ha of old-growth forest since the eighties, leaving vast areas as wastelands. As most ASGM in the region is illegal, efforts to recover degraded areas have been scant. Here we assessed the potential of Stylosanthes guianensis to recover soil health as a first step in the restoration of gold mine spoils in a Native community and a mining concession in Madre de Dios, Peru. We evaluated plant growth and analyzed changes in physical, chemical, and biological soil parameters. After 470 days from sowing, the average plant height was 46.7 cm with a survival rate >50% and yields of 23.9 t ha(-1) and 450 kg ha(-1) of dry biomass and nitrogen, respectively. Multiple soil parameters increased significantly, including cationic exchange capacity (3.3 to 4.0 cmol [+] kg(-1)), soil organic matter (0.03% to 0.39%), soil respiration (0.02 to 0.06 mg CO2 g(-1) d(-1)) and biomass (0.03 to 0.15 mg C g(-1)). Soil macrofauna increased from 2 to 11 taxonomic groups, including ants, considered as soil engineers. Furthermore, S. guianensis increased soil carbon sequestration of impacted areas from 0.004 t C ha(-1) by more than 1650%, up to 0.07 t C ha(-1). These promising findings clearly illustrate S. guianensis potential to kick-start natural succession of Amazonian forests after degradation by ASGM and hence help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Prospects for Governance and Climate Change Resilience in Peatland Management in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Southeast Asia has the most significant tropical peat/peat carbon storage area in the world, with Indonesia being the primary location for much of it. Anthropogenic changes to peatlands have resulted in a threat to these endangered ecosystems; policies that have favored industrial and elite interests above those of local communities have resulted in severe consequences for the environment and public health, not only in Indonesia and its region, but for the world community in terms of contributions to climate change. Decentralization has been seen as a means of sharing authority and accountability with lower government levels and providing additional opportunities for shared governance. Still, there is reason to question the means of these approaches and the results of such efforts. The research question is: What can be learned about the administration's role in leading stakeholder involvement from the case of Indonesian peatland management? The authors utilize outcome additionality as a framework connected to the resilience of peatlands.

TI  - Sediment source fingerprints of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures: A contribution to manage the Paraopeba River basin impacted by the B1 tailings dam collapse
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the origins of sediment transport in river systems is crucial for effective watershed management, especially after catastrophic events. This information is essential for the development of integrated strategies that guarantee water security in river basins. The present study aimed to investigate the rupture of the B1 tailings dam of the C <acute accent>orrego do Feija o mine, which drastically affected the Brumadinho region (Minas Gerais, Brazil). To address this issue, a confluence-based sediment fingerprinting approach was developed through the SedSAT model. Uncertainty was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Estimates of the overall average contributions of each tributary were quantified for each station and annually during the period 2019 - 2021. It was observed that the sampling point PT-09, closest to the dam breach, contributed to almost 80% of the Paraopeba River in 2019. Despite the dredging efforts, this percentage increased to 90% in 2020 due to the need to restore the highly degraded area. Additionally, the main tributaries contributing to sediment increase in the river are Manso River " TT-03 " (almost 36%), associated with an area with a high percentage of urban land use, and Cedro stream " TT-07 " (almost 71%), whose geology promotes erosion, leading to higher sediment concentration. Uncertainties arise from the limited number of available tracers, variations caused by dredging activities, and reduced data in 2020 due to the pandemic. Parameters such as land use, riparian vegetation degradation, downstream basin geology, and increased precipitation are key factors for successfully assessing tributary contributions to the Paraopeba River. The obtained results are promising for a preliminary analysis, allowing the quantification of key areas due to higher erosion and studying how this disaster affected the watershed. This information is crucial for improving decision-making, environmental governance, and the development of mitigating measures to ensure water security. This study is pioneering in evaluating this methodology in watersheds affected by environmental disasters, where restoration efforts are ongoing.

TI  - Tigers Need Cover: Multi-Scale Occupancy Study of the Big Cat in Sumatran Forest and Plantation Landscapes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The critically endangered Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae Pocock, 1929) is generally known as a forest-dependent animal. With large-scale conversion of forests into plantations, however, it is crucial for restoration efforts to understand to what extent tigers use modified habitats. We investigated tiger-habitat relationships at 2 spatial scales: occupancy across the landscape and habitat use within the home range. Across major landcover types in central Sumatra, we conducted systematic detection, non-detection sign surveys in 47, 17x17 km grid cells. Within each cell, we surveyed 40, 1-km transects and recorded tiger detections and habitat variables in 100 m segments totaling 1,857 km surveyed. We found that tigers strongly preferred forest and used plantations of acacia and oilpalm, far less than their availability. Tiger probability of occupancy covaried positively and strongly with altitude, positively with forest area, and negatively with distance-to-forest centroids. At the fine scale, probability of habitat use by tigers across landcover types covaried positively and strongly with understory cover and altitude, and negatively and strongly with human settlement. Within forest areas, tigers strongly preferred sites that are farther from water bodies, higher in altitude, farther from edge, and closer to centroid of large forest block; and strongly preferred sites with thicker understory cover, lower level of disturbance, higher altitude, and steeper slope. These results indicate that to thrive, tigers depend on the existence of large contiguous forest blocks, and that with adjustments in plantation management, tigers could use mosaics of plantations (as additional roaming zones), riparian forests (as corridors) and smaller forest patches (as stepping stones), potentially maintaining a metapopulation structure in fragmented landscapes. This study highlights the importance of a multi-spatial scale analysis and provides crucial information relevant to restoring tigers and other wildlife in forest and plantation landscapes through improvement in habitat extent, quality, and connectivity.

TI  - SOIL FERTILITY OF COAL MINING RECLAIMED AREAS IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF SANTA CATARINA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the objective of analyzing the fertility of soils built over open pit coal mining areas (28 degrees 35'50 '' S e 49 degrees 25'26 '' W) in the city of Sideropolis (SC), two areas of different reclamation ages were selected: area IV and area VI, reclaimed in 2002 and 2003, respectively. A 100m transection was established in the center of each area, where perpendicular 20m transects were tossed at regular intervals of 10m, alternating to the right and to the left, and nine soil samples were collected (0-0,2 m). The nine samples of each group of two consecutive transects were gathered into a compound sample, reducing the sampling universe from 90 to 5 samples of soil for each area. The contents of clay, pH, Phosphorus, Potassium, organic matter, Aluminum, Calcium, Manganese, H + Al, base sum, CTC and base saturation were analyzed. In both areas, the content of clay fell into class three category, the content of organic compound was low, the pH and V% significantly low. Manganese varied from medium to high, BS varied from low to medium and CTC was considered high. In area IV, the content of P was low and Ca varied from medium to low, while in area VI the content of P varied from low to medium and Ca was low. Although differences had been observed among some of the parameters analyzed, they were not severely affected by the reclaimed time of the two areas.

TI  - The first inventory of gullies in the Upper Taquari River Basin (Brazil) and its agreement with land use classes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion represents the most severe soil loss, with far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate site. Assessing the stability of gullies is particularly challenging in tropical regions with sandy soils and limited ac-curate data. Nonetheless, initiating gully inventories is a crucial first step in guiding public policies and con-servation projects. In this study, we focus on the Upper Taquari River Basin (UTRB) situated on the fringes of the Brazilian Pantanal, where extensive erosion occurs in the upper regions and flooding occurs in the plains. We present the first qualitative and quantitative analysis of gullies in this region. Considering the historical context of the UTRB, it has long suffered from land mismanagement, particularly in livestock activities. Our objective was to evaluate the correspondence between gullies and land use classes in the MapBiomas Project, Brazil's most reliable non-governmental land use map, and the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), the official information shared between landowners and public authorities. Thirteen remote-sensed indicators encompassing vegetation, water, soil, and terrain indices were assessed for 2022. Gullies were digitized through visual interpretation of a high-resolution Maxar Vivid Basic 2017 image. The classification was performed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, wherein pixels were classified into three classes: active, intermediate, and stable, based on the degree of vegetation cover and bare soil. The agreement of the gullies with the features of MapBiomas and CAR was also examined. The results revealed an overall accuracy of 96% and a Kappa index of 93% for the pixel classification. In the study area, 2960 gullies were digitized, with 60% classified as active features and only 2% as stable. Furthermore, the MapBiomas algorithm misclassified many pixels with active gullies as pasture. Conversely, the CAR data failed to identify gullies as areas demanding restoration. To address these issues, we recommend revising both land use maps to accurately represent the presence of erosions and improve decision-making that favors efficient conservation efforts of the region. As a further result of our actions, the method described here may prove valuable in formulating restoration plans for other tropical savanna regions.

CP  - IEA Bioenergy Task 38 Meeting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Bioenergy Systems - Impacts of Timing, Issues of Responsibility
CL  - Brussels, BELGIUM
AB  - We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel + FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD + Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL + Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Para - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel + FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDO Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development.

TI  - Diazotrophs Show Signs of Restoration in Amazon Rain Forest Soils with Ecosystem Rehabilitation
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation can be an important source of nitrogen in tropical forests that serve as a major CO2 sink. Extensive deforestation of the Amazon is known to influence microbial communities and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate. However, it is unknown how diazotrophs (nitrogen-fixing microorganisms) respond to deforestation and subsequent ecosystem conversion to agriculture, as well as whether they can recover in secondary forests that are established after agriculture is abandoned. To address these knowledge gaps, we combined a spatially explicit sampling approach with high-throughput sequencing of nifH genes. The main objectives were to assess the functional distance decay relationship of the diazotrophic bacterial community in a tropical forest ecosystem and to quantify the roles of various factors that drive the observed changes in the diazotrophic community structure. We observed an increase in local diazotrophic diversity (alpha-diversity) with a decrease in community turnover (beta-diversity), associated with a shift in diazotrophic community structure as a result of the forest-topasture conversion. Both diazotrophic community turnover and structure showed signs of recovery in secondary forests. Changes in the diazotrophic community were primarily driven by the change in land use rather than differences in geochemical characteristics or geographic distances. The diazotroph communities in secondary forests resembled those in primary forests, suggesting that at least partial recovery of diazotrophs is possible following agricultural abandonment.IMPORTANCE The Amazon region is a major tropical forest region that is being deforested at an alarming rate to create space for cattle ranching and agriculture. Diazotrophs (nitrogen-fixing microorganisms) play an important role in supplying soil N for plant growth in tropical forests. It is unknown how diazotrophs respond to deforestation and whether they can recover in secondary forests that establish after agriculture is abandoned. Using high-throughput sequencing of nifH genes, we characterized the response of diazotrophs' beta-diversity and identified major drivers of changes in diazotrophs from forest-to-pasture and pastureto-secondary-forest conversions. Studying the impact of land use change on diazotrophs is important for a better understanding of the impact of deforestation on tropical forest ecosystem functioning, and our results on the potential recovery of diazotrophs in secondary forests imply the possible restoration of ecosystem functions in secondary forests.

TI  - Spatial and temporal structure of diversity and demographic dynamics along a successional gradient of tropical forests in southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the structure, diversity, and demographic dynamics of tree assemblages in tropical forests is especially important in order to evaluate local and regional successional trajectories.We conducted a long-term study to investigate how the structure, species richness, and diversity of secondary tropical forests change over time. Trees (DBH >= 5 cm) in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil were sampled twice during a 10-year period (2007 and 2017) in six stands (1 ha each) that varied in age from their last disturbance (25, 60, 75, 90, and more than 100 years). We compared forest structure (abundance and basal area), species richness, alpha diversity, demographic rates (mortality, recruitment, and loss or gain in basal area), species composition, spatial beta diversity, and temporal beta diversity (based on turnover and nestedness indices) among stand ages and study years.Demographic rates recorded in a 10-year interval indicate a rapid and dynamic process of species substitution and structural changes. Structural recovery occurred faster than beta diversity and species composition recovery. The successional gradient showed a pattern of species trade-off over time, with less spatial dissimilarity and faster demographic rates in younger stands. As stands grow older, they show larger spatial turnover of species than younger stands, making them more stochastic in relation to species composition. Stands appear to split chronologically to some extent, but not across a straightforward linear axis, reflecting stochastic changes, providing evidence for the formation of a nonequilibrium community.Policy implications. These results reiterate the complexity and variability in forest succession and serve as a reference for the evaluation and monitoring of local management and conservation actions and for defining regional strategies that consider the diversity of local successional trajectories to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures in secondary forests of the Atlantic Forest biome.

TI  - The sound of recovery: Coral reef restoration success is detectable in the soundscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pantropical degradation of coral reefs is prompting considerable investment in their active restoration. However, current measures of restoration success are based largely on coral cover, which does not fully reflect ecosystem function or reef health. Soundscapes are an important aspect of reef health; loud and diverse soundscapes guide the recruitment of reef organisms, but this process is compromised when degradation denudes soundscapes. As such, acoustic recovery is a functionally important component of ecosystem recovery. Here, we use acoustic recordings taken at one of the world's largest coral reef restoration projects to test whether successful restoration of benthic and fish communities is accompanied by a restored soundscape. We analyse recordings taken simultaneously on healthy, degraded (extensive historic blast fishing) and restored reefs (restoration carried out for 1-3 years on previously degraded reefs). We compare soundscapes using manual counts of biotic sounds (phonic richness), and two commonly used computational analyses (acoustic complexity index [ACI] and sound-pressure level [SPL]). Healthy and restored reef soundscapes exhibited a similar diversity of biotic sounds (phonic richness), which was significantly higher than degraded reef soundscapes. This pattern was replicated in some automated analyses but not others; the ACI exhibited the same qualitative result as phonic richness in a low-frequency, but not a high-frequency bandwidth, and there was no significant difference between SPL values in either frequency bandwidth. Furthermore, the low-frequency ACI and phonic richness scores were only weakly correlated despite showing a qualitatively equivalent overall result, suggesting that these metrics are likely to be driven by different aspects of the reef soundscape. Synthesis and applications. These data show that coral restoration can lead to soundscape recovery, demonstrating the return of an important ecosystem function. They also suggest that passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) might provide functionally important measures of ecosystem-level recovery-but only some PAM metrics reflect ecological status, and those that did are likely to be driven by different communities of soniferous animals. Recording soundscapes represents a potentially valuable tool for evaluating restoration success across ecosystems, but caution must be exercised when choosing metrics and interpreting results.

TI  - Carbon emissions from oil palm development on deep peat soil in Central Kalimantan Indonesia
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the 44 million hectares of peatland in the tropics, Indonesia has proportionately the largest area (45%) and carbon content (64%). These carbon-rich peat ecosystems play an important role in regional climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation. The Indonesian Government has enacted numerous regulatory measures since the 1990s aimed at boosting protection of the remaining intact peatland, with a threshold that peat deeper than 3 m must be conserved and cannot be cultivated. Despite these regulatory measures, extensive conversion of peatland to other land uses has occurred, especially largescale palm oil plantation. This study shows that over 40% of palm oil plantations located in the former ExMega Rice Project area (of some 1.04 million hectares) in Central Kalimantan in Indonesia are situated in deep peat areas. We estimate that continuing the present palm oil development practices on deep peat in the Ex-Mega Rice Project area will result in the release of between 93 and 217 megaton carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) over the next 25 years.

TI  - Contrasting communications of sustainability science in the media coverage of palm oil agriculture on tropical peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the denialist narratives of the negative environmental impact of oil palm plantations on tropical peat by the media of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Specifically, we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress, where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made. We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer-reviewed science consensus-view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires. Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism, which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by Elsasser And Dunlap (2!)13). These denialist narratives draw heavily upon information advocated by divergent knowledge communities (Gokkiein 2(16) and appeal to a nationalist sentiment of 'us' - palm oil-producing developing countries - and 'them' - western developed countries producing research critical of the industry. The Malaysian press has most extensively deployed this nationalistic sentiment, whereas the Singaporean media has not actively endorsed or rejected any of the denialist narratives. Our findings suggests that media representation of the issue is a reflection of an amalgamation of economic, diplomatic and nationalistic concerns, determined by political, socio-cultural nuances specific to each country. Importantly, our article alerts to the continuation of unsustainable practices as justified by the media to the public, and that the prevalence of these denialist narratives constitute a significant obstacle in resolving pressing issues such as transboundary haze, biodiversity loss, and land-use change related greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Palynology of sedimentary soils in the Pampa biome: Grassland-forest mosaics and landscape-soil-pollen relationships
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pampa biome vegetation is characterized by extensive areas of native grassland, interspersed with forests close to water courses. An understanding is been searched on how grassland and forest dynamics to contribute for the conservation and management practices suitable for the biome. The objective of this study was to asses if landscape-soil-pollen relationships are determinant of grassland-forest mosaics, by analyzing summit, footslope and toeslope positions in the landscape, in the Campanha region of the Pampa biome. We collected 32 samples in three soil profiles in topossequence under natural grassland of the Pampa biome, in southern Brazil. These samples were treated following standard methodology used in palynology studies. The pollen percentage diagrams were generated to represent the identified pollen set, while cluster analysis was used to define the paleoecological zones. The results found were supported by radiocarbon dating (age of subsurface soil varying from 3,460 to 4,090 calibrated years before present), and particle-size analysis. The paleoecological zones, for each soil profile, indicate a predominance of grassland vegetation, especially Poaceae pollen, whereas Fabaceae and Piper were predominant in forest sites. The pollen set obtained in the three soil profiles indicates hegemony of the sites, even under climatic conditions of increased moisture. Rare pollen grains from forest taxa suggests that trees and shrubs existed in isolated form. The presence of bryophyte spores and taxa associated with soil wetness indicates that the region was once dominated by extensive wetlands and moist landscapes. Our findings enhance the comprehension of the Pampa flora, and are applicable in restoration of degraded areas. The preservation of pollen grains in soil profiles shows the potential of minerals soils to reconstitute Pampa biome vegetation, representing a site for palynological research advance, and demonstrate grassland formations maintain their supremacy even under unfavorable climatic conditions. Thus, this study expands the frontier of palynological work, encompassing new sites and new opportunities to evaluate land use/land cover changes.

TI  - Industry-driven mitigation measures can reduce GHG emissions of palm oil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland stores a large amount of carbon. In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%-34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%-58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18-25 cm compared to 57-73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%-43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%-29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment.

TI  - Mapping peat thickness and carbon stock of a degraded peatland in West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R-2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.

TI  - Indigenous tenure security and local participation in climate mitigation programs: Exploring the institutional gaps of REDD plus implementation in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism faces implementation challenges related to tenure security and governance institutions. In response, multiple regional climate mitigation initiatives have emerged. In Peru, indigenous networks have created their own Indigenous Amazonian REDD (RIA), an initiative aiming to strengthen property rights for native peoples. At roughly the same time, the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Program (PNCB), a conditional payment scheme aiming to encourage sustainable forest management. However, these initiatives must still overcome fragmented institutional governance of forests at the regional scale and continued challenges related to indigenous tenure security. This article examines how indigenous federations and the Peruvian government are attempting to implement these initiatives in the Amazonian region of Madre de Dios to examine how challenges play out in practice. These cases illustrate the institutional gaps between national policies, regional capacities, and local needs and expectations. However, it also demonstrates how an innovative institutional partnership at the subnational scale may be overcoming some of these challenges.

TI  - The potential of REDD plus for carbon sequestration in tropical forests: Supply curves for carbon storage for Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the potential of tropical multi-age multi-species forests for sequestering carbon in response to financial incentives from REDD+. Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - we have provided a framework for identifying least-cost sites for afforestation and reforestation and deriving carbon sequestration cost curves at a global level in a scenario of limited information. Special attention is given to country risk in developing countries and the sensitivity to spatial datasets. Our model results suggest that within 20 years and considering a carbon price of US$50/tC, tree-planting activities could offset 1 year of global carbon emissions in the energy sector. However, if we account for country risk considerations-associated with political, economic and financial risks-carbon sequestration is reduced by approximately 60%. With respect to the geography of supply, illustrated by grid-scale maps, we find that most least-cost sites are located in regions of developing countries such as the Sub-Sahara, Southeast Brazil and Southeast Asia.

TI  - Genome-resolved carbon processing potential of tropical peat microbiomes from an oil palm plantation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Tropical peatlands in South-East Asia are some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world. Extensive repurposing of such peatlands for forestry and agriculture has resulted in substantial microbially-driven carbon emissions. However, we lack an understanding of the microorganisms and their metabolic pathways involved in carbon turnover. Here, we address this gap by reconstructing 764 sub-species-level genomes from peat microbiomes sampled from an oil palm plantation located on a peatland in Indonesia. The 764 genomes cluster into 333 microbial species (245 bacterial and 88 archaeal), of which, 47 are near-complete (completeness >= 90%, redundancy <= 5%, number of unique tRNAs >= 18) and 170 are substantially complete (completeness >= 70%, redundancy <= 10%). The capacity to respire amino acids, fatty acids, and polysaccharides was widespread in both bacterial and archaeal genomes. In contrast, the ability to sequester carbon was detected only in a few bacterial genomes. We expect our collection of reference genomes to help fill some of the existing knowledge gaps about microbial diversity and carbon metabolism in tropical peatlands.

TI  - Sustainable development of carbon sinks? Lessons from three types of peatland partnerships in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland conversion for agriculture is the leading cause of Indonesia's terrestrial carbon emissions that contribute substantially to global warming. Indonesia's peatlands contain 55-57 billion tonnes of carbon, the equivalent of almost 2 years of global carbon emissions at existing rates. This paper examines initiatives to retain soil-based carbon in Indonesia's province of Riau, where over half the surface area is composed of agriculturally productive peatlands. We qualitatively evaluate three types of partnership programmes (bilateral, co-governed and internationally funded local initiatives) in Riau aimed at the sustainable development of peatlands. The article finds that carbon loss is likely to persist in all case studies. Public, private and civil society actors in each partnership have exploited funding and political opportunities to advance agendas not directly related to the environment. The administrative category of the peatland hydrological unit as an ecologically meaningful scale of peatland governance is also under-utilised by the partnerships studied.

TI  - Mangroves, fauna compositions and carbon sequestration after ten years restoration on Flores Island, Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation's long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 - 70.02 Mg CO2 ha- 1 and stored 30.54 x 104 - 54.07 x 104 MJ ha- 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 +/- 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 +/- 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features.

TI  - Monitoring deforestation in Malaysia between 1985 and 2013: Insight from South-Western Sabah and its protected peat swamp area
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land cover changes provides an effective and accurate evaluation of deforestation rates that shed light on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) implementation. Located in Klias Peninsula, southwestern Sabah, Malaysia there lies a pristine peat swamp forest area. This type of ecosystem plays a significant role in global climate regulation. Despite its importance, the peat swamp forest is threatened and highly degraded, due to the increasing demand for agricultural expansion. This is where we monitored deforestation and land cover change between 1985 and 2013. Temporal changes were determined by means of supervised classification, using the maximum likelihood classification rule to observe changes in the area. Post-classification change detection techniques were applied in order to understand the change in forest coverage in the Klias Peninsula and inside the protected area boundaries. The overall accuracy for the Klias Peninsula and the protected area were more than 88% (+/- 4% margin of error) and 95% (+/- 2% margin of error), respectively. Based on these findings, it appears that more than half of the forest area in Klias Peninsula disappeared from 142,713 ha (+/- 6818 margin of error) to 73,403 ha (+/- 6796 margin of error) between 1985 and 2013. The annual rate of change in the protected area was 10.94% (+/- 0.85% margin of error) per year for deforestation and 0.86% (+/- 5.19% margin of error) per year for forest area. The result revealed that most of the peat swamp forest was converted to other stable non-forest areas, including agriculture which can be a threat to the already disturbed protected area. Therefore, we also conducted an accurate monitoring of the forest cover change and deforestation data in the protected area and its surrounding environs in order to promote sound political decision-making regarding the future protection and sustainability of the remaining peat swamp area.

TI  - Effect of strategies for controlling spontaneous plants on the quality of soil organic matter and soil fertility
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) and the chemical attributes of the soil are important indicators of soil quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of strategies for controlling spontaneous plants on SOM quality and soil fertility in an area of forest under restoration. Three methods for controlling spontaneous plants were established: i) mechanical (MCH), ii) chemical (CHM), and iii) chemical-cultural (CC), and evaluated using a randomized block design. After 13 months, soil samples were collected (0-10 cm) to determine basal respiration over 21 days, total organic carbon (TOC), labile carbon (LC), chemical fractions of the SOM [humine (H), humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA)], and soil fertility. On days 1, 3, and 7, higher values were seen for basal soil respiration, however, no differences were found between the control strategies. There was a small change in SOM quality and soil fertility. MCI I showed higher values (up to 11%) for LC, due to the intense silvicultural management. After 13 months of application, each of the strategies for controlling spontaneous vegetation proved to be favorable in relation to SOM quality and soil fertility, especially for LC, due to its relationship with the accumulation or loss of SOM, and immediate response to changes in land use or management.

TI  - Mangroves, fauna compositions and carbon sequestration after ten years restoration on Flores Island, Indonesia.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation's long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 - 70.02 Mg CO2 ha- 1 and stored 30.54 x 104 - 54.07 x 104 MJ ha- 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 [plus or minus] 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 [plus or minus] 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features.

TI  - Carbon accumulation rates recorded in the last 150 years in tropical high mountain peatlands of the Atlantic Rainforest, SE - Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are environmental matrices that store large amounts of organic carbon (TOC) and work as records of environmental changes. Recent record of organic carbon accumulated were assessed in two Forest National Parks, Itatiaia and Serra dos Orgaos in the Southeastern of Brazil. Based on organic and inorganic characterization, the cores from peatlands presented a predominance of organic material in an advanced stage of decomposition and those soils were classified as typical Haplosaprists Histosols. The combination of favorable topographic and climatic conditions led to rapid C accumulation across coastal mountain in the tropical peatlands studied, presenting an average accumulation rate of C, in the last century, of 194 g C m(-2) yr(-1) about 7 higher times than the rate found in boreal and subarctic peatlands, those higher values may be related to changes in the hydrological cycle occurred since 1950s.

TI  - Modelling Deforestation and Land Cover Transitions of Tropical Peatlands in Sumatra, Indonesia Using Remote Sensed Land Cover Data Sets
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southeast Asia land use change associated with forest loss and degradation is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is of particular concern where deforestation occurs on peat soils. A business-as-usual (BAU) land change model was developed using Dinamica EGO (c) for a REDD+ Demonstration Activity area in south-east Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia containing Berbak National Park (NP). The model output will be used as baseline land change predictions for comparison with alternative land cover management scenarios as part of a REDD+ feasibility study. The study area is approximately 376,000 ha with approximately 50% on peat soils. The model uses published 2000 and 2010 land cover maps as input and projects land cover change for thirty years until 2040. The model predicted that under a BAU scenario the forest area, 185,000 ha in 2010, will decline by 37% by 2040. In protected forest areas, approximately 50% of the study area, forest cover will reduce by 25%. Peat swamp forest will reduce by almost 37%. The greatest land cover category increases are plantation/regrowth areas (which includes oil palm) and open areas which each increase by 30,000 ha. These results indicate that the site has great potential as an Indonesian REDD+ Demonstration Activity.

TI  - Guiding seed movement: environmental heterogeneity drives genetic differentiation in Plathymenia reticulata, providing insights for restoration
T2  - AOB PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and landscape restoration is one of the main strategies for overcoming the environmental crisis. This activity is particularly relevant for biodiversity-rich areas threatened by deforestation, such as tropical forests. Efficient long-term restoration requires understanding the composition and genetic structure of native populations, as well as the factors that influence these genetic components. This is because these populations serve as the seed sources and, therefore, the gene reservoirs for areas under restoration. In the present study, we investigated the influence of environmental, climatic and spatial distance factors on the genetic patterns of Plathymenia reticulata, aiming to support seed translocation strategies for restoration areas. We collected plant samples from nine populations of P. reticulata in the state of Bahia, Brazil, located in areas of Atlantic Forest and Savanna, across four climatic types, and genotyped them using nine nuclear and three chloroplast microsatellite markers. The populations of P. reticulata evaluated generally showed low to moderate genotypic variability and low haplotypic diversity. The populations within the Savanna phytophysiognomy showed values above average for six of the eight evaluated genetic diversity parameters. Using this classification based on phytophysiognomy demonstrated a high predictive power for genetic differentiation in P. reticulata. Furthermore, the interplay of climate, soil and geographic distance influenced the spread of alleles across the landscape. Based on our findings, we propose seed translocation, taking into account the biome, with restricted use of seed sources acquired or collected from the same environment as the areas to be restored (Savanna or Atlantic Forest).In this manuscript, we consider that efforts to restore degraded environments may prove ineffective if they overlook the fundamental aspect of Biodiversity: Genetic Diversity. Therefore, to offer insights into Ecosystem Restoration, we investigated a tropical species, Plathymenia reticulata , a species that helps restore two important global biodiversity hotspots, the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. We report the level of Genetic Diversity in the species, demonstrate how this diversity is distributed and test predictors to elucidate the strong genetic structure found among the remaining populations of P. reticulata . Additionally, we offer recommendations for the conservation of the Plathymenia genus and its remaining populations. It is crucial to recognize that restoration strategies cannot exist in isolation; they must incorporate genetic approaches to facilitate the reconstruction of robust and resilient communities.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF GROWTH AND GAS EXCHANGE OF PLANTS Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) DC IN FLOODING FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE RIPARIAN FORESTS
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to select species for using in the restoration of riparian forests on the banks of the Sao Francisco River, in the state of Sergipe, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the growth and gas exchange of plants Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) D. C., subject to flooding conditions in the nursery. The experiment was conducted at Forest Nursery, Department of Forest Sciences, Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), the municipality of Sao Cristovao, (11 degrees 01 'S latitude and 37 degrees 12' longitude W, altitude 20 m), state of Sergipe, Brazil, from October 2006 to January 2007 under ambient conditions. We used a completely randomized design (CRD), factorial (2x7), two treatments (control - T0, plants at field capacity and flooded - T1) and days after flooding (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days). To simulate the condition of flooding, the plants were placed in plastic pots of black color with a volume of 5 L and more substrate. Following these pots were attached to pots with a volume of 10 L, which was added water until it reaches a water depth of 5 cm above the top of the plants. The control plants kept in pots with a volume of 5 L substrate maintained at field capacity. In non-destructive variables were used four replicates per treatment evaluated every fifteen days, where each replicate consists of six plants, totaling 24. Destructive variables used were 4 replicates per treatment, determined biweekly from 15 days after flooding, where each replicate consists of a plant totaling 24 plants. Therefore, 48 plants were used per treatment. The non-destructive variables were height, diameter and number of leaves. While the destructive variables analyzed were dry weight of roots, dry weight of shoots and dry weight of root / shoot ratio. In addition, we carried out analysis of gas exchange on a monthly basis and evaluated twelve plants per treatment, with two sampling leaves, fully expanded, per plant. The biometric variables were subjected to analysis of variance and subsequently the average test (Tukey p < 0.05), while the values of gas exchange were taken from the standard deviations of the mean. Thus, we observe that the flooding caused a reduction in height and dry mass of root / shoot ratio, from 30 days after treatment application. In addition, flooded plants showed morphological changes such as hypertrophy of adventitious roots and lenticels, characteristics of species tolerant to flooding. The net photosynthetic rate has been reduced by 48.20% compared to control after 60 days. However, despite reductions in growth variables and gas exchange species Lonchocarpus sericeus showed promise in the recovery of riparian vegetation, due to its morphological characteristics of species tolerant to flooding.

TI  - Landscape structure aiming at the biodiversity conservation of urbanized landscape
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that urban sprawl and the increase in anthropogenic activities lead to natural habitats loss and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity, the conservation of urban forest remnants is extremely important for the persistence of native fauna and flora species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the landscape structure of an urbanized area in the Atlantic Forest biome, using geoprocessing techniques and fundamentals of Landscape Ecology, in order to provide subsidies for forest conservation in the urban landscape. A land use/land cover map was used to quantify forest cover and to evaluate the landscape structure. Landscape metrics quantified the area, shape and proximity of the forest remnants, providing indicators of the landscape structure. Forest covers 22.9% of the study area, with only 3.6% of the fragments larger than 50 ha. The majority of the fragments (83%) has an area of less than 10 ha. Only three remnants are larger than 500 ha, the largest of them is located in Ipanema National Forest. Most forest fragments (80%) are located in particular properties. The landscape was diagnosed as highly anthropized and fragmented, but with remnants close to each other (NEAR < 50m) potentiating the movement of species in the anthropic matrix. Scenarios of exclusion of small fragments demonstrated the fragility of the matrix without their support, since the small remnants contribute to the connection between the larger ones. The anthropic grassland is the second largest land use class in the study area (20.4%), behind only the urbanized area (25%). Actions to maintain biodiversity in anthropized landscapes such as the study area should prioritize the restoration of anthropic grasslands, incentives for forest conservation in private properties and the maintenance of small fragments in the landscape, in order to promote the connection between large forest areas. Urban and environmental planning of cities should be aligned and based on scientific studies on the spatialization of the vegetation in urban areas.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of REDD+ Interventions on Household Forest Revenue in Peru
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - REDD+ was conceived as a system of incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and "do no harm" to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue. However, by using a BACI study design and matching, we show that this decrease was not caused by the REDD+ interventions. Thus, REDD+ "did no harm" to local people, at least in terms of forest revenues in the early phases of these two projects in the Peruvian Amazon.

TI  - Towards circular and sustainable restoration of a deeply polluted river basin: The Odiel River catchment (SW Spain)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ria de Huelva estuary located in SW Spain is heavily polluted by acid mine drainage leachates and phosphate fertilizer industry effluents. This study assesses the effectiveness of a solid waste rich in calcite originated during the remediation of industrial effluents using the passive dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS) technology, for the treatment of highly acid and polluted mine drainages. The research consists of flowing the mine leachates through a column loaded with a combination of an alkaline reagent (i.e., calcite-rich waste resulting from the treatment of industrial leachates) scattered in a non-reactive matrix (i.e., wood chips) to increase the pH of acidic water while decreasing the solubility of dissolved pollutants. The alkaline treatment achieved average removal percentages of 100 % for Al and Fe, and close to 90 % for Cu. However, the treatment was not effective for other metals present in mine drainages such as Co and Ni. These results are comparable to those achieved in the DAS treatment with commercial limestone. The precipitation of oxyhydroxysulfates (i.e., schwertmannite and basaluminite) and carbonates (i.e., malachite and hydrozincite) minerals could be controlling the solubility of pollutants during the treatment. The solid wastes from the DAS treatment were subjected to two standardized leaching tests (EN 12457-2 from the European Union and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) from the United States) in order to ensure suitable management and avoid potential environmental impacts. According to European Union legislation, the high mobility of Cu, Zn and SO4 confers some solid wastes from the DAS treatment the hazardous waste classification. However, according to United States regulation, these same solids are considered non-hazardous wastes. This research could help to improve the environmental sustainability of acid mine drainage treatment with DAS technology by replacing marketable limestone with a low-cost alkaline waste.

For Indonesia, which holds among the largest area of tropical peatlands and mangrove forest in the world, it is particularly important for these high - carbon ecosystems to produce high - accuracy greenhouse gas inventory and to improve national forest reference emissions level/forest reference level. Here, we highlight the opportunity for refining greenhouse gas emission factors (EF) of peatlands and mangroves and describe scientific challenges to support climate policy processes in Indonesia, where 55 to 59% of national emission reduction targets by 2030 depend on mitigation in Forestry and Other Land Use. Based on the stock - difference and flux change approaches, we examine higher - tier EF for drained and rewetted peatland, peatland fires, mangrove conversions, and mangrove on peatland to improve future greenhouse gas flux reporting in Indonesia. We suggest that these refinements will be essential to support Indonesia in achieving Forest and Other Land Use net sink by 2030 and net zero emissions targets by 2060 or earlier.

TI  - Forestry projects under the clean development mechanism? Modelling of the uncertainties in carbon mitigation and related costs of plantation forestry projects
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.

TI  - Holocene vegetation and fire dynamics in central-eastern Brazil: Molecular records from the Pau de Fruta peatland
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical climate dynamics play a major role in the global climate system. Precipitation patterns in the Serra do Espinhaco Meridional (Minas Gerais, Brazil) are influenced by both the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This makes the area important for the interpretation of climate dynamics. The composition of the Holocene Pau de Fruta peat deposit was analysed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Molecular records agreed well with delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, C content and mineral content, and pollen records. Changes in peatland plant species composition and fire occurrence indicated several wet and dry periods for the Pau de Fruta peatland during the Holocene; from the beginning of the Holocene to 7400 cal yr BP (phase I; dry and cold), from 7400 to 4200 cal yr BP (phase II; wet and warm), from 4200 to 1000 cal yr BP (phase III; dry and warm), from 1000 to 400 cal yrBP (phase IV; wet and warm) and from 400 cal yr BP to the present (V). The hydrological shifts showed a chronology comparable with that described in other palaeoclimatic studies for central-eastern Brazil, indicating that local conditions agree with regional ones. Analytical Py of the peat deposit provided a multi-proxy record via the identification of specific markers for both peatland plants (vegetation) and charred material (fire), whereas the general chemistry provided information on the degree of decomposition of the organic matter. Molecular chemistry of the peat core sampled at high resolution provided insight into peatland C dynamics, which is important for the interpretation of C sequestration in tropical peatlands. Molecular aspects accurately reflected local environmental change. The general agreement of Py data with pollen and inorganic chemistry supports the use of the molecular approach, because it provides local proxy indicators for peatlands, avoiding a mixture of local and regional signals.

TI  - The AFOLU sector's role in national decarbonization: a comparative analysis of low-GHG development pathways in Brazil, India and Indonesia
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection.

TI  - Sundaland Peat Carbon Dynamics and Its Contribution to the Holocene Atmospheric CO2 Concentration
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sunda Shelf is a large submerged extension of the continental shelf of mainland Asia, joining the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and forming the shallow seabed of the South China Sea. Recent studies identified present-day peatlands in Southeast Asia as a globally important carbon reservoir. However, little is known about Sundaland paleopeatlands and their role in the global carbon cycle since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a topography-based, sea level-driven model, we estimate the potential spatial extent of peatlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene across the low-lying Sundaland plains. We then use the estimated peatland area together with data on carbon accumulation rates to calculate the total peat carbon pool on the Sunda Shelf. Finally, using a global biogeochemical model, we analyze the relative influence of the predicted Sundaland peat dynamics and other carbon change mechanisms, specifically high-latitude forest growth and peat formation, shallow sea carbonate deposition, ocean warming, and combinations of them, on the global carbon cycle of the Holocene. We identify a feedback mechanism between sea level and peatland carbon sequestration in Sundaland that reduced atmospheric CO2 concentration by about 4-5 ppm and increased C-13 by 0.05 during the Holocene. We also show that a concurrence of mechanisms that includes Sundaland peat dynamics produces model results that are consistent with proxy records, especially with respect to C-13.

TI  - Net anthropic removal of atmospheric carbon in Pinus taeda L.plantations
T2  - Cientifica (Jaboticabal)
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate by means of a simulated CDM project the net removal of atmospheric carbon by Pinus taeda plants occupying an area of 7,000 hectares located in the southern region of the state of Parana, Brazil. The CDM forest project was simulated according to the criteria in version 3 of the Approved Afforestation/Reforestation Methodology AR-AM0005 of the UNFCCC. To this end, two scenarios were created : first, a reforestation scenario characterized by planting Pinus taeda with initial density of 2,500 individuals per hectare, followed by plant thinning at 8, 11, 15, and 20 and clear-cutting at 30 years of age and second, a baseline scenario, that is, a pasture area with no isolated trees. All the calculations and estimates required for simulation of the CDM forest project were carried out by the tool TARAM v. 1.3. The simulation of the CDM forest project resulted in the estimation of 591,475 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) removed by the pinus plants this value corresponding to 19,716 tCO2e year(-1) and to 2.82 tCO2e year(-1) ha(-1). This estimate was gained from the results of the baseline net carbon removal (1,810,213 tCO2e), the actual net carbon removal (2,407,820 tCO2e) and leakage of the project (6,133 tCO2e). It was concluded that the CDM forest project simulated in the present study is additional with regard to net anthropic carbon removal, highlighting that modifications in the premises related to the baseline, the reforestation, the leakages of the project, among others, can bring about modifications in the estimates of net anthropic carbon removal and, consequently, change the additionality of the project.

TI  - Land cover distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 with changes since 1990
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Insular Southeast Asian peatlands have experienced rapid land cover changes over the past decades inducing a variety of environmental effects ranging from regional consequences on peatland ecology, biodiversity and hydrology to globally significant carbon emissions. In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and smallholder dominated areas) cover 50% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.

TI  - Who should be governed to reduce deforestation and how? Multiple governmentalities at the REDD plus negotiations
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on recent multiple governmentality literature, this article analyses the REDD+ negotiations to interrogate who the scheme is likely to govern and how. Two arguments are advanced. First, REDD+ is likely to target local forest users at the expense of both corporate and international drivers of deforestation. This will reduce the effectiveness of the scheme and invite leakage issues. In elucidating the ultimately rejected strategies for addressing international drivers now hidden in neat negotiation outcomes, this article opens a space for considering how the scheme could move beyond a predominant focus on local forest users. Second, targeted forest users are likely to be governed by a combination of neoliberal and disciplinary technologies. REDD+ will seek to 'improve' their conduct through a three-staged process involving education, self-reflection and rewards for carbon sequestration. An alternative governmentality associated with local forest users' claims to decide on REDD+ implementation and governance, on the other hand, met with resistance and ultimately received no protection in the adopted REDD+ safeguards. Moreover, the formulation of the safeguards could undermine legitimacy and forest stewardship in REDD+ projects. By linking the possibility of such issues to the negotiation outcomes, this article demonstrates necessary changes to the scheme.

TI  - Uncertainty in establishing forest reference levels and predicting future forest-based carbon stocks for REDD
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest reference levels (FRLs) provide a benchmark for assessing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), and they are central to demonstrate additionality of REDD+. Attaining realistic FRLs, however, is challenging, especially in complex mosaic landscapes. We established FRLs in northern Laos for different reference periods and tested them against actual carbon stock changes. Annual time series of Landsat satellite images were used to capture the subtle changes in carbon stocks in complex landscapes characterized by shifting cultivation. We found that FRLs differ considerably depending on the reference period chosen. Abrupt land-use changes occurred when hybrid maize replaced traditional shifting cultivation and forests, and this invalidated carbon stock trends that would have been predicted had the FRL been projected into the future. We conclude that demonstrating additionality of REDD+ in fast developing areas is difficult and that payment systems rewarding potential emission reductions against hypothetical extrapolation of FRLs are unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy.

TI  - Impacts of fire and prospects for recovery in a tropical peat forest ecosystem
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled fires place considerable burdens on forest ecosystems, compromising our ability to meet conservation and restoration goals. A poor understanding of the impacts of fire on ecosystems and their biodiversity exacerbates this challenge, particularly in tropical regions where few studies have applied consistent analytical techniques to examine a broad range of ecological impacts over multiyear time frames. We compiled 16 y of data on ecosystem properties (17 variables) and biodiversity (21 variables) from a tropical peatland in Indonesia to assess fire impacts and infer the potential for recovery. Burned forest experienced altered structural and microclimatic conditions, resulting in a proliferation of nonforest vegetation and erosion of forest ecosystem properties and biodiversity. Compared to unburned forest, habitat structure, tree density, and canopy cover deteriorated by 58 to 98%, while declines in species diversity and abundance were most pronounced for trees, damselflies, and butterflies, particularly for forest specialist species. Tracking ecosystem property and biodiversity datasets over time revealed most to be sensitive to recurrent high - intensity fires within the wider landscape. These megafires immediately compromised water quality and tree reproductive phenology, crashing commercially valuable fish populations within 3 mo and driving a gradual decline in threatened vertebrates over 9 mo. Burned forest remained structurally compromised long after a burn event, but vegetation showed some signs of recovery over a 12 - y period. Our findings demonstrate that, if left uncontrolled, fire may be a pervasive threat to the ecological functioning of tropical forests, underscoring the importance of fire prevention and long - term restoration efforts, as exemplified in Indonesia.

AB  - Restoration through re-vegetation activities is one of the solutions to recover degraded peatlands quickly. Shorea balangeran is one of the most promising species of Dipterocarpaceae that can be chosen for the degraded peatlands rehabilitation. The bagworm is one of the potential pests to damage the S. balangeran in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) regency. The objective of the study was to provide various information about bagworm insect pests on S. balangeran. Two measuring plots of 50 x 32 m laid on 2017 planted S. balangeran in agrosilvofishery based on integrated peat restoration pilot project. The variables observed were the number of attacked plants to calculate incidence and the number of attacked leaves in each observation unit (tree) using a scoring system to calculate the intensity. The data obtained were analyzed by descriptive quantitatively. The results showed that there were two species of bagworm in S. balangeran. The incidence of both bagworms was quite high, but the intensity of damage was still relatively mild. However, control measures for bagworms still need to be carried out.

TI  - Land use changes, green house gas emissions, and rehabilitation model of native tree species towards sustainable management
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tropical peatlands play a crucial role in the global ecosystem. These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carb & oacute;n dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from conversion of peat swamp forest to oil palm plantation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of tropical peat swamp forest to drainage-based agriculture alters greenhouse gas (GHG) production, but the magnitude of these changes remains highly uncertain. Current emissions factors for oil palm grown on drained peat do not account for temporal variation over the plantation cycle and only consider CO2 emissions. Here, we present direct measurements of GHGs emitted during the conversion from peat swamp forest to oil palm plantation, accounting for CH4 and N2O as well as CO2. Our results demonstrate that emissions factors for converted peat swamp forest is in the range 70-117 t CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (95% confidence interval, CI), with CO2 and N2O responsible for ca. 60 and ca. 40% of this value, respectively. These GHG emissions suggest that conversion of Southeast Asian peat swamp forest is contributing between 16.6 and 27.9% (95% CI) of combined total national GHG emissions from Malaysia and Indonesia or 0.44 and 0.74% (95% CI) of annual global emissions.

TI  - Investigating biodiversity trends in different mitigation scenarios with a national integrated assessment model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in climate mitigation pathways is critical and can be reached by assessing their consequences through the deployment of appropriate indicators to that end. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools for understanding possible impacts caused by adopting new policies. We investigate terrestrial biodiversity trends (life on land: SDG 15) for three different climate mitigation scenarios for Brazil: (1) A scenario compatible with a world that maintains its current policies with current deforestation rates in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes; (2) A scenario in which Brazil fulfils its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); and (3) A scenario compatible with a world that limits warming to 1.5 & DEG;C. We use the Brazilian Land-Use and Energy System model (BLUES), a national IAM, to show the implications of the transitions involved in the above-mentioned scenarios for the country up to 2050. We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses. We conclude that Brazil has the opportunity to align its biodiversity and climate goals through nature-based solutions (NBS), such as forest conservation, restoration, pasture recovery, and the use of crop-pasture and agroforestry systems.

TI  - Global reforestation and biodiversity conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of forest is a leading cause of species extinction, and reforestation is 1 of 2 established interventions for reversing this loss. However, the role of reforestation for biodiversity conservation remains debated, and lacking is an assessment of the potential contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation globally. We conducted a spatial analysis of overlap between 1,550 forest-obligate threatened species' ranges and land that could be reforested after accounting for socioeconomic and ecological constraints. Reforestation on at least 43% (similar to 369 million ha) of reforestable area was predicted to potentially benefit threatened vertebrates. This is approximately 15% of the total area where threatened vertebrates occur. The greatest opportunities for conserving threatened vertebrate species are in the tropics, particularly Brazil and Indonesia. Although reforestation is not a substitute for forest conservation, and most of the area containing threatened vertebrates remains forested, our results highlight the need for global conservation strategies to recognize the potentially significant contribution that reforestation could make to biodiversity conservation. If implemented, reforestation of similar to 369 million ha would also contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation, offering a way to achieve multiple sustainability commitments at once. Countries must now work to overcome key barriers (e.g., unclear revenue streams, high transaction costs) to investment in reforestation.

TI  - Bayesian state-space synthetic control method for deforestation baseline estimation for forest carbon credits
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DATA SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon credits from the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) projects have been criticized for issuing junk carbon credits due to invalid ex-ante baselines. Recently, the concept of ex-post baseline has been discussed to overcome the criticism, while ex-ante baseline is still necessary for project financing and risk assessment. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian state-space model that integrates ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic baseline updating in a unified manner. Our approach provides a tool for appropriate risk assessment and performance evaluation of REDD+ projects. We apply the proposed model to a REDD+ project in Brazil and show that it may have had a small, positive effect but has been overcredited. We also demonstrate that the 90% predictive interval of the ex-ante baseline includes the ex-post baseline, implying that our ex-ante estimation can work effectively.Impact StatementOur novel approach estimates deforestation baselines for forest carbon credits, addressing criticisms of junk carbon credit issued from REDD+ projects and problems of early financing simultaneously. By integrating ex-ante baseline projection and ex-post dynamic updating, we evaluate ex-ante risks and ex-post project performance in a unified manner. Our approach can contribute to sound allocation of funds for forest conservation projects with significant positive impacts on climate change action.

T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Paulo Moutinho(dagger 1), Osvaldo Stella Martins', Mariana Christovam(1), Andre Lima(1), Daniel Nepstad(1) & Ana Carolina Crisostomo(1) Brazil has exercised a leadership in the International scene about climate change mitigation and adaptation. Internally, it has been demonstrating institutional, legal and technical capacity to monitor and reduce deforestation in the Amazon, capacities also required to the development of a national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) system. In this article, we present the progress on the REDD+ debate under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Brazilian government trajectory towards a positive REDD+ agenda. We also discuss the relevant Brazilian legislation that can support a REDD+ regime: the National Policy for Climate Change, the Amazon state plans for deforestation reduction and the current debate and proposal of a REDD+ regime in Brazil, discussing their contexts, threats and opportunities. Funding opportunities are also discussed, with emphasis on the role of the Amazon Fund on fostering the REDD+ activities in Brazil. At the end, we propose a mechanism of REDD+ benefits sharing, based on a stock-target and flow approach.

TI  - Importance of bistatic SAR features from TanDEM-X for forest mapping and monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are one of the important sources for human induced carbon dioxide emissions and their rates are highest in tropical forests. For man-kind, it is of great importance to track land-use conversions like deforestation, e.g. for sustainable forest management and land use planning, for carbon balancing and to support the implementation of international initiatives like REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors are suitable to reliably and frequently monitor tropical forests due to their weather independence. The TanDEM-X mission (which is mainly aimed to create a unique global high resolution digital elevation model) currently operates two X-band SAR satellites, acquiring interferometric SAR data for the Earth's entire land surface multiple times. The operational mission provides interferometric data as well as mono- and bistatic scattering coefficients. These datasets are homogenous, globally consistent and are acquired in high spatial resolution. Hence, they may offer a unique basic dataset which could be useful in land cover monitoring.Based on first datasets available from the TanDEM-X mission, the main goal of this research is to investigate the information content of TanDEM-X data for mapping forests and other land cover classes in a tropical peatland area. More specifically, the study explores the utility of bistatic features for distinguishing between open and closed forest canopies, which is of relevance in the context of deforestation and forest degradation monitoring. To assess the predominant information content of TanDEM-X data, the importance of information derived from the bistatic system is compared against the monostatic case, usually available from SAR systems. The usefulness of the TanDEM-X mission data, i.e. scattering coefficients, derived textural information and interferometric coherence is investigated via a feature selection process. The resulting optimal feature sets representing a monostatic and a bistatic SAR dataset were used in a subsequent classification to assess the added value of the bistatic TanDEM-X features in the separability of land cover classes. The results obtained indicated that especially the interferometric coherence significantly improved the separability of thematic classes compared to a dataset of monostatic acquisition. The bistatic coherence was mainly governed by volume decorrelation of forest canopy constituents and carries information about the canopy structure which is related to canopy cover. In contrast the bistatic scattering coefficient had no significant contribution to class separability. The classification with coherence and textural information outperformed the classification with the monostatic scattering coefficient and texture by more than 10% and achieved an overall accuracy of 85%. These results indicate that TanDEM-X can serve as a valuable and consistent source for mapping and monitoring tropical forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - The existence of peatlands plays a very important role both locally, regionally, and globally. Besides having an ecological function to maintain biodiversity and environmental balance, it also has its economic and socio-cultural functions. Furthermore, it has provided enormous benefits for life and has had positive social and economic impacts. Peat ecosystems have been damaged due to the mismanagement of land. Areas that play specific roles in its sustainability have been converted to lands for business activities, which contradicts their characteristic function. Land cover restoration policies will be useful for improving the quality of participatory-based land cover, protecting peat domes, and conserving watersheds (DAS). An increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which occurs due to insufficient peatland management is a serious threat to local communities and their livelihoods. Furthermore, the ecosystem can be conserved by ensuring that water is properly managed, drainage to cultivated areas is limited and peat swamp forest systems are protected. The application of eco-hydro technology can be beneficial to biodiversity as it minimizes degradation, reduces carbon emissions, and prevents fires.

TI  - Can conservation funding be left to carbon finance? Evidence from participatory future land use scenarios in Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Revenues derived from carbon have been seen as an important tool for supporting forest conservation over the past decade. At the same time, there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this uncertainty, REDD+ projects and conservation initiatives that aim to take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of future revenue from carbon finance. The future scenarios-based approach is useful to policy-makers and conservation program developers in distinguishing between landscapes where carbon finance can substantially support conservation, and landscapes where other strategies for conservation and land use should be prioritized.

TI  - Geographic Setting and Groundwater Table Control Carbon Emission from Indonesian Peatland: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia's emission reduction target by 2030.

TI  - Facilitating new livelihoods to promote peatland restoration in Indonesia - what are the challenges for ensuring sustainable and equitable livelihood transitions?
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the peatland in Central Kalimantan is highly degraded because it has been cleared and drained over the last 30-40 years. Degraded peatland is highly susceptible to burning and oxidation and contributes 30-60 % of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of Indonesia. To combat these problems, the Government of Indonesia has made peatland restoration a high priority, with revitalisation of livelihoods being a critical component to help communities transition to rewet peat. We sought to understand this social transition in Tumbang Nusa, one of the villages that has had a high level of intervention through the recent peatland restoration efforts. Over the last five years, several new livelihood initiatives have been deployed in Tumbang Nusa including seven capacity building programs, five government assistance programs and 18 demonstration plots, but many of these initiatives have been unsuccessful, with only a handful of farmers having adopted the outcomes. In effect, the peatland has not been rewet and the community has largely not transitioned to a more sustainable set of livelihoods. To make peatland restoration work it is critical to overcome several barriers so that communities can embrace the restoration process and can drive it autonomously, rather than needing outside input and assistance to maintain momentum. There is also a clear need for a functioning carbon market, such that peatland communities benefit from peat rewetting. Only once the community directly benefits from restoration will it actively participate in ensuring its success.

TI  - REDD plus in Indonesia: An assessment of the international environmental program
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and assesses the progress on the effects of Indonesia's REDD+ program. Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project's implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups' interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods.

TI  - Climate change mitigation strategies in agriculture and land use in Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantitatively evaluated mitigation potentials of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use sectors in Indonesia. We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country.

TI  - Does REDD plus Complement Law Enforcement? Evaluating Impacts of an Incipient Initiative in Madre de Dios, Peru
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subnational initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance carbon stocks (REDD+) have been implemented across the tropics over the last decade. Such initiatives are often embedded within pre-existing conservation policies, such as forest law enforcement, making it challenging to disentangle attributable impacts. In this article, we analyze a new REDD+ project implemented in Brazil nut concessions in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Public law enforcement to verify compliance with Peru's Forest Law was already ongoing and intensified locally during our study period. Thus, we combine longitudinal data from remote sensing and household surveys of 197 concessionaires in a before-after control-intervention (BACI) study design to: a) evaluate the project's impacts during the 2012-2018 period on deforestation, forest degradation, and the participants' wellbeing and b) assess how the law-enforcing field inspections may have complemented the project effects. Our results show that the REDD+ initiative had insignificant effects on deforestation and forest degradation, but confirm the curbing effects of the field inspection measures on forest loss. The non-significance of the REDD+ effects may reflect delays in cash incentive payments to enrolled concessionaires, lack of careful alignment of benefit provision with project participants, and limited enforcement of project conditionalities. Most REDD+ participants reported a reduced subjective wellbeing, which may reflect the frustrated expectations associated with project implementation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline lessons for similar tropical forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Selective Logging on the Forest Understory in the Amazon Using Airborne LiDAR
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management (SFM) areas. However, monitoring the forest understory-a critical area for assessing logging impacts-remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rond & ocirc;nia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts.

TI  - A reality check on the landscape approach to REDD plus : Lessons from Latin America
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing and institutionalizing cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable land use remains a crucial, yet politically contested, objective in global sustainability governance. There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of "reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation" (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, "landscape" approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of "niche" sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions.

TI  - Economic analysis of the implementation of forestry projects for carbon credits generation for farmers in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the economic viability of the implementation of projects for carbon credits generation in natural forests and planted forest with native species for farmers in the Atlantic Forest. For this analysis the following scenarios were used: Afforestation/reforestation with native species and early sale of carbon credits - FRVA; Afforestation/reforestation with native species and sale of carbon credits along the years - FRVL; Secondary forest (capoeira) with early sale of carbon credits - CVA; and Primary forest with early sale of carbon credits - FPVA. The economic analysis was performed for a 30-year horizon plan and the economic criteria included net present value, equivalent annual value and benefit/cost ratio. The price of a ton of CO2(eq) was an average for the year 2009, that is US$ 10.24 (Kyoto market) or US$ 3.03 (voluntary market). The economic analysis showed that only the scenario FRVA was economically viable. The results allow concluding that the economic viability of such projects is associated to the carbon stock present in the forest, to the year of carbon credits sale and to their selling prices. Presented results can help in decision making and assisting in the design of projects that seek approval in the CDM or in voluntary markets.

TI  - Roadside vegetation: estimation and potential for carbon sequestration
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper reports the assessment of the vegetation occupancy rate of the roadside, through analysis of aerial photographs. Using such value the potential of these areas to be employed as carbon (C) sinks was also assessed. Moreover, for the areas suitable for afforestation, the potential for carbon sequestration was estimated considering different species of vegetation, both native (scenario 1) and exotic (formed by Pinus sp. and Eucalyptus sp. - scenario 2). The study was carried out through GIS techniques and two regions were considered. A set of equations was used to estimate the rate of occupancy over the study areas, as well as amounts of fixed C under the above scenarios. The average occupancy rate was 0.06%. The simulation showed a higher potential for C sequestration in scenario 2, being the estimated amounts of CO(2) sequestered from the atmosphere per km of roadside: 131 tons of CO(2) km(-1) of highway to native species and 655 tons of CO(2) km(-1) of highway for exotic species (over period of 10 years for both estimates). If we consider the whole road network of the Sao Paulo State (approximately 190 000 km) and that a considerable part of this road work is suitable to receive this kind of service, it is possible to predict the very high potential for C sequestration if managers and planners consider roadside as area for afforestation.

TI  - Non-conformities to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards: Empirical evidence and implications for policy-making in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are becoming increasingly important in sustainable forest governance. In 2016, FSC certified a total forest area of 195 Mha across 80 countries. While there is considerable room for expanding FSC's reach, there has been a lack of incentives for producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries. Information about existing barriers and challenges to comply with FSC standards are fundamental to promote such incentives. The objective of this study was to explore the main challenges faced by firms in the FSC certification process and discuss their policy implications. This was carried out by analyzing the quantity, spatial distribution, non-compliant principles, potential triggers and thematic areas of non-conformities (NCs) to FSC certification disclosed in the Public Summary Reports of third-party audits in Brazil. More specifically it tried to understand the specific issues to which the NCs were potentially associated to. This study generated descriptive and inferential statistics of a sample of 1086 NCs to FSC standards disclosed in the 110 Public Summary Reports, from which the overall majority were related to the certification of plantation forests that had gone through maintenance audits. The occurrence of NCs was found to be most frequently associated with FSC Principles 4 (26,07%), 6 (21,82%) and 8 (13,72%), which are related to the themes "Community Relations and Worker's rights", "Environmental Impact" and "Monitoring and Assessment", respectively. Many NCs were triggered by aspects of forest planning, operation and monitoring, which altogether accounted for 42.91% of all NCs. Problems related to occupational health and safety were also a relevant theme, accounting for almost 20% of the total non-conformities. Findings from the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that auditors tended to identify similar NCs, regardless of the geographical region, of the type of forest and of the type of audit (certification or maintenance). Spearman Correlation tests indicated significant relationships between certified forest area and non-conformities with FSC Principles 4 and 7 (Community Relations and Worker's Rights, and Management Plans, respectively). The meaning of this relationship is unclear. Overall, findings corroborate previous studies that found FSC Principles 4 and 6 among the most challenging of the global FSC system. There seems to exist an opportunity for the development of stronger technical guidance and capacity building policies related to community relations, worker's rights, and environmental impacts. If such issues are already challenging in the context of large forest plantations, Brazilian policy-makers should expect small-scale firms to face even higher levels of difficulty, given their lack of financial and human resources. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and suggesting future research avenues.

TI  - Restoration of land productivity and environment through reforestation of Imperata cylindrica grasslands
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forestry on the widespread Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv. secondary grasslands in Indonesia is technically feasible and financially profitable, provided that fast early growth and high yield per hectare are achieved. Fast early growth and canopy closure ensure rapid suppression of the grass, thereby reducing competition and fire susceptibility. Considerable differences in growth between species and among provenances indicate the need for careful species and provenance selection and species/site matching. Production of high-quality seedlings is a prerequisite for survival over the critical early phase when competition by grass is fierce. Total cultivation is better than strip cultivation, and a stand density of at least 1100 seedlings/ha is required. Plantation establishment costs have an insignificant effect on the financial profitability of the scheme, but a high yield per hectare has a highly significant effect. Plantation establishment has considerable environmental effects which make it profitable from a wider economical perspective. These include sequestration of atmospheric carbon and maintenance of biological diversity.

AB  - The government has granted Social Forestry (SF) management licenses since 2014, in the Village Forest and Community Forestry scheme, for communities around the forest in the highlands of South Sumatra. However, until early 2019, most of the SF groups still did not have a concept or vision of what was to be designed. The work area of SF is generally a stretch of monoculture coffee plantations. Within the frame of a sustainable forest management system, they are confused about making plans and actions. We conducted action research at two Village Forest groups in Muara Enim, South Sumatra, to encourage the implementation of independent SF. We use Vayda's progressive contextualization research approach. We found the desire of farmers to make Kebun-Ghepang in the SF work area, not just tree planting activities, as requested by the forester. Ghepang is a term of the Besemah ethnic people for fruit gardens that resemble forests, generally dominated by durian trees. Ghepang is a legacy of ancestors. Kebun-ghepang is an imagined forest by both the local community and foresters. The formation and conception of Kebun Ghepang would be an ecological and institutional reference in managing and building SF work areas, as analyzed in this paper.

M3  - Article
AB  - The decade 2021-2030 was defined by the UN as the decade of 'Ecosystem Restoration' and of 'Ocean Science for Sustainable Development', aiming to restore ecosystems and protect the Oceans. Among target ecosystems, mangroves are fundamental wetlands, since they support a lively, biologically dynamic frontier between land and sea, furnishing many goods and services in relation to their extension, like fisheries, timber, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, among others. Regarding climate change, mangrove restoration helps mitigate GHG emissions, by sequestering carbon in biomass and sediments for long periods of time and increases shore protection facing sea level rise and extreme climate events. The possibilities and conditions for mangrove restoration are many, and their rehabilitation/restoration is possible as provided by evidence form many experiments worldwide. Notwithstanding, there are still many steps in methodology and governance decisions to place mangrove restoration as a globally effective mitigation and adaptation measure to climate change.

TI  - Carbon storage and CO2 dynamics from wood products harvested in Brazil during 1900-2016
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - How relevant is the role of CO2 from harvested wood products (HWPs) for the Brazilian GHG emission balance? The C stocks and CO2 emissions and removals from the HWPs in Brazil during 1900-2016 were evaluated using three methodological approaches: stock-change approach (SCA), production approach (PA), and stock-change of domestic origin (SCDOA). Data from the FAO's FAOSTAT system on production, import and export of semi-finished products (sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper/paperboard) were analyzed, considering distinct land-use activities: deforestation (D), forest management (FM) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R). Two scenarios to evaluate the effect of HWPs from D were evaluated. The C stock in HWPs in 2016 reached 252 Mt C, by SCA. Contributions to C storage historically were higher from sawnwood, but wood-based panels and paper/paperboard have recently outperformed it. A/R is the major activity responsible for C storage in HWPs. The CO2 removal by HWPs was 521 Mt during 1990-2016, which corresponds to 1.1% of the country's emissions in the same period. It was concluded that Brazil has become a major producer and wood consumer and that HWPs are allies for a positive C balance and fulfillment of the commitments assumed by the country regarding climate change.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF INDIGENOUS SAGO-BASED AGRICULTURE ON LOCAL FOREST LANDSCAPES IN MALUKU, EAST INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the influence of sago-based vegeculture (cultivation of sago and vegetatively propagated crops) in Seram, Maluku province, east Indonesia, on the local forest landscape. The land productivity of sago groves, dependence of local people on sago and size of shifting cultivation field were analysed. Field research was conducted intermittently between 2003 and 2010 in an upland community in Seram. The study found that (1) the land productivity of sago groves in the village was higher than that of upland rice fields throughout South-East Asia, (2) sago was the most important staple food in terms of energy intake and was highly valued by the local people and (3) shifting cultivation fields were very small compared with upland rice fields throughout South and South-East Asia. This type of small-scale shifting cultivation creates relatively little pressure for forest clearance, suggesting that sago-based vegeculture contributes, to some extent, to supporting the rich natural forest-dominated rural landscape in Seram.

TI  - Changes in soil quality indicators under oil palm plantations following application of 'best management practices' in a four-year field trial
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing the yield of existing oil palm plantations is one means of accommodating some of the growing demand for palm oil. The International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) has developed and tested a process to deploy a series of 'best management practices' (BMPs) that cover a range of agronomic practices intended to intensify oil palm production and improve yield at a given site using cost-effective, practical methods. Many of these BMPs include techniques that should also improve soil quality, such as the addition of organic matter to the soil surface, and improved timing and tailored application of mineral and organic fertilisers. Six plantations in Kalimantan and Sumatra applied BMPs prescribed by IPNI (BMP treatment), and standard management practices (REF treatment) in paired blocks of oil palm over four years; 30 pairs of blocks were included in the research. Soils were sampled in both treatments before and after the field trial, from beneath weeded circles surrounding individual palms and beneath frond piles in between rows of palms, at 0-20 cm depth and 20-40 cm depth. Soils were tested for a range of properties, including soil pH, % soil organic carbon (% SOC), total N, available P, and exchangeable cations. No clear, consistent differences were found in the degree of change in soil properties between BMP and REF treatments over four years. However, improvements in some soil properties were noted for both treatments, particularly for soil pH and % SOC. There was no significant deterioration in the measured soil properties over the four years. The results suggest that appropriate management practices for oil palm can improve several aspects of soil quality. Further research on the mechanisms by which BMPs can improve soil quality, and monitoring over longer periods of time is recommended to give plantation managers a clearer picture of the potential 'co-benefits' that can be obtained with adoption of BMPs designed to increase oil palm yield.

TI  - Forest Policy Innovation at the Subnational Scale: Insights from Acre, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - REDD+ is often characterised as a 'global' environmental framework implemented in tropical forests around the world. Yet studying actual cases of REDD+ can reveal complex interactions between scales, including under-recognised innovations at subnational and local scales. To understand these dynamics, this article brings together academics and policymakers to analyse the System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA)-a pioneering subnational policy in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil that includes a prominent jurisdictional REDD+ programme. While institutions, people, and ideas from outside of Acre contributed to its formulation, SISA is not a standardised local expression of a global policy. Rather, key aspects of it originated in ongoing and historical Acrean forest-use and governance. This analysis shows how innovative, place-based conservation policy can be influential, both within and beyond specific localities, in ways that challenge analyses of REDD+ that are primarily top-down. Our study of SISA also shows how topics of importance in contemporary REDD+ and forest conservation scholarship-efforts to make the living forest valuable, non-carbon social and environmental "co-benefits," and landscape- and jurisdiction-wide approaches to combating deforestation-are connected to Acrean forest governance and history. Overall, this analysis elucidates the strengths and challenges of subnational forest governance and the complex inter-scalar dynamics in REDD+ and other conservation and climate policies.

TI  - Information exchange in swidden communities of West Kalimantan: lessons for designing REDD
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested areas of Kalimantan, Indonesia, are often inhabited by swiddeners, and are also targeted by a range of interventions related to development and forest conservation, including REDD+. Whether these interventions are adopted, adapted or rejected by the local people is linked to the varying degrees of access to information that different types of households have, which also leads to unequal sharing of the associated benefits. This paper analyses factors influencing household access to agriculture and forestry-related information using quantitative and qualitative methods in three communities in West-Kalimantan, and draws lessons for designing REDD+. Household socio-economic characteristics (origin, status, migration patterns) and the divide between sub-groups in the communities (caused by origin, opinions, residential location, and relationships) were found to influence household access to information. Suggestions for improved REDD+ information exchange include: having more targeted and incentivised REDD+ activities; encouraging more equitable information sharing; and taking better account of local realities while designing REDD+.

TI  - New perspectives in fire management in South American savannas: The importance of intercultural governance
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires continue to cause damage to property, livelihoods and environments around the world. Acknowledging that dealing with wildfires has to go beyond fire-fighting, governments in countries with fire-prone ecosystems have begun to recognize the multiple perspectives of landscape burning and the need to engage with local communities and their practices. In this perspective, we outline the experiences of Brazil and Venezuela, two countries where fire management has been highly contested, but where there have been recent advances in fire management approaches. Success of these new initiatives have been measured by the reduction in wildfire extent through prescribed burning, and the opening of a dialogue on fire management between government agencies and local communities. Yet, it is clear that further developments in community participation need to take place in order to avoid the appropriation of local knowledge systems by institutions, and to better reflect more equitable fire governance.

TI  - Economic benefits of forest conservation: assessing the potential rents from Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios, Peru, to channel REDD+ investments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil nut collection is key to reconciling sustainable economic development with forest conservation in the Amazon. Whether the activity is profitable, however, remains uncertain due to the paucity of information on spatial distribution and productivity of trees as well as the costs of collection and processing. To fill this gap, this study developed and used a spatially-explicit rent model of Brazil nut production to assess yields and potential profits (rents) from the Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios (Peru), under three scenarios of processing and management (unshelled, shelled and shelled-certified nuts). Potential annual production in the region was estimated to be 14.1 +/- 2.4 thousand tonnes of unshelled nuts; at 2008 regional sale prices this corresponded to profits of between US$ 3.1 +/- 0.5 ha(-1) yr(-1) for unshelled nuts to US$ 8.4 +/- 1.4 ha(-1) yr(-1) for shelled-certified nuts. Investment of c. US$ 14-17 ha(-1) is required to develop certified production in Madre de Dios concessions; this would approximately triple rents in these areas. Such investment could be channelled through REDD+ projects; sustainable management of Brazil nut concessions may contribute to a 42-43% reduction in deforestation in Madre de Dios by 2050.

TI  - Intensity Analysis to Study the Dynamics of Reforestation in the Rio Doce Water Basin, Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservationists routinely require methods to analyze the effects of conservation interventions such as reforestation. Although methods to measure the effects of reforestation abound, these methods often fail to track and communicate the complexities of reforestation interventions. This paper uses intensity analysis to analyze the effects of reforestation intervention in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. In particular, this paper uses intensity analysis to study the effects of reforestation on three land cover categories in Brazil's Rio Doce water basin. The illustrative approach analyzes the temporal difference of forest in three land cover maps at time points 1998, 2008, and 2015 from the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, where each map has four land cover categories: forest formation, pasture, mosaic of agriculture and pasture, and urban infrastructure. Interval level intensity indicates that change is faster during the second time interval (1998-2008). The results from the categorical level intensity show that the forest formation and the mosaic of agriculture and pasture are active gainers during both time intervals, while pasture is an active loser. Forest formation targets the mosaic of agriculture and pasture more intensively at the interval level during the first time interval. Forest formation gains the most from a mosaic of agriculture and pasture while at the same time targeting the mosaic of agriculture and pasture during the second time interval. The mosaic of agriculture and pasture gains the most from both forest formation and pasture during both time intervals but targets pasture. The results for the second time interval show that the reforestation process in the Rio Doce water basin, Brazil, only forced the farmers to move to other forest covers in the vicinity. This process constitutes exchange, which accounts for more than half of the change during the second time interval, and thus contributes 0 to the net change of forest.

TI  - A Chronicle of Indonesia's Forest Management: A Long Step towards Environmental Sustainability and Community Welfare
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, with 17,000 islands of varying sizes and elevations, from lowlands to very high mountains, stretching more than 5000 km eastward from Sabang in Aceh to Merauke in Papua. Although occupying only 1.3% of the world's land area, Indonesia possesses the third-largest rainforest and the second-highest level of biodiversity, with very high species diversity and endemism. However, during the last two decades, Indonesia has been known as a country with a high level of deforestation, a producer of smoke from burning forests and land, and a producer of carbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to review the environmental history and the long process of Indonesian forest management towards achieving environmental sustainability and community welfare. To do this, we analyze the milestones of Indonesian forest management history, present and future challenges, and provide strategic recommendations toward a viable Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) system. Our review showed that the history of forestry management in Indonesia has evolved through a long process, especially related to contestation over the control of natural resources and supporting policies and regulations. During the process, many efforts have been applied to reduce the deforestation rate, such as a moratorium on permitting primary natural forest and peat land, land rehabilitation and soil conservation, environmental protection, and other significant regulations. Therefore, these efforts should be maintained and improved continuously in the future due to their significant positive impacts on a variety of forest areas toward the achievement of viable SFM. Finally, we conclude that the Indonesian government has struggled to formulate sustainable forest management policies that balance economic, ecological, and social needs, among others, through developing and implementing social forestry instruments, developing and implementing human resource capacity, increasing community literacy, strengthening forest governance by eliminating ambiguity and overlapping regulations, simplification of bureaucracy, revitalization of traditional wisdom, and fair law enforcement.

TI  - Distributed land use modeling and sensitivity analysis for REDD
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent need to develop a framework for understanding and predicting the effect of opportunity costs of REDD+. We develop an approach comprising two components: distributed land use modeling for assessing the profitability gap between maintaining palm oil plantations and complying with REDD+ and a sensitivity analysis of the model's predictions. First, a spatially explicit model is used to predict the future distribution of land use changes in central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This model predicts the change in carbon storage due to deforestation by linking business-as-usual baseline emissions scenario to historic data and using an improved cellular automaton system to predict land use changes. Input parameters include elevation, slope, aspect, soil types, distance to road, distance to river, etc. The so-called "ton-year approach" is combined with the future price of carbon to estimate compensation under the REDD+ mechanism. Potential revenues from palm oil plantation are calculated by multiplying yields from palm oil products with corresponding prices in the world market. Second, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the robustness of the modeling results to alternative assumptions about palm oil price and carbon price. The palm oil price is shown to have the highest relative sensitivity. Further analysis indicates remarkable changes in the profitability gap depending on the price of palm oil; a change in palm oil price from $545.33 to $773.03 shows a large 155% increase in the profitability gap. Unfortunately, the most likely forecasts of palm oil prices continue to predict large differences in the profitability gap, favoring palm oil plantation over REDD+ projects. Thus, the effect of carbon pricing policies, as they currently stand, will remain limited. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A scoping review of the health co-benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South America
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
M3  - Review
AB  - The accelerated production of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to human activity has led to unprecedented global warming, making climate mitigation strategies crucial for minimizing its impacts. South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

TI  - Assessing the carbon capture potential of a reforestation project
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of reforestation projects worldwide is increasing. In many cases funding is obtained through the claimed carbon capture of the trees, presented as immediate and durable, whereas reforested plots need time and maintenance to realise their carbon capture potential. Further, claims usually overlook the environmental costs of natural or anthropogenic disturbances during the forest's lifetime, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the reforestation are not allowed for. This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify the carbon footprint of setting up a reforestation plot in the Peruvian Amazon. In parallel, we combine a soil carbon model with an above- and below-ground plant carbon model to predict the increase in carbon stocks after planting. We compare our results with the carbon capture claims made by a reforestation platform. Our results show major errors in carbon accounting in reforestation projects if they (1) ignore the time needed for trees to reach their carbon capture potential; (2) ignore the GHG emissions involved in setting up a plot; (3) report the carbon capture potential per tree planted, thereby ignoring limitations at the forest ecosystem level; or (4) under-estimate tree losses due to inevitable human and climatic disturbances. Further, we show that applications of biochar during reforestation can partially compensate for project emissions.

TI  - Synergy potential between climate change mitigation and forest conservation policies in the Indonesian forest sector: implications for achieving multiple sustainable development objectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs.

TI  - A large-scale field assessment of carbon stocks in human-modified tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation.

TI  - Facilitating agroforestation of landscapes for sustainable benefits: Tradeoffs between carbon stocks and local development benefits in Indonesia according to the FALLOW model
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far materialized. The main challenges to implementation,of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in ( I) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM, However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization, We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km(-2)) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results Support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Degradation and conservation of Brazilian mangroves, status and perspectives
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most human-affected coastal ecosystems, despite their important social and ecological roles, and after decades of devastation these forests continue facing different processes of conversion, threatening their global future. Brazilian mangroves are not an exception, despite the existence of severe protection legislation. Conversions to aquaculture, industrial and urban development among others, have destroyed more than 50,000 ha (about 4% of the total mangrove area in the country) over the past three decades. Restoration efforts have somewhat minimized losses, but has recuperated only a 5% of the total degraded area. Despite criticized, monospecific plantings have demonstrated return of some ecosystem structure and functioning, and seems to be a starting point in mangrove restoration. Around 70% of Brazilian mangroves are today inside preserved areas, but the effectiveness of these advances continues impaired by bureaucracy, lack of conservation policies and economic interests. We estimate the status of Brazilian mangroves and review some restoration and conservation efforts, suggesting some management measures like restoration and community-based ecosystem management. Based in a reforested stand in Northeastern Brazil, we assess the environmental cost of mangrove clearing and reforestation results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Promising native tree species for reforestation of degraded tropical peatlands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests (PSF) of South East Asia are biodiversity hotspots and carbon-rich ecosystems under severe degradation and threat of extinction. Almost yearly recurring fires progressively devastate clear-cut PSFs. The need for both conservation and active restoration together with the appropriate information on the techniques and species is urgent. The aim of this study was to find native PSF species that are suitable for reforestation in the open degraded peatlands. We established two planting experiments in degraded peat areas with 21 tree species to study the survival and growth in relation to environmental factors for 2 years. The study sites were located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in the degraded peatland of the Ex-Mega Rice area and along the degraded margins of the river Sabangau. Seed material collected from local forests was grown in a field nursery and planted 6-11 months later in the field. Growth and mortality of the seedlings and environmental variables (water table, temperature) were monitored frequently for two years. The effects of the environmental variables on growth were tested with mixed-effects models and on mortality with Cox regression. As a result, we could derive species-specific information of the seedlings' early stage ecology and suitability for restoration. The most promising species based on the analysis were Shorea balangeran, Adenanthera pavonina, Dacryodes rostrata and Lithocarpus dasystachys. The comparison of the two differing areas revealed contrasting challenges: the main obstacle for reforestation in the Ex-Mega Rice area was fire, whereas in the river margin extreme water table fluctuation limited the success of the seedlings.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forests serve as a dwelling place and source of livelihood for the people of Indonesia. This paper analyzed the forest resources and forestry in Indonesia. The forest area in Indonesia amounts to 137,090,468.18 ha consisting of 133,694,685.18 ha as terrestrial forest area and 3,395,783 ha as water area. Hard work by the Ministry of Forestry has succeeded in suppressing the average rate of forest degradation. For the purpose of enlarging the log production from natural production forest through the silvicultural system of TPTI (Indonesian Planting and Selection Cutting), an Intensive Silvicultural System has been introduced at 25 forest concessions with the total area of about 52,300 ha. On the other hand, owing to its geographical position in the Equator region between the Asian and Australian continents, Indonesian tropical forest possesses high biodiversity. Finally, to guarantee the local community's active participation in the sustainable forest management practice, the government has empowered the local communities that live within and surrounding the forest area through various programs, such as establishing community forest, village forest, conservation forest, production center of non-wood forest products, community-based forest management and an improvement program with forest concession companies. The government also introduced the General Service Agency for financial support for communities that want to establish a forest plantation.

TI  - Forest law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon: Costs and income effects
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-A-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible.

Mangrove reforestation as a mesotidial coastal protection and clean develepment mechanism on Macau-Serra oil field, Potiguar Basin, Northeast Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1268 - 1271. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km(2) appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarao Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.

TI  - Mapping deep peat carbon stock from a LiDAR based DTM and field measurements, with application to eastern Sumatra
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R-2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application.

TI  - Land-Based Mitigation Strategies under the Mid-Term Carbon Reduction Targets in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the key mitigation options for achieving the mid-term target for carbon emission reduction in Indonesia. A computable general equilibrium model coupled with a land-based mitigation technology model was used to evaluate specific mitigation options within the whole economic framework. The results revealed three primary findings: (1) If no climate policy were implemented, Indonesia's total greenhouse gas emissions would reach 3.0 GtCO(2)eq by 2030; (2) To reduce carbon emissions to meet the latest Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDC) target, similar to 58% of total reductions should come from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors by implementing forest protection, afforestation and plantation efforts; (3) A higher carbon price in 2020 suggests that meeting the 2020 target would be economically challenging, whereas the INDC target for 2030 would be more economically realistic in Indonesia.

TI  - Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 MgCha(-1)year(-1) in 6-year-old system to 13.5 MgCha(-1)year(-1) in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.

TI  - Biomass and carbon balance in a dry tropical forest area in northeast Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas.

TI  - Growth and yield modelling of Acacia mangium in Colombia
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the growth and yield of Acacia mangium in the Caribbean region of Colombia, allometric equations of total volume and aboveground plus coarse roots biomass were fitted as a function of the tree's diameter at breast height (dbh). The von Bertalanffy's growth model and 59, 0.1 ha plots (0.55-9.55 years old) were used to develop site index (SI) curves at 6 years base age. Then, using the state-space approach, stand growth and yield models were developed for basal area, volume and biomass. The results show that A. mangium is a very promising species for timber production, atmospheric carbon removal and soil restoration because it grows very fast even in mining degraded soils. On average sites it reaches 15 m in height in 3 years. However, early and reiterated thinning coupled with initial mortality by cattle invasion of the very young understocked plantations are producing relatively low yields.

TI  - Regulating the Sustainability of Forest Management in the Americas: Cross-Country Comparisons of Forest Legislation
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on theoretical underpinnings and an empirical review of forest laws and regulations of selected countries throughout the Americas, we examine key components of natural forest management and how they are addressed in the legal frameworks of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the U.S. We consider forest policy directives in terms of legislative, planning, operational, environmental/ecological, social, and economic aspects and classify them by the type of policy obligation: (1) non-discretionary laws or rules; or (2) discretionary, voluntary directives; and, further, by the type of policy approach: (1) a specific technology or practice required or recommended; (2) a process or system requirement or recommendation; or (3) a performance or outcome based requirement or recommendation. Protection of at-risk species and riparian buffers are required in all countries and include specific prescriptions in most; forest management planning and secure, legal land title or tenancy are commonly required; and mandatory processes to protect soil and water quality are customary. Less common requirements include forest monitoring and social and economic aspects, and, when in place, they are usually voluntary. Implications for improved policies to achieve sustainable forest management (SFM) are discussed.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration and Environmental Service Assessment in the Special Purpose Forest Area of Mount Bromo, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the carbon and environmental service potential in the natural tourism zone of special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo. The study focused on understanding how this area, with its specific tree compositions and sizes, contributes to carbon absorption and environmental benefits, which can also translate into carbon credits, a form of state revenue. The methodology involved purposive sampling to create observational sample plots (OSP) of varying sizes based on tree diameter. These plots were designed to measure the biomass, carbon potential, and environmental service potential of the trees in a given area. The collected data included the composition of tree species, the number of each type of tree, their diameters, and heights. The study applied specific formulas to determine the potential of biomass, carbon, and environmental services in the area. Key findings revealed a dominance of mahogany trees (83 trees per hectare) among ten identified plant species, indicating a specific but lower biodiversity in this zone. The significant results of the study include the quantification of biomass potential, which was found to be 787.84 tons/ha above -ground and 228.47 tons/ha below -ground, totaling 1016.31 tons/hectare. The study also evaluated the environmental service potential, including CO2 absorption and O2 production. The CO2 absorption capacity of the area was estimated at 1753.04 tons/ha, with a corresponding high O2 production of 1279.72 tons/ha. Additionally, the potential for carbon credits in the area was calculated at approximately 70.12 US$/ha. This research is crucial in understanding how specific forest areas, like special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo, can play a significant role in global environmental sustainability efforts.

TI  - Sustainable aviation fuels must control induced land use change: an integrated assessment modelling exercise for Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bio-sustainable aviation fuels (bio-SAFs) are an important pillar of the aviation sector decarbonisation strategy in the mid-term. Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of -286.8 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO(2)e.MJ(-1) for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions.

TI  - Legitimacy in REDD plus governance in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the question of legitimacy in REDD+ governance in Indonesia. It develops a legitimacy framework that builds on elements of Scharpf (J Eur Pub Policy 4(1):18-36, 1997) input and output legitimacy concept and the political economy lens described by Brockhaus and Angelsen (Analysing REDD+: Challenges and choices, CIFOR, Bogor, 2012). Using data collected through key informant interviews and focus groups, we identify and explore stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy. The analysis reveals a complex interplay between input and output legitimacy, finding that state, non-state and hybrid actors perceive output legitimacy (i.e. project outcomes) as highly dependent on the level of input legitimacy achieved during the governance process. Non-state actors perceive proxies for input legitimacy, such as participation and inclusion of local people, as goals in themselves. In the main, they perceive inclusion to be integral to the empowerment of local people. They perceive output legitimacy as less important because of the intangibility of REDD+ outcomes at this stage in the process. The findings also highlight the challenges associated with measuring the legitimacy of REDD+ governance in Indonesia.

TI  - COST ESTIMATES FOR MITIGATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS OF TRANSPORTATION OF PARAIBA THROUGH REFORESTATION
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific evidences indicate that the atmospheric CO(2)concentrations are approximately 16% above of the levels entered in 1990. Ambient questions associates to the emissions of the pollutants proceeding from fossil fuels present global problems, such as, toxicity of air and the gases of effect greenhouse (GHG). To lessen its effects were created mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon markets. The carbon sequestration with plantation of forests promotes the absorption of great amounts of carbonic gas (CO2) presents in the atmosphere. This natural process helps considerably to diminish the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and each hectare of forest in development is capable to absorb of 150 the 200 tons of carbon. Scientific research has proven that great part of the global heating is of anthropogenic origin and; therefore, the proper action human being can and must intervene in the direction to reduce the emissions and to mitigate the emissions not prevented. The present work has for objectives to esteem the areas of necessary reforestations for the effective mitigation of the carbonic gas emissions (CO2) of the sector of road transport of the Paraiba State, Brazil, as well as to evaluate the costs for ton of CO2 sequestered in function of the forest essences and the costs to reforest one hectare. The best ones resulted had been gotten with commercial hybrid Eucalyptus urograndis, the results for the average of the experimental hybrids in the Chapada do Araripe, Pernambuco State, Brazil had been a little inferior, but both had been very superior to the gotten ones with Mimosa tenuiflora planted in the Chapada do Apodi, Ceara State. Such commentaries if apply for the estimates of areas and costs for ton of CO2 sequestered (mitigated).

TI  - Who Should Benefit from REDD plus ? Rationales and Realities
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Benefit-sharing mechanisms are a central design aspect of REDD+ because they help to create the necessary incentives to reduce carbon emissions. However, if stakeholders do not perceive the benefit sharing as fair, the legitimacy of REDD+, and support for the mechanism, will be weakened. In this paper, drawing on data from CIFOR's Global Comparative Study on REDD+, we analyze national policy processes in 6 countries and incipient benefit-sharing arrangements in 21 REDD+ project sites. Through our analysis of current practices and debates, we identify six rationales that have been put forward to justify how benefits should be distributed and to whom. These rationales encompass a range of perspectives. Some hold that benefit sharing should be related to actual carbon emission reductions or to costs incurred in achieving the reduction of emissions; others emphasize the importance of a legal right to benefit, the need to consider aspects such as poverty reduction or the appropriateness of rewarding those with a history of protecting the forest. Each rationale has implications for the design of benefit-sharing mechanisms and the equity of their outcomes. We point out that, given the wide range of rationales and interests at play, the objectives of REDD+ and benefit sharing must be clearly established and the term "benefit" defined before effective benefit-sharing mechanisms can be designed. For stakeholders to support REDD+, the legitimacy of decision-making institutions, consideration of context, and attention to process are critical. Building legitimacy requires attention not only to fair distributional outcomes but also to consensus on relevant institutions' authority to make decisions and to procedural equity.

TI  - BIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF CARBON FOREST SEQUESTRATION AND OF THE ECOLOGICAL DEBT: AN APPLICATION TO THE CASE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Though heavily criticized, the Kyoto Protocol has stood out as the key political tool in addressing climate change. However, one of the few instruments that allows industrialized and developing countries to cooperate towards mitigation of GHGs is CDM (Clean Development Mechanism). The underlying assumption of forestry CDM is that forest plantations (afforestation/ reforestation) might help remove carbon dioxide (the most representative GHG) emissions and compensate for the loss of natural forests. Therefore, this study focuses on this alleged trade-off. A bioeconomic analysis, which abstracts out money variables, is applied to assess carbon forest sequestration in Rio Grande do Sul. The state's forest area is split up into natural and planted forests only. On one hand, this does not allow to check out for deforestation; on the other hand, such a phenomenon is not remarkable in Rio Grande do Sul. The land use is taken into account by a function that works as the emission removal demand. On the other hand, the emission supply function depends on the economic growth rates. The results show that, eventually, the sustainability of economic growth hinges on a region's or country's ecological situation - namely, equilibrium, credit or debt. The economic and environmental advantages of each mitigation strategy - CDM and natural forest conservation - are crosschecked. A nearly 40-year-long overshoot rate is, after all, estimated for the forest sector in Rio Grande do Sul. The estimates suggest that CDM might help to relieve environmental stress only where ecological credit is reported. Where ecological debt is already on, CDM was found unable to compensate for conservation disregard.

TI  - Net-zero emission targets for major emitting countries consistent with the Paris Agreement
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 100 countries have set or are considering net-zero emissions or neutrality targets. However, most of the information on emissions neutrality (such as timing) is provided for the global level. Here, we look at national-level neutrality-years based on globally cost-effective 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C scenarios from integrated assessment models. These results indicate that domestic net zero greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions in Brazil and the USA are reached a decade earlier than the global average, and in India and Indonesia later than global average. These results depend on choices like the accounting of land-use emissions. The results also show that carbon storage and afforestation capacity, income, share of non-CO2 emissions, and transport sector emissions affect the variance in projected phase-out years across countries. We further compare these results to an alternative approach, using equity-based rules to establish target years. These results can inform policymakers on net-zero targets. Over 100 countries have set or are considering net-zero emissions targets. Here, the authors show that a country's potential for negative emissions and methodological issues affect when countries can reach net-zero, calling for clear internationally agreed definitions and accounting methods.

TI  - Historic emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in Mato Grosso, Brazil: 1) source data uncertainties.
T2  - Carbon balance and management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.RESULTS: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year periods of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by > 20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C ha-1, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of source data uncertainties are essential for REDD+. Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions.

TI  - Influence of Carbon Sequestration in an Optimal Set of Coppice Rotations for Eucalyptus Plantations
T2  - MANAGING FOREST ECOSYSTEMS: THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, 2ND EDITION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The coppice regeneration method used to manage eucalypts leads to a simultaneous optimization problem: the manager has to simultaneously define the optimal age in each coppice rotation and the optimal number of coppice rotations for each plantation full cycle. The dynamic nature of the problem justifies the use of methods like dynamic programming in order to achieve optimal solutions. Expected land value and the duration of the optimal rotation may change significantly when payments for carbon sequestration are added as revenues in the cash flow analysis of the project. In this chapter, we analyze the effects of considering carbon sequestration as a subsidized complementary product when defining the optimal set of coppice rotations. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the inherent risk of some variables and parameters like pulpwood price, carbon price, and discount rate. The variation in the land expectation value and in the optimal rotation length is reported when these stochastic variables are computed. Two study cases are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Brazil, and another with Eucalyptus globulus Labill in Galicia, Spain.

TI  - A novel energy systems model to explore the role of land use and reforestation in achieving carbon mitigation targets: A Brazil case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its low global share of direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (1-2%), the implications of technological transitions in the agricultural and forestry sector on the energy system have been overlooked. This paper introduces the Agriculture and Land Use Sector module part of the ModUlar energy System Environment (MUSE), a novel energy system simulation model. The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways. To illustrate the model's capabilities, Brazil is used as case study. Outputs suggest that by 2030 under a 2 degrees C mitigation scenario, most of Brazil agricultural production would move from 'transitional' to 'modern' practices, improving productivity and reducing deforestation rates, at the expense of higher energy and fertiliser demand. By mid-century Brazil has the potential to liberate around 24.4 Mha of agricultural land, where large-scale reforestation could have the capacity to sequester around 5.6 GtCO(2), alleviating mitigation efforts in the energy system, especially reducing carbon capture and storage technology investments in the industry and power sector.

TI  - CHANGES IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON UNDER EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS IN BRAZIL: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper assessment of environmental quality or degradation requires knowledge of how terrestrial C pools respond to land use change. Forest plantations offer a considerable potential to sequester C in aboveground biomass. However, their impact on initial levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies from strong losses to gains, possibly affecting C balances in afforestation or reforestation initiatives. We compiled paired-plot studies on how SOC stocks under native vegetation change after planting fast-growth Eucalyptus species in Brazil, where these plantations are becoming increasingly important. SOC changes for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths varied between -25 and 42Mgha(-1), following a normal distribution centered near zero. After replacing native vegetation by Eucalyptus plantations, mean SOC changes were -15 and 03Mgha(-1) for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths, respectively. These are very low figures in comparison to C stocks usually sequestered in aboveground biomass and were statistically nonsignificant as demonstrated by a t-test at p<005. Similar low, nonsignificant SOC changes were estimated after data were stratified into first or second rotation cycles, soil texture and biome (savanna, rainforest or grassland). Although strong SOC losses or gains effectively occurred in some cases, their underpinning causes could not be generally identified in the present work and must be ascribed in a case basis, considering the full set of environmental and management conditions. We conclude that Eucalyptus spp. plantations in average have no net effect on SOC stocks in Brazil. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The biodiversity cost of carbon sequestration in tropical savanna
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas have been increasingly viewed as an opportunity for carbon sequestration through fire suppression and afforestation, but insufficient attention has been given to the consequences for biodiversity. To evaluate the biodiversity costs of increasing carbon sequestration, we quantified changes in ecosystemcarbon stocks and the associated changes in communities of plants and ants resulting from fire suppression in savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot. Fire suppression resulted in increased carbon stocks of 1.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) since 1986 but was associated with acute species loss. In sites fully encroached by forest, plant species richness declined by 27%, and ant richness declined by 35%. Richness of savanna specialists, the species most at risk of local extinction due to forest encroachment, declined by 67% for plants and 86% for ants. This loss highlights the important role of fire in maintaining biodiversity in tropical savannas, a role that is not reflected in current policies of fire suppression throughout the Brazilian Cerrado. In tropical grasslands and savannas throughout the tropics, carbon mitigation programs that promote forest cover cannot be assumed to provide net benefits for conservation.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Para State, Brazil. All trees >25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees >10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m(3) ha(-1) in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the RIL plot but only 0.5 Mg ha(-1) year in the CL plot. By 16 years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.

TI  - Rapid Response of Bird Communities to Small-Scale Reforestation in Indonesian Borneo
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha) community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by 29% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site) were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity.

TI  - Biodiversity Conservation in Southeast Asian Timber Concessions: a Critical Evaluation of Policy Mechanisms and Guidelines
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation is leading to a loss of economically productive timber concessions, as well as areas with important environmental or socio-cultural values. To counteract this threat in Southeast Asia, sustainable forest management (SFM) practices are becoming increasingly important. We assess the tools and guidelines that have been developed to promote SFM and the progress that has been made in Southeast Asia toward better logging practices. We specifically focus on practices relevant to biodiversity issues. Various regional or national mechanisms now inform governments and the timber industry about methods to reduce the impact of production forestry on wildlife and the forest environment. However, so many guidelines have been produced that it has become difficult to judge which ones are most relevant. In addition, most guidelines are phrased in general terms and lack specific recommendations targeted to local conditions. These might be reasons for the generally slow adoption of SFM practices in the region, with only a few countries having incorporated the guidelines into national legislation. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos are among the frontrunners in this process. Overall there is progress, especially in the application of certification programs, the planning and management of high conservation value forests, the regulation and control of hunting, and silvicultural management. To reduce further forest loss, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of good forest management practices. We recommend specific roles for governments, the forestry industry, and nongovernmental organizations in further promoting the implementation of SFM practices for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Promoting biodiversity enrichment in smallholder oil palm monocultures - Experimental evidence from Indonesia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the effects of two policy instruments on the adoption of native tree planting in oil palm plantations. The first instrument is an information campaign on tree planting in oil palm. The second instrument combines the information campaign with a structural intervention that provides native tree seedlings for free. We implemented a randomized controlled trial in oil-palm growing villages in Jambi, Indonesia. Our study addresses the underlying mechanisms of behavioral change, by investigating how the policy instruments shape farmers' perceptions, intentions and actual adoption decisions. The results show that information campaigns and structural interventions can motivate tree planting among smallholder oil palm farmers in Indonesia. While both treatments have a positive and significant effect, the intervention combining information with seedling provision leads to significantly higher adoption rates, indicating that overcoming structural barriers is critical. While changes in perceptions and intentions fully mediate the effect of the information campaign on adoption, they can only partially explain the effect of the combined intervention. Facilitating easy access to high-quality inputs is critical to motivate wider adoption among large numbers of potential users. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Amazon Fund 10 Years Later: Lessons from the World's Largest REDD plus Program
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Results-Based Funding (RBF) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has become an important instrument for channeling financial resources to forest conservation activities. At the same time, much literature on conservation funding is ambiguous about the effectiveness of existing RBF schemes. Many effectiveness evaluations follow a simplified version of the principal-agent model, but in practice, the relation between aid providers and funding recipients is much more complex. As a consequence, intermediary steps of conservation funding are often not accounted for in effectiveness studies. This research paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of conservation funding by analyzing the allocation of financial resources for one of the largest RBF schemes for REDD+ in the world: the Brazilian Amazon Fund. As part of this analysis, this study has built a dataset of information, with unprecedented detail, on Amazon Fund projects, in order to accurately reconstruct the allocation of financial resources across different stakeholders (i.e., governments, NGOs, research institutions), geographies, and activities. The results show that that the distribution of resources of the Amazon Fund lack a clear strategy that could maximize the results of the fund in terms of deforestation reduction. First, there are evidences that in some cases governmental organizations lack financial additionality for their projects, which renders the growing share of funding to this type of stakeholder particularly worrisome. Second, the Amazon Fund allocations did also not systematically have privileged the municipalities that showed the recent highest deforestation rates. rom the 10 municipalities with the higher deforestation rates in 2017, only 2 are amongst the top 100 receiving per/Ha considering the 775 municipalities from Legal Amazon. Third, the allocation of the financial resources from the Amazon Fund reflects the support of different projects that adopt significantly diverging theories of change, many of which are not primarily concerned with attaining further deforestation reductions. These results reflect the current approach adopted by the Amazon Fund, that do not actively seek areas for intervention, but instead wait for project submissions from proponents. As a consequence, project owners exert much influence on to the type of activities that they support how deforestation reduction is expected to be attained. The article concludes that the Amazon Fund as well as other RBF programs, should evolve over time in order to develop a more targeted funding strategy to maximize the long-term impact in reducing emissions from deforestation.

AB  - Englund et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 044002) have recently analyzed biodiesel production from oil palm plantations as one possible way to mitigate climate change while providing cost effective results. They show that data for detailed quantification of biological carbon sequestration is available allowing a high confidence evaluation of positive impacts when oil palm plantation for food and biodiesel production is carried out in degraded, cultivated soil, and also with some varieties of natural vegetation in the Amazon. Nevertheless, economic risk associated with the future price of fossil fuels and uncertainties related with carbon subsidy are barriers. Here we discuss the assumptions under which such controversial proposal is based and suggest further analysis for Brazilian decision makers.

TI  - POTENTIAL OF SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN DIFFERENT BIOMES OF BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil is an important pool for C stocks and plays a fundamental role in greenhouse gas emissions and consequently in climatic changes. Land use change can cause either a negative or a positive effect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the intensification of global warming has been confirmed, related mainly to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and adoption of inadequate agricultural land management practices. An inadequate soil use does not only contribute to intensified greenhouse effects but also creates problems related to soil sustainability due to the degradation of soil organic matter, which negatively reflects on soil physical and chemical attributes, as well as on. its biodiversity. On the other hand, best management practices that maintain or even increase soil organic matter contents can minimize the effects of global warming. Examples of such management practices are no-tillage, rehabilitation of degraded pasture, reforestation of marginal lands and elimination of the burning activity among others. The aim of this review was to evaluate some of the main greenhouse gas sources related to agriculture and land use change, to present strategies to mitigate these emissions and to increase C sequestration in the soil-plant system, in. three of the main biomes of Brazil.

TI  - Power, REDD plus and reforming forest governance in Indonesia
T2  - THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the various power relations that shape forest policy and governance reform in Indonesia. It applies Foucault's theories on power to several key initiatives introduced as part of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). By analysing both the operation and the effects of power relations the paper accounts for how competing actors influence major policy change, and the impact different policies have on governing multiple forest users. Sovereign and disciplinary power underpins government attempts to implement new regulatory, planning and enforcement functions across the forest estate. Policy instruments such as the concession moratorium create securitised territorial zones that enable sustainable forest practices to operate. By contrast, forest management units operate through inclusive strategies that discipline forest users into responsible managers, whilst enforcement excludes those who contravene the law. Productive power and resistance explain efforts by government and non-government actors to progress or limit REDD+. Productive power operates through the multiple activities that generate new knowledge on incentivising carbon, and by engaging new subjects in carbon projects. Community resistance draws on discourses and localised subjectivities focussed on forest dependency and rights, whereas industry networks have been adept at positioning REDD+ as a threat to national development.

TI  - Community Forest Management and the Emergence of Multi-Scale Governance Institutions: Lessons for REDD plus Development from Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - At their most local, initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) will depend on rural people to manage forest resources. Although the design of frameworks, mechanisms and arrangements to implement REDD programs have received significant attention, it is not yet clear how REDD+ will function on the ground or how the participation of local populations will be assured. Community forest management (CFM) could be an option under REDD+ depending on how it is negotiated, largely because of the expectation that CFM could reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. Examining institutional factors in the emergence of successful CFM systems and local forest enterprises could provide valuable lessons for REDD planners. We examine cases of CFM development in Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, to assess the role of multi-scaled governance institutions in their development. Comparing and contrasting advanced CFM systems to regions where it is still emerging, we will show how the establishment of a local organizational base for communal resource management is crucial.

TI  - Redesigning Indonesian forest fiscal policy to support forest conservation
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The formulation of fiscal policy in the forestry sector was designed as a green incentive for local governments to conserve forest area in Indonesia. However, evidence demonstrates an increasing rate of deforestation occurred during the implementation of fiscal policy reforms. Thus, problems persist in the implementation of fiscal policies in the forestry sector. This study evaluates the gap between the rule and the implementation of forest fiscal policy, focusing on regulatory, economic, administrative, and informational instruments. There are four main findings of this study. First, there are several inappropriate and even conflicting regulations concerning local government authorities and forest conservation; second, the lack of coordination among agencies is one of the most important factors causing sub-optimal collection of "non-tax state revenues" from the forestry sector; third, forest fiscal policies in Indonesia mostly focus on collecting financial benefits from timber rather than preserving ecosystem functions, and; fourth, there is a weak management information system concerning forest fiscal policy. To address the gaps identified in this study, the implementation of green fiscal policy in the forestry sector must provide a comprehensive regulatory framework and improve the capacity of human resources.

TI  - Gendered Species Preferences Link Tree Diversity and Carbon Stocks in Cacao Agroforest in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which the maintenance of carbon (C) stocks and tree diversity can be jointly achieved in production landscapes is debated. C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha(-1)) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha(-1)). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R-2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses. Maintaining agroforestry in the landscape allows aboveground C stocks up to 50 Mg ha(-1) and reduces biodiversity loss. Agroforestry facilitates climate change mitigation and biodiversity goals to be addressed simultaneously in sustainable production landscapes.

CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Rapid degradation of peatland forest in Indonesia is caused by conversion into plantation forest and agriculture land, including oil palm plantation by farmers. Restoration of peatland is then needed with involvement of local farmers as main stakeholder. This paper presents establishment process and initial result from an action research on peatland restoration using biodiversity enrichment experiment in existing oil palm smallholder plantation to develop oil palm agroforestry. The experiment was established in Sinar Wajo Village, Tanjung Jabung Timur Regency, Jambi Province in which 30 plots in sizes of 25m(2), 100 m(2), and 400 m(2) placed systematically over about 21 ha oil palm plantation belong to a group of farmers. There were 1,180 trees of 6 species, i.e. blangeran (Shorea blangeran), pinang (Areca pinanga), petai (Parkia speciosa), durian (Durio zibethinus), jengkol (Archidendron pauciflorum), and kopi liberika (Coffea liberica) with 0, 3, and 6 diversity levels, created tree island on the sea of oil palms. Approach to local leaders was very important for the initiation of the action research. Focus group discussion with farmer group, provision of seedlings and labour wages were conducted to ensure farmer willingness of participation. Capacity building, such as training on tree cultivation, bio-fertilizer production and study tour was conducted as incentive for farmers. The initial result of plant growth measurement from experiment plots showed 21 months after planting many planted trees grew well. Blangeran as native species of peatland forest showed the best growth performance. Pinang, Kopi Liberika and Durian were also showed relatively good growth performance. Only Petai and Jengkol showed less growth performance. High farmer participation on the establishment of oil palm agroforestry as peatland restoration model was mostly driven by provision of incentives. Oil palm agroforestry is a promising model for restoration of already planted by oil palm peatland area, and involving farmers is important factor for the success of peatland restoration through appropriate social approaches.

TI  - A paradigm shift to CO2 sequestration to manage global warming - With the emphasis on developing countries
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Global land use changes that tend to satisfy the food needs of augmenting population is provoking agricultural soils to act as a carbon (C) source rather than sink. Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DCs land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0-10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DCs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measuring and explaining the willingness to pay for forest conservation: evidence from a survey experiment in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research suggests that there is substantial public support (including willingness to pay) for forest conservation. Based on a nationwide survey experiment in Brazil (N = 2500) the largest and richest of the world's tropical developing countries, we shed new light on this issue. To what extent does the public in fact support forest conservation and what factors are influencing support levels? Unlike previous studies, our results show that the willingness to pay for tropical forest conservation in Brazil is rather low. Moreover, framing forest conservation in terms of biodiversity protection, which tends to create more local benefits, does not induce more support than framing conservation in terms of mitigating global climate change. The results also show that low levels of trust in public institutions have a strong negative impact on the public's willingness to pay for forest conservation, individually and/or via government spending. What could other (richer) countries do, in this context, to encourage forest conservation in Brazil and other tropical developing countries? One key issue is whether prospects of foreign funding for forest conservation are likely to crowd out or, conversely, enhance the motivation for domestic level conservation efforts. We find that prospects of foreign funding have no significant effect on willingness to pay for forest conservation. These findings have at least three policy implications, namely, that the Brazilian public's willingness to pay for forest conservation is very limited, that large-scale international funding is probably needed, and that such funding is unlikely to encourage more domestic effort, but is also unlikely to crowd out domestic efforts. Restoring public trust in the Brazilian government is key to increasing public support for forest conservation in Brazil.

TI  - Litterfall and Associated Macrozoobenthic of Restored Mangrove Forests in Abandoned Aquaculture Ponds
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration projects are now widely established, aiming to regain the carbon benefit of the mangrove ecosystem that is essential for climate change mitigation. This study aimed to investigate mangrove litter as the source of carbon in restored mangrove forests in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, which previously experienced substantial mangrove loss due to shrimp aquaculture development. We assessed the production and decomposition of mangrove litter and associated macrozoobenthic biodiversity in restored forests with plantation age >= 14 years and intact mangrove forests as the reference. The monthly production of three groups of mangrove litter (leaf, reproductive, and wood) was assessed over 12 months. A leaf litter decomposition experiment was performed to inspect the interspecific and disturbance history variation in organic matter formation among four major mangrove species: Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina, and Sonneratia alba. Our results showed that annual litterfall production from restored and intact mangroves in Perancak Estuary were 13.96 and 10.18 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which is equivalent to approximately 6282 and 4581 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) of annual litterfall carbon sink, respectively. Although restored mangroves had significantly higher plant litterfall production than intact mangroves, no significant difference was detected in leaf litter decomposition and macrozoobenthic biodiversity between these forest types.

TI  - Contribution of tillage systems and crop succession to soil structuring
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of conservational systems of soil cultivation has gained importance due to the need for soil preservation and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. With the objective of evaluating soil structuring, this study determined the physical attributes and organic carbon contents of a clayey Oxisol in an area of 10 years under four different land uses: i.e., afforestation (AF), no-tillage system with grass-grass succession (corn/corn), no tillage systems with grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.) and conventional soil tillage system (corn/fallow). The evaluated areas are located in the Cerrado biome of southeastern Brazil. Each area was sampled at 20 points and undisturbed and disturbed samples were collected in the layers of 0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m. The attributes evaluated were related to soil aggregation and porosity and, due to the structure of dependence of the variables, the data were subjected to multivariate factor analysis. We observed that, after a long period, the no-tillage system promoted soil aggregation and porosity similar to those of the planted forest and superior to those of the conventional tillage system. The type of crop succession in the no-tillage system caused differences in soil structure, and grass-grass succession (corn/corn) promoted better soil structure compared to grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.). The greater soil porosity generated by the conventional tillage system was limited to the most superficial layer (0.00-0.10 m) and this effect can be considered ephemeral, due to the presence of a large amount of smaller aggregates that, after the operation, can occupy the generated pores.

TI  - Balancing the Principle of Permanent Sovereign over Natural Resources and Sustainable Forest Management: Indonesian Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF EAST ASIA AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Most scholars argue that the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources (PSNR) has been used by developing countries as a legal basis to exploit their natural resources, including forests, for the sake of economic development. Land conversion and forest burning are the primary causes of forest degradation and deforestation in Indonesia. Thus, the biodiversity of Indonesian tropical forests is decreasing tremendously. This article aims to comprehensively analyze the experiences of the Indonesian government to balance the principle of PSNR and sustainable forest management (SFM). The paper argues that the implementation of the PSNR principle in SFM faces many challenges, such as deforestation, forest degradation, and the failures in implementing laws, as well as weak law enforcement. Therefore, to balance the PSNR principle with SFM, the Indonesian government needs to undertake various efforts, such as strengthening law enforcement, carrying out social forest management, and exercising mandatory forest certification. Moreover, all these efforts need to be further improved.

TI  - Environmental and Socioeconomic Impacts of Utilizing Waste for Biochar in Rural Areas in Indonesia-A Systems Perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar is the product of incomplete combustion (pyrolysis) of organic material. In rural areas, it can be used as a soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Fuel-constrained villagers may however prefer to use biochar briquettes as a higher-value fuel for cooking over applying it to soils. A systems-oriented analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted to analyze these two alternative uses of biochar, applying the study to a rural village system in Indonesia. The results showed soil amendment for enhanced agricultural production to be the preferential choice with a positive benefit to the baseline scenario of -26 ecopoints (LCA) and -173 USD (CBA) annually pr. household. In this case, the positive effects of carbon sequestration to the soil and the economic value of the increased agricultural production outweighed the negative environmental impacts from biochar production and the related production costs. Use of biochar in briquettes for cooking fuel yielded negative net effects in both the LCA and CBA (85 ecopoints and 176 USD), even when positive health effects from reduced indoor air pollution were included. The main reasons for this are that emissions during biochar production are not compensated by carbon sequestration and that briquette making is labor-intensive. The results emphasize the importance of investigating and documenting the carbon storage effect and the agricultural benefit in biochar production-utilization systems for a sustainable use. Further research focus on efficient production is necessary due to the large environmental impact of biochar production. In addition, biochar should continue to be used in those soils where the agricultural effect is most beneficial.

TI  - Prescribed Burning Reduces Large, High-Intensity Wildfires and Emissions in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has recently (2014) changed from a zero-fire policy to an Integrated Fire Management (IFM) program with the active use of prescribed burning (PB) in federal Protected Areas (PA) and Indigenous Territories (IT) of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). PB is commonly applied in the management of fire-prone ecosystems to mitigate large, high-intensity wildfires, the associated emissions, and high fire suppression costs. However, the effectiveness of such fire management in reducing large wildfires and emissions over Brazil remains mostly unevaluated. Here, we aim to fill the gap in the scientific evidence of the PB benefits by relying on the most up-to-date, satellite-derived fire datasets of burned area (BA), fire size, duration, emissions, and intensity from 2003 to 2018. We focused on two Cerrado ITs with different sizes and hydrological regimes, Xerente and Araguaia, where IFM has been in place since 2015. To understand fire regime dynamics, we divided the study period into three phases according to the prevalent fire policy and the individual fire scars into four size classes. We considered two fire seasons: management fire season (MFS, which goes from rainy to mid-dry season, when PBs are undertaken) and wildfires season (WFS, when PBs are not performed and fires tend to grow out of control). Our results show that the implementation of the IFM program was responsible for a decrease of the areas affected by high fire recurrence in Xerente and Araguaia, when compared with the Zero Fire Phase (2008-2013). In both regions, PB effectively reduced the large wildfires occurrence, the number of medium and large scars, fire intensity, and emissions, changing the prevalent fire season from the WFS to the MFS. Such reductions are significant since WFS causes higher negative impacts on biodiversity conservation and higher greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that the effect on wildfires can still be reduced if effective fire management policies, including PB, continue to be implemented during the coming decades.

TI  - Short term effects in soil quality under different cover crops of no tillage vegetables organic production in fragile soils in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Regenerative agriculture practices, including crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage, and no-tillage, have gained recognition for mitigating soil erosion and enhancing soil quality. This study focuses on organic vegetable production in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where soils are sandy and nutrient-poor. The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical-chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance. This research highlights the potential of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops to improve soil fertility, enhance carbon sequestration, and support sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Assessment of water quality in mangrove restoration area based on plankton diversity index in Pangandaran, Southern Coast of West Java, Indonesia.
T2  - Ecology Environment and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Plankton belongs to one of biotic factors, which plays a vital role in their primary productivity as well as water quality indication in aquatic ecosystems such as mangrove areas. A suitable water quality gives significant contribution to biodiversity in a way that they maintain its conservation function. A study of plankton community was conducted based on the analyses of species diversity, dominance, and evenness in mangrove restoration areas of Batukaras and Bulaksetra to assess their reproductive performance as indicator of the water quality in the southern coast of West Java province, Indonesia. This observation was done at 54 spots of two study sites during wet / rainy season in order to assess the primary productivity and plankton community, including its periphyton. The result showed that plankton diversity in Batukaras had higher performance in most of Ecological Indices including the primary productivity performance, as compared to the one in Bulaksetra. The phytoplankton dominated on both study sites was Bacillariophyceae, while zooplankton was dominated by Crustacean. Primary productivity results showed that Batukaras happened to be in euthropic level, while Bulaksetra in mesothrophic one. In general, the results indicate that the areas in both study sites were moderately polluted.

TI  - Carbon payments as a safeguard for threatened tropical mammals
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One reason for the rapid loss of species-rich tropical forests is the high opportunity costs of forest protection. In Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), the expansion of high-revenue oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations currently threatens 3.3 million ha of forest. We estimate that payments for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) could offset the costs of stopping this deforestation at carbon prices of US$ 10-33 per tonne of CO2, or $ 2-16 per tonne if forest conservation targets only cost-efficient areas. Forty globally threatened mammals are found within these planned plantations, including the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Borneo pygmy elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis). Cost-efficient areas for emissions reductions also contain higher-than-average numbers of threatened mammals, indicating that there may be synergies between mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. While many policy and implementation issues need clarification, our economic assessment suggests that REDD could offer a financially realistic lifeline for Kalimantan's threatened mammals if it is included in future climate agreements.

TI  - Implications of local peoples' preferences in terms of income source and land use for Indonesia's national REDD-plus policy: evidence in East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article tries to reveal the field reality in East Kalimantan, especially the preferences of villagers in terms of income source and land use, to ascertain the implications for Indonesia's national REDD-plus policy or one of the emerging regimes under UNFCCC. In forest lands, the villagers have no expectations for labour opportunities involving logging and planting trees in concession areas. In non-forest lands, villagers want to continue practicing swidden agriculture, to expand traditional rubber gardens, and to develop commercialised rubber plantations. They also think that rattan gardens and orchards are important. In order to suppress competition over land used for coal mining and oil palm plantations, to ensure villagers' rights to resources, and to conserve natural resources, it is recommended that Indonesia introduce programmes to support, as REDD-plus activities, the sustainable management of remaining forest and forest-like land uses such as orchards, rattan gardens, and traditional rubber gardens. This study shows the importance of not confining one's perspective to the REDD-plus policy framework determined by the government, but rather evaluating it by checking actual conditions in the field to aid constructive discussion.

TI  - Revealing the spatial variation in biomass uptake rates of Brazil's secondary forests
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for quantifying the carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Tropical secondary forests are significant carbon sinks that sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide. While recent studies have attempted to estimate the AGB recovery rates in tropical forests, considerable uncertainty remains in the estimation of AGB recovery of secondary forests and the spatial variability of the effects that different environmental conditions and degrees of human use may have on AGB recovery. These knowledge gaps hinder further understanding of climate change mitigation potential of secondary forests. Remote sensing products provide spatially and temporally explicit information for understanding and monitoring secondary forest dynamics. To explore the local effects of different factors on AGB of secondary forests in Brazil, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that account for spatial heterogeneity in geospatial data to estimate the AGB of secondary forests in Brazil. Secondary forest areas (29142 polygons) were extracted from Brazil's forest age maps between 1984 and 2019. The AGB of these areas was derived from the Climate Change Initiative Biomass maps. The effects of selected predictors such as forest age, climatic water deficit, the cation exchange capacity of soil and surrounding tree cover were analyzed. The two most influential factors, forest age and surrounding tree cover were utilized to estimate the AGB and the recovery rates per year. Our results show the high spatial variation of different predictors' effects on the AGB of secondary forests. Also, the GWR model (with an adjusted R2 of 0.74) showed considerable improvements regarding "goodness of fit" of models compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (with an adjusted R2 of 0.53). Our estimated average AGB recovery rate across all Brazil's biomes is 7.5 Mg ha -1 yr- 1 (using forest age) for the first 20 years. We presented the map of the spatial variation of AGB recovery rates in Brazil. The estimated AGB recovery rates range using forest age is 28.9 Mg ha -1 yr- 1. Our estimated mean AGB recovery rates of different biomes are 17.7 % on average higher than IPCC default rates. Our results provide baseline information for reducing uncertainties related to carbon sink estimation of secondary forests in Brazil, hence assisting in developing sustainable forest management and ecosystem restoration strategies.

TI  - Fuel load mapping in the Brazilian Cerrado in support of integrated fire management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered to be the most species-rich savannah region in the world, covering 2 million km(2). Uncontrolled late season fires promote deforestation, produce greenhouse gases (similar to 25% of Brazil's land-use related CO2 emissions between 2003 and 2005) and are a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. Governmental institutions therefore implemented early dry season (EDS) prescribed burnings as part of integrated fire management (IFM) in protected areas of the Cerrado, with the aim to reduce the area and severity of late dry season (LDS) fires. The planning and implementation of EDS prescribed burning is supported by satellite-based geo-information on fuel conditions, derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 data. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering algorithm was used to analyse the data, and the relationship between the resulting matched fractions (dry vegetation, green vegetation and soil) and in situ surface fuel samples was assessed. The linear regression of in situ data versus matched filter scores (MF scores) of dry vegetation showed an r(2) of 0.81 (RMSE = 0.15) and in situ data versus MF scores of soil showed an r(2) of 0.65 (RMSE = 0.38). To predict quantitative fuel load, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with MF scores of NPV and soil as predictors (adjusted r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001; standard error = 0.075). The fuel load maps were additionally evaluated by fire managers while planning EDS prescribed burning campaigns. The fuel load mapping approach has proven to be an effective tool for integrated fire management by improving the planning and implementation of prescribed burning, promoting pyrodiversity, prioritising fire suppression and evaluating fire management efforts to meet overall conservations goals. National and state level authorities have successfully institutionalized the approach and it was incorporated into IFM policies in Brazil.

TI  - Local stakeholders' assessment of community-based forest management and the implications for REDD Plus implementation in the Philippines
T2  - ASIA LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Philippines is one of the pioneers to adopt participatory approach in forest management, as embodied in. its national strategy for sustainable forest management and social justice in the uplands, called Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM). The program's almost three decades of implementation saw positive impacts on the livelihood assets of local communities. CBFM has evolved to tackle global concerns as well, such as climate change and biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, international climate change negotiations have drawn a means to provide financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD Plus). This mechanism hopes to bring "triple benefits", namely: emission reduction, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. Given their parallel goals, CBFM sites are promising candidates for implementing REDD Plus, and the latter is expected to have important implications on the process and potential outcomes of CBFM. This paper looks into the local stakeholders' assessment of the impacts of CBFM on the livelihood assets of local communities and the potentials of REDD Plus implementation in the future. The literature is replete with examples emphasizing the importance of local stakeholder's participation in REDD Plus, yet their perception particularly on the added value it gives remained unclear. Results of the study revealed that CBFM implementation contributed largely to building the capital assets of people organization (PO) members, especially the human, social, natural and physical capitals. Full positive effects have yet to be realized though for the financial capital. PO members and the local institutions (DENR, LGU, NGO) expressed optimism, though with varied levels, on REDD Plus further enhancing the above capital assets. This optimism, however, does not translate to confidence in achieving the triple-benefits, as risks are also perceived by PO members posed by the likely creation of forest enclosures that could limit areas for livelihood activities. If realized, improved economic conditions could also encourage in-migration that would increase pressure to the forests. Caution should therefore be exercised in implementing REDD Plus to ensure that the intended goals are achieved in the context of views and aspirations of local stakeholders.

TI  - Clear consensus among international public for government action at COP26: patriotic and public health frames produce marginal gains in support
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work surveys over 14,000 respondents in seven countries to assess support for government action to protect the environment, and for different policies at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. Baseline results reveal overwhelming support for action. At least nine out of ten respondents in six countries, and 79% in the USA, agree that all governments should do more. In each country, at least 50% of respondents express support for four policies: protecting wildlife; planting trees; spending more on clean technologies; and reducing the production of greenhouse gases over thirty years. A survey-experiment tests whether support changes when respondents are exposed to short texts framed in different ways. On average, exposure to a patriotism or public health text significantly raises support for action, albeit by only 1.6 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. On policies, exposure to either a public health text or a text based on current UN messaging increases support for tree planting by 2.3 and 2.9 percentage points respectively. These results suggest that international public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of government action at COP26. They highlight policies that are likely to attract majority support, and suggest that message-framing can have a very small impact.

TI  - Peatlands of the Madre de Dios River of Peru: Distribution, Geomorphology, and Habitat Diversity
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present results of research concerning the distribution, depth, volume, geomorphology, and habitat diversity of peatlands in the southern Peruvian Amazon. We identified 295 peatlands covering 294 km(2) and ranging in size from 10 to 3,500 ha. Individual peatlands were mostly restricted to the meander belt of the Madre de Dios River. Mean peat depth was 2.54 +/- 1.84 m (n = 429), however we encountered depths to 9 m and 10% of the measurements exceeded 5 m. We developed a calibration factor to calculate peat volume across the study area, estimating total peat volume within 295 peatlands at 657 +/- 119 Mm(3). An interpolated depth map of subsurface morphology of a single peatland showed that fluvial features were well-conserved beneath several meters of peat and three distinct subsurface geomophological units defined by peat depth could be identified: the Primary Basin, Secondary Basin, and Intrabasin flats. Subsurface geomorphology resulted in increased within-habitat heterogeneity and explained 35% of the variation of pixel values extracted from Landsat (TM) imagery. Representing a hydrological link from elevated uplands to the lower floodplains, peatlands in Madre de Dios are especially threatened on local scales by habitat alteration in the uplands and gold mining in the floodplains.

TI  - Combined effect of intercropping and minimum tillage on soil carbon sequestration and organic matter pools in the semiarid region of Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two intercropping systems and minimum soil tillage in the semiarid region of Brazil on soil organic carbon (SOC) and pools of soil organic matter (SOM), compared with the native vegetation (NV). The first intercropping was cultivated with beans, sesame and pigeon pea, whereas the second was cultivated with cotton, maize, beans, sesame and pigeon pea. Two areas under NV, adjacent to the crop areas, were also sampled. Soil sampling were collected from 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm layers in three plots per area to characterise the SOM (SOC, soil nitrogen, humic substances, microbial biomass, and mineralisable carbon). Our results demonstrated that, when compared with the NV, intercropping systems conducted with minimum soil tillage were effective in maintaining and sometimes increasing the levels and stocks of SOC and some SOM fractions such as microbial C and humic substances, and therefore, these systems can be an alternative form of sustainable soil management in the semiarid region of Brazil.

TI  - CO2 REMOVAL ASSOCIATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LAND COVER IN THE IGUASSU RIVER WATERSHED, BRAZIL, DURING 2000-2010
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work was conducted in the Iguassu River watershed, within the limits of the state of Parana, Brazil, in order to assess the dynamics of the forest cover and carbon stocks in that basin, between the years 2000 and 2010, estimating the variation of the quantity of carbon stored in forest vegetation in this period. The cover mapping was carried out by means of Landsat 5 satellite images from a TM sensor. Processes of segmentation were used for the generation of vectors with homogeneous characteristics and classification was made through visual interpretation. Two classes of successional stage of secondary vegetation: initial and intermediate/advanced were considered, as well as a reforestation class. The quantification of carbon stocks was made by the indirect method, applying reference values from the literature. There was an increase around 22.93% of forest cover in the basin throughout the period of 10 years. Similary, there was an increase in biomass production and carbon sequestration, of 135.58 Tg of biomass (32.81% of the, original), thus accomplishing the fixation of 206.81 Tg of carbon equivalent. It is concluded that the native forest is mostly responsible for carbon storage in the basin, with similar to 93.53% of the total carbon stored in 2010. Thus, the vegetation of the basin is contributing positively to the reduction of CO2 concentration of in the atmosphere, and consequently of the negative effects from the greenhouse effect.

TI  - Carbon stock in rubber tree plantations in Western Ghana and Mato Grosso (Brazil)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivation of rubber trees on non-forested land could act as a carbon sink by sequestering carbon in biomass and indirectly in soils. International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration.The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 12-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil.Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 CM (C] 70) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree(-1)) (r(2) = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C(170) depended both on components and sites.Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha(-1)) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r(2) = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha(-1)) than in MG (41.7 t C ha(-1)), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the around, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools.For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha(-1), in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites.In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, these results could be useful when drafting a Project Design Document (PDD) for Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (AR-CDM).

TI  - Land allocation to meet sectoral goals in Indonesia An analysis of policy coherence
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee.food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals.

TI  - IMPACT OF CONVERTING AREAS CULTIVATED WITH SUGARCANE TO EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS ON SOIL QUALITY IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation is considered an effective method to improve soil quality and drain atmospheric CO2 by sequestering carbon, in both soil and vegetation. In this regard, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of converting areas cultivated with sugarcane to eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus spp.) on soil quality and carbon sequestration in a Latossolo (Ferralsol) in the Atlantic Forest region of the Alagoas state, Brazil, through multivariate analysis. The systems under evaluation consisted of four areas: one area cultivated with sugarcane for approximately 20 years, taken as the reference area of this study, and the other three adjacent areas cultivated with eucalypt at 1 (E1), 3 (E3) and 6 (E6) years of age, previously cultivated with sugarcane. Physical (bulk density - BD, Mean weight-diameter - MWD, geometric mean diameter - GMD and aggregate stability index - ASI), chemical (soil organic carbon - SOC, total nitrogen - TN, labile carbon - LC and recalcitrant carbon - RC) and biological (Microbial biomass carbon - MBC, soil carbon respiration - C-CO2 and metabolic quotient - qCO(2)) properties of soil were evaluated. Data were collected, standardized and submitted to exploratory analysis with principal components. The results show that SOC, LC, TN, GMD, MWD and ASI increased, while BD showed a reduction in E3 and E6 systems. The conversion of sugarcane cultivation with burning of straw and manual harvest into eucalypt plantations was efficient at promoting SOC sequestration and improving physical, chemical and biological properties of soil.

TI  - Agricultural practices to improve near-surface soil health and crop yield in subtropical soils
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS) have the potential to minimize soil degradation, improve soil health, and maximize food production. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of no-till (NT) in association with ICLS on soil health and soybean yield in Inceptisol and Oxisol soils in Southern Brazil. The response of physical, chemical, and biological soil health indicators to soil and crop management systems was measured over the short- (<5 years) and long-term (>10 years) under ICLS with soybean in spring/summer and forage grazed by cattle in the autumn/winter. A soil management index was calculated for each soil based on ICLS management. Independent of soil type, ICLS in association with NT for 10(+) years improved chemical and biological properties in the near soil surface (0-6 cm depth). The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) scores for soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and bulk density were close to 1.0 in the Inceptisol, independent of management or soil depth, while the pH scores were lower in the ICLS topsoil. For the Oxisol, the SMAF scores for SOC and P were approximately 1.0 in the 0-6 cm depth under long-term ICLS. The SMAF overall soil quality index was high (approximately 0.9) for both soils and there were no significant differences between management practices. Overall, the adoption of ICLS in association with NT (i) improved or maintained soil health, (ii) promoted soil carbon sequestration, and (iii) increased soybean yield in the studied soils. This study confirmed the potential for conservation practices (ICLS combined with NT) to improve soil quality with environmental sustainability.

TI  - Three Generations of Forest Peoples' Empowerment in Indonesia: Process Towards Sustainable and Equitable Forest Management
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities that alter land cover have destroyed natural ecosystems and caused conflict. In Indonesia, community-based forest management (CBFM) policies implemented by the government seek to empower communities, ameliorate forest conversion, and reduce environmental conflict. This article critically assesses contemporary CBFM policy in Indonesia by analyzing its history and outcomes through policy analysis. To systematically review previous literature on CBFM, this research uses the PRISMA method. It finds that communities are often able to manage forest areas sustainably through sociocultural systems that combine management customs and culture. Empowerment through CBFM policy therefore promises to promote community subsistence, equity, and security regarding forest management. However, granting total resource rights to communities can result in land conversion unless managerial safeguards are in place. Many studies find that the clarity of land boundaries, the consistency of regulation, and the partiality of land governance drive CBFM program success. To facilitate land governance for the successful implementation of Indonesian social forestry, communities need access rights, authority to manage forests, and sufficient knowledge transfer to participate in formal forest management. In contrast to previous iterations of CBFM in Indonesia, current social forestry policy acknowledges these governance needs and seeks to implement them.

TI  - Returning forests analyzed with the forest identity
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Amid widespread reports of deforestation, some nations have nevertheless experienced transitions from deforestation to reforestation. In a causal relationship, the Forest Identity relates the carbon sequestered in forests to the changing variables of national or regional forest area, growing stock density per area, biomass per growing stock volume, and carbon concentration in the biomass. It quantifies the sources of change of a nation's forests. The Identity also logically relates the quantitative impact on forest expanse of shifting timber harvest to regions and plantations where density grows faster. Among 50 nations with extensive forests reported in the Food and Agriculture Organization's comprehensive Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005, no nation where annual per capita gross domestic product exceeded $4,600 had a negative rate of growing stock change. Using the Forest Identity and national data from the Assessment report, a single synoptic chart arrays the 50 nations with coordinates of the rates of change of basic variables, reveals both clusters of nations and outliers, and suggests trends in returning forests and their attributes. The Forest Identity also could serve as a tool for setting forest goals and illuminating how national policies accelerate or retard the forest transitions that are diffusing among nations.

TI  - Use of waste wood as an alternative to improve environmental conditions in the system of reforestation in Tailandia-PA
T2  - Acta Amazonica
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial portion of soils in the Amazon has low fertility and high acidity indexes. The low levels of technology used in land management and in the use of fire has been pointed out as the main cause of alteration of areas covered by forests. Inadequate soil management, either while planting forest species or agricultural crops, leads to environmental modifications, such as erosion, water pollution and loss of nutrients and biodiversity. Despite the difficulty to measure the degree of recovery of those areas, we may assume that an altered area, whatever environment or land use type it is submitted, would be in recovery phase when the status of its organic matter is improving. This can be measured through soil biological indicators such as levels of organic matter and nutrients, and activity of the microbiological biomass. It also influences the quality of the planted specimens in terms of tree diameter and height, and aerial biomass. Areas currently under recovery or recovered in their edaphological properties can be compared, through the use of bioindicators, to soils enriched with organic material from organic soil management in the past, such as forest systems planted in areas of black earths. This comparison, besides validating soil quality indicators, will be helpful in studies involving rational use of both natural and planted forests.

TI  - Transaction and abatement costs of carbon-sink projects in developing countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Projects in the forestry sector, and land-use change and forestry projects more generally, have the potential to help mitigate global warming by acting as sinks for greenhouse gasses, particularly CO(2). However, concerns have been expressed that participation in carbon-sink projects may be constrained by high costs. This problem may be particularly severe for projects involving smallholders in developing countries. Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia. A typology of transaction costs is presented and related to existing pilot projects. The paper concludes with recommendations to reduce the disadvantages that smallholders may face in capturing the opportunities offered by carbon markets.

TI  - Fertilizer effects on the sustainability and profitability of agroforestry in the presence of carbon payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforests, where trees are planted with crops, are promoted as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture as they meet landholder demands for food, income and wood products. This is essential in countries such as Indonesia where much of the landmass is not suitable for intensive cropping (either too steep or the soils are acidic and nutrient poor), yet population pressure and increasing food demand force many farmers to implement such practices on marginal land. These practices, combined with the lack of credit, quality seed and fertilizer have contributed to decreased soil fertility and increased deforestation and soil erosion. Previous research on agroforests suggests, however, that sustainability and profitability are not guaranteed and that the addition of fertilizer to the production system may be required. This is investigated for a hedgerow-intercropping system in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments using a bioeconomic modelling framework that incorporates the SCUAF simulation model. For the assumptions used in this study it was found that fertilizer improves the productivity and sustainability of the system; it is either optimal to grow crops (Zea mays) alone provided 225 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of fertilizer is applied, or to completely convert to growing trees (Gliricidia sepium) if fertilizer is not used. This decision depends on the relative prices for crops and carbon. It was also found that there is an incentive for landholders to participate in a carbon-sink project when the previous land use has a continuously decreasing carbon stock, which is the baseline used to determine eligible carbon. Finally, compared with a more complex process model such as WaNuLCAS and data reported in the literature, the process model SCUAF consistently and reliably predicted biophysical interactions for various management regimes of tree/crop systems for use in complex economic analyses.

TI  - Impact of Community Forest Management on Biomass Carbon Stocks in the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management can result in net losses of carbon stock. To quantify the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 +/- 9.66 MgC ha(-1). Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3% in one managed area (MA1) and 8.3% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the reductions found for higher impact forest management and other experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas and in their respective control areas.

TI  - Low conservation value of converted habitat for avifauna in tropical peatland on Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Peat swamp forest is an important refuge for biodiversity in Southeast Asia and is now becoming a target of exploitation. The scarcity of information on avifauna and ecology of birds in peat swamp forests prevents understanding of the effects of land use change on avifauna. In this study, we describe the bird assemblages in habitats with different land uses by comparing species richness, community composition, and feeding guild patterns in Bukit Batu, Indonesia. Bird assemblages in natural peat swamp forests (NPF), high-maintenance industrial acacia plantations (planted acacia forest, PAF), low-maintenance rubber plantations (jungle rubber forest, JRF), and village areas (VIL) were studied using a fixed-radius point-count method. Of the 95 species observed, 45, 20, 35, and 48 species were observed in NPF, PAF, JRF, and VIL, respectively. Estimated species richness was the highest in NPF, followed by VIL, JRF, and PAF. NPF had the highest species diversity and beta-diversity, more endangered species, and a distinctive species composition characterized by fly-catching insectivores. The relative conservation value of PAF was notably low, particularly compared with JRF. The avifauna in VIL was characterized by more generalists that favor open spaces and therefore is not considered an important habitat for forest-dependent birds that are of conservation concern. Our results indicate that NPF has irreplaceable value for bird diversity conservation, but low-maintenance rubber plantations were home to several forest-dependent species and partially supported bird diversity, particularly compared with high-maintenance acacia plantations.

TI  - The role of women in early REDD plus implementation: lessons for future engagement
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers and practitioners have amply discussed the potential of REDD+ to help or harm forest-based communities, but less attention has been paid to its gender dimensions. Safeguard policies are aimed at ensuring that REDD+ does not harm women, but interventions that do not seek to address imbalances at the outset may be doomed to perpetuate them. Based on research by the Center for International Forestry Research in 77 villages in 20 REDD+ sites across six countries, this article finds that women - even where they use forests as much or more - have been less involved in REDD+ initiative design decisions and processes than men, a situation with potentially significant implications for implementation and future outcomes. This article uses the research findings to argue that "participation", while a central demand of indigenous and other local communities more generally, is only a partial solution to addressing women's strategic needs in ways that could strengthen their position in REDD+. Rather, gender-responsive analyses are needed to understand real and perceived gender differences and anticipate risks.

TI  - Linking physical quality and CO2 emissions under long-term no-till and conventional-till in a subtropical soil in Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The decomposition rate of soil organic matter (SOM) is affected by soil management practices and particularly by the physical and hydraulic attributes of the soil. Previous studies have indicated that the SOM decomposition is influenced by the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR). Therefore, the objective of this study was to relate the C-CO2 emissions to the LLWR of the surficial layer of soil under two management systems: no-tillage (NT), conducted for 20 years, and conventional tillage (CT). Soil in NT presented greater soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks than in CT. Emissions of C-CO2 were greater in the NT than in the CT, because of the greater carbon stocks in the soil surface layer and the greater biological activity (due to the improvement of the soil structure) in NT as compared to CT. The use of LLWR associated with the measurement of C-CO2 emissions from the soil could help to predict the efficacy of the adopted management system for trapping carbon in the soil.

TI  - EVALUATING EARLY POST-FIRE TROPICAL LOWER MONTANE FOREST RECOVERY IN INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about post-fire tropical montane forest succession in Indonesia. It is an important step to understand whether forests are recovering and if there is a need for reforestation or other rehabilitation efforts. This study assessed the structure and composition of post-fire forest regrowth in Raden Soerjo Grand Forest Park, a conservation forest management unit in East Java, Indonesia. Three high-severity burn units were sampled to assess forest response across a range of post-fire recovery times and one or two fire entries. Mean stems and basal area per unit by size class (tree, pole, sapling and seedling) and tree size class distribution by species, and mean percent cover of understory by life form were calculated. It was found that units experiencing short-term absence of fire and two fire entries were dominated by non-tree understory vegetation, including high grass cover, indicating that understory cover may hamper the establishment of tree regeneration. It was also found that higher species diversity and richness followed a single fire entry. The results provided a better understanding of early post-fire forest recovery. Managers should actively monitor burned areas and plan for active restoration, especially if non-forest vegetation dominates the area for a long period (> 8 years), or after a second fire entry.

TI  - Optimal rotations on Eucalyptus plantations including carbon sequestration -: A comparison of results in Brazil and Spain
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IUFRO International Meeting on Economics and Management of High Productivity Plantations
CL  - Lugo, SPAIN
AB  - Economically optimal rotations are not frequently employed in Eucalyptus plantations management despite eucalypts' economic importance to the pulp industry. The coppice regeneration method used to manage eucalypts leads to a simultaneous optimization problem. In such cases, the manager has to simultaneously define the optimal age in each coppice rotation and the optimal number of coppice rotations for each plantation full cycle. The dynamic nature of the problem of looking for the optimal set of coppice rotations for Eucalyptus plantations obliges managers to use the dynamic programming technique. In order to evaluate the economic loss occasioned when optimal rotations are not considered, two plantations are shown, one with Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake in Brazil and another with Eucalyptus globulus Labill in Spain. Different clearcut ages are established in each country, 5-9 years in Brazil, and 13-18 years in Spain. A multiple products context (wood and carbon) is considered in this paper. The results show different rotations and optimal number of coppice rotations for each site index and case considered. To repeat tfhe seedling rotation in the following coppice rotations usually is not the best option. Besides, the optimal cycle and the land expectation value vary when carbon sequestration is evaluated for the two plantations considered. Finally, on some occasions the results are very sensitive to changes in parameters like the carbon price and discount rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A preliminary ornithological assessment and conservation evaluation of the PT Daisy logging concession, Berau district, east Kalimantan, Indonesia.
T2  - Forktail
M3  - Article
AB  - An ornithological survey in the PT Daisy logging concession, Berau district, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was undertaken as part of a wider research effort to provide baseline data on its biodiversity in order to facilitate improved forest management. PT Daisy retains almost 30% of primary terrestrial forest, whilst 45% of the concession has now been logged. A total of 230 bird species were recorded including six Vulnerable, 47 Near Threatened and two restricted-range species. Compared to other protected areas in Kalimantan, the bird species diversity of PT Daisy is above average, but the reserve supports fewer globally threatened species and restricted-range species. The bird fauna of PT Daisy shows greatest similarity with Gunung Palung and Tanjung Puting National Parks. The undisturbed mixed dipterocarp lowland forests of PT Daisy are likely to be typical of the Sangkulirang Peninsula. At a landscape level, PT Daisy is important since it is part of a currently contiguous forest chain running through the Sangkulirang Peninsula. The best current conservation opportunity for forests in the peninsula is probably under a sustainable forest management regime. The current unsustainable approach to forest management at PT Daisy will inevitably lead to seriously reduced levels of biodiversity.

TI  - Wildlife conservation in Bornean timber concessions
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on an extensive review of the literature, and broad consultation with experts, we have assessed the sensitivity of Bornean vertebrates to the direct and indirect effects of timber harvest. Well-implemented selective logging has a relatively limited direct impact on wildlife populations: few species appear quite sensitive, some benefit, some decline. However, current management practices in Indonesian Borneo generally cause a decline in wildlife populations. Guidelines for sustainable forest management are primarily focused on trees, with few specific recommendations on how to sustainably manage wildlife populations in timber concessions. Based on our findings, we provide extensive wildlife management guidelines, pointing out the importance of maintaining understory vegetation and large trees for fruit, seed, dead wood, and tree hollow production, limiting canopy gaps, and reducing hunting and wildlife trade in concessions. In addition, we provide specific management advice on high priority species of Bornean vertebrates.

TI  - LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S BENEFIT TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS IN INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation efforts in Indonesia in the last decade have been using many strategies to integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK). Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WETLANDS ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Symposium on Wetlands Environmental Management (ISWEM)
CL  - Banjarbaru, INDONESIA
AB  - Recently, paddy fields have encountered extreme environmental conditions like flood and storm which caused decreased grain production. To overcome this problem, National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN) of Republic of Indonesia has developed hybrid rice varieties like Atomita, Sulutan Unsrat, Woyla, etc. However, there are few reports on population of bacteria, fungi, and the methane (CH4) emissions as affected by these rice varieties in tidal swamp area of Kalimantan. A field experiment has been carried in tidal swamp of South Kalimantan aiming at elucidating the effect of irradiated rice varieties on CH4, population of bacteria and fungi. Sixteen plots, each sizing 3 m x 4 m, were demarcated by plastic tape. At the same time with land preparation, rice varieties of Atomita (irradiated), Sulutan Unsrat (irradiated), Woyla (irradiated) and Karang Dukuh ( local variety) were nursed in nearby upland until one month old. Three of the plots were cultivated to Atomita rice variety, three of the plots were cultivated to Sulutan Unsrat rice variety, while the other three were cultivated to Woyla rice variety. The rest of the plots were cultivated to Karang Dukuh and considered as control treatment. Air samples were collected by closed chambers in biweekly bases until harvest of rice. Air samples were then transferred to laboratory and used for the determination of CH4 concentration. Soil samples were taken at 15, 45, 75 and 105 days after transplanting and used for determinations of bacterial and fungal numbers using plate count method. The results showed that irradiated rice varieties suppressed CH4 emissions from tidal swamp paddy filed. More suppression was given by Sulutan Usrat, while Atomita and Woyla gave similar affects. There were no differences in population of bacteria in the four rice variety except at 15 days after transplanting when Atomica gave highest number. Similarly, there was no difference in population of fungi in the four rice variety except at 45 days after rice transplanting when Sulutan Unsrat gave highest number. These suggest that irradiated rice varieties suppressed CH4 emissions without negative impact on the bacterial and fungal population in tidal swamp soil of Kalimantan.

TI  - Response of a dung beetle assemblage along a reforestation gradient in Restinga forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.

TI  - Richness of bats species (Mammalia, Chiroptera) in two different habitats in the center south region, Parana, Brazil.
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Preliminary study about the richness of species and the capture frequency of bats from two habitats: native forest and Araucaria reforestation area, in the center east region of Parana.The same capture effort for the two areas resulted in 11 species of bats captured in the native forest and eight in the Araucaria reforestation area. The uniformity in species abundance - evenness - was higher in the native forest. In the Araucaria reforestation area, ninety per cent of the collected individuals belonged only to two species. Results show that the primary forest with numerous niches presents high richness of species, but human action reduces the general richness, which reflects mainly in the small number of species. Myotis ruber is registered in both environments and related in the Brazilian list of threatened species of extinction.

TI  - Annual fires reduce local species richness but do not homogenize the composition of savanna woody species
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Savanna woody species evolved with fire. However, the effect of changes in the fire regimes, which tend to increase in the next decades, is not yet fully understood. Here, we tested the effects of increased fire frequency on species richness and the composition of woody plant communities. Specifically, we tested if a high frequency fire management reduces local species richness of communities and homogenizes species composition. We sampled woody plants in 40 sites, distributed in 20 pairs, in Emas National Park (Brazil). Each pair included sites with high fire frequency (firebreaks that are burned annually since 1994) and with natural fire frequency (occurring every 3-5 years). We used a paired t-test to assess effects of the two fire frequency treatments on species richness and permutation tests to compare distance decay in similarity composition and relative abundances. We found that sites with high fire frequency had lower species richness compared to their paired sites subjected to natural fire frequency. However, similarities in species composition among sites with high fire frequency were only slightly higher than among sites subjected to natural fire frequency. The rate of distance decay in similarity was similar on the two treatments. At local scales, the high frequency of fire reduced species richness, an impact that in the long run may be irreversible. However, at broader spatial scales, effects were small as two treatments included similar sets of species. Prescribed fires have the potential to modify the natural dynamics of the woody communities in the savannas we studied. In our study, fire appears to act as a hierarchical filter, selecting species at broader spatial scales and nesting communities at local scales.

TI  - Let the Women Harvest the Mangrove. Carbon Policy, and Environmental Injustice
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon policy is a fascinating topic in geography and political ecology, because carbon is a new exchangeable good, which links the local to the international arenas through a complex set of instruments, norms, and institutions. In this paper, after explaining my theoretical and conceptual framework rooted in Africanist geography and currents of political ecology, I analyze the responses of local actors (knowledge, practices, logic, and strategies) to environmental policies and consider the effects of new mechanisms, upon local dynamics in Africa. I focus my attention on the impacts of mangrove reforestation policies on women, who harvest shellfish. My research, conducted over 35 years on coastal mangroves in Africa and Madagascar, provides me with examples. Through a long-term approach to the perception of mangroves and the changing modes of policies, I highlight the weight of imperialism and neo-liberalism and analyze types of environmental injustice against mangrove harvesters, particularly the women, who are the most directly concerned by the preservation of their heritage and are rarely recognized as stakeholders in environmental policies that are defined internationally and implemented at national and local levels. They are not informed (or are deliberately kept unware) of new devices such as REDD+. They have lost their rights of access to the reforested mangrove areas. Carbon policy requires comparative and empirical research, giving voice to local actors, especially women, about their perceptions of policies and actions. The approaches in terms of political ecology must be combined with analysis of the bio-ecological and socio-cultural dynamics of the mangrove.

TI  - Sustainability Assessment of Araucaria Forest Remnants in Southern Brazil: Insights from Traditional Forest Inventory Surveys
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise estimates of dendrometric and morphometric variables are indispensable for effective forest resource conservation and sustainable utilization. This study focuses on modeling the relationships between shape (morphometric), dimension (dendrometric) and density (N) to assess the sustainability of forest resources. It sheds light on the current state of site characteristics, reproduction, and the structure of Araucaria angustifolia trees at selected forest remnants across multiple sites in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil. Individual trees and their dendrometric variables, such as the diameter at breast height (d), height (h), crown base height (cbh), annual periodic increment (API) in growth rings, and morphometric variables, including four radii of the crown in cardinal directions, were evaluated. These measurements allowed us to calculate various morphometric indices and crown efficiency, enabling the assessment of both vertical and horizontal structural conditions. Statistical analysis confirmed a positive relationship of the crown volume (cv) and crown surface area (csa) with the crown length (cl). Conversely, the crown efficiency, density, increment rate, and reproductive structure production declined. These morphometric relationships emphasize the complex dynamics within these forest ecosystems, irrespective of the chosen site, indicating that horizontal and vertical forest structures have stagnated and have been characterized by limited change in the last ten years. Such results raise concerns about sustainability, highlighting the need for proper conservation measures and sustainable forest management practices. Our findings underscore the need for substantial adjustments in the structure and dynamics of the forest, particularly on selected rural properties where this tree species is abundant, to ensure long-term sustainability.

TI  - Forest certification in Amazonia: standards matter
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification promises international consumers that 'green-label' timber has been logged sustainably. However, recent research indicates that this is not true for ipe (Tabebuia spp.), currently flooding the US residential decking market, much of it logged in Brazil. Uneven or non-application of minimum technical standards for certification could undermine added value and eventually the certification process itself. We examine public summary reports by third-party certifiers describing the evaluation process for certified companies in the Brazilian Amazon to determine the extent to which standards are uniformly applied and the degree to which third-party certifier requirements for compliance are consistent among properties. Current best-practice harvest systems, combined with Brazilian legal norms for harvest levels, guarantee that no certified company or community complies with FSC criteria and indicators specifying species-level management. No guidelines indicate which criteria and indicators must be enforced, or to what degree, for certification to be conferred by third-party assessors; nor do objective guidelines exist for evaluating compliance for criteria and indicators for which adequate scientific information is not yet available to identify acceptable levels. Meanwhile, certified companies are expected to monitor the long-term impacts of logging on biodiversity in addition to conducting best-practice forest management. This burden should reside elsewhere. We recommend a clarification of 'sustained timber yield' that reflects current state of knowledge and practice in Amazonia. Quantifiable verifiers for best-practice forest management must be developed and consistently employed. These will need to be flexible to reflect the diversity in forest structure and dynamics that prevails across this vast region. We offer suggestions for how to achieve these goals.

TI  - From eco-catastrophe to zero deforestation? Interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009-2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.

TI  - International and Domestic Sustainable Forest Management Policies: Distributive Effects on Power among State Agencies in Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The last two decades of forest policy discussions have been dominated by calls for sustainable management of forest resources. Consequently, multiple international and domestic policies, supporting sustainable forest management (SFM), have evolved in numerous jurisdictions. Policies in developing countries often rely on foreign donors' projects, which supplement domestic SFM policy. These policies assign various policy tasks to specific public bureaucracies, who then compete for these very tasks, as well as the related staff and budgets. Therefore, project and policy task assignment greatly influences bureaucratic power. This article analyzes the distributive effects of SFM policy on power (in terms of coercion, incentives and dominant information) among relevant domestic and foreign donor bureaucracies in Bangladesh. Concepts from power theory, bureaucratic politics theory, and concepts of policy and policy process were combined to analyze 121 Bangladeshi SFM policies from 1992-2013, which assign a total of 1012 policy tasks to specific public bureaucracies. Using qualitative content analysis, inferences about power were assigned to specific competing bureaucracies by the totality of SFM policies made. Results identify domestic and foreign bureaucracies whose power distribution benefit most from the SFM policies viz. their competitors. It is concluded that bureaucracies gaining the most power set the limits and directions in designing, implementing and evaluating various elements of any national SFM policies.

TI  - 8000 years of vegetation dynamics and environmental changes of a unique inland peat ecosystem of the Jambi Province in Central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their importance as global carbon sinks, peatlands of Southeast Asia have been rarely studied and our current knowledge of the dynamics and ecology of these ecosystems remains incomplete. Paleoecological and palynological multi-proxy analyses including analysis of pollen, spores, charcoal, testate amoebae and sediments were carried out on a 733 cm-long core taken from the Air Hitam peatland in the Jambi Province, Central Sumatra, Indonesia. The radiocarbon chronology reveals that peat formation started ca. 7800 years ago. The site was covered by dipterocarp-swamp mixed rainforest during the first 2000 years, after which freshwater swamp taxa became more important, in particular Durio trees. This lasted until ca. 4500 years ago, when the swamp vegetation shifted to a pole forest with abundant Pandanus thickets in response to a system change from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. For this period, macro-charcoal analysis reveals that fire frequency increased, possibly as a consequence of climate change linked to the onset of the modern El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the late Holocene. The ombrogenous Pandanus-pole forest phases were characterized by lower water table fluctuations and higher peat accumulation rates. The area of Air Hitam has been for thousands of years a highly effective carbon sequestering peatland. Natural climate variability in the past did not affect the carbon storage function as suggested by the general increase in peat accumulation during relatively drier phases and increasing ENSO variability in the late Holocene. However, the recent changes caused by selective logging, drainage and conversion to oil palm plantations, have caused a decline in the peat swamp forest communities changing the ecological functions of the peatland. It is likely that the accumulated carbon will be released in the atmosphere due to exposure to aerobic conditions and its function will be lost unless a better management of the watershed is applied.

TI  - Influence of carbon mapping and land change modelling on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of an international programme for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) can help to mitigate climate change and bring numerous benefits to environmental conservation. Information on land change modelling and carbon mapping can contribute to quantify future carbon emissions from deforestation. However limitations in data availability and technical capabilities may constitute an obstacle for countries interested in participating in the REDD programme. This paper evaluates the influence of quantity and allocation of mapped carbon stocks and expected deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation. The paper introduces the conceptual space where quantity and allocation are involved in predicting carbon emissions, and then uses the concepts to predict carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon, using previously published information about carbon mapping and deforestation modelling. Results showed that variation in quantity of carbon among carbon maps was the most influential component of uncertainty, followed by quantity of predicted deforestation. Spatial allocation of carbon within carbon maps was less influential than quantity of carbon in the maps. For most of the carbon maps, spatial allocation of deforestation had a minor but variable effect on the prediction of carbon emissions relative to the other components. The influence of spatial carbon allocation reaches its maximum when 50% of the initial forest area is deforested. The method can be applied to other case studies to evaluate the interacting effects of quantity and allocation of carbon with future deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation.

AB  - Forestry and peat land including land-based is one of the critical sectors in the inventory of CO2 emissions and mitigation efforts of climate change. The present study analyzed the land-use and land-cover changes between 2006 and 2012 in North Sumatra, Indonesia with emphasis to CO2 emissions. The land-use/land-cover consists of twenty-one classes. Redd Abacus software version 1.1.7 was used to measure carbon emission source as well as the predicted (2)carbon dioxide emissions from 2006-2024. Results showed that historical emission (2006-2012) in this province, significant increases in the intensive land use namely dry land agriculture (109.65%), paddy field (16.23%) and estate plantation (15.11%). On the other hand, land-cover for forest decreased significantly: secondary dry land forest (7.60%), secondary mangrove forest (9.03%), secondary swamp forest (33.98%), and the largest one in the mixed dry land agriculture (79.96%). The results indicated that North Sumatra province is still a CO2 emitter, and the most important driver of emissions mostly derived from agricultural lands that contributed (2)carbon dioxide emissions by 48.8%, changing from forest areas into degraded lands (classified as barren land and shrub) shared 30.6% and estate plantation of 22.4%. Mitigation actions to reduce carbon emissions was proposed such as strengthening the forest land, rehabilitation of degraded area, development and plantation forest, forest protection and forest fire control, and reforestation and conservation activity. These mitigation actions have been simulated to reduce 15% for forestry and 18% for peat land, respectively. This data is likely to contribute to the low emission development in North Sumatra.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - In southeastern South America, the afforestation over grasslands imposes a severe threat to the grassy landscapes and associated biodiversity. To analyze the effect of forest plantations on grassland birds, we present a new database that considers the composition of bird communities in natural habitats, as well as in eucalyptus plantations from the southeastern South American grasslands. Data were previously used to investigate the effectiveness of legally protected grasslands in private lands to protect birds in "Bird-grassland associations in protected and non-protected areas in the southern Brazil" [1] and also the effects of afforestation of grasslands on different dimensions of bird diversity in "The effects of grassland ecosystem afforestation on avian phylogenetic diversity, taxonomic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness" [2]. Data were collected during the breeding period of bird species (spring/austral summer), covering three breeding seasons during the years 2014-2016. Species presence and number of individuals were recorded, totaling 107 species and 1175 individuals. The dataset will be useful for researchers interested in conservation studies as it includes data from globally threatened bird species. (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For programs that aim to promote forest conservation and poverty alleviation, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the participation of indigenous communities is essential to meet program goals. Using Ostrom's theory of collective action for common pool resource management, we evaluated the institutions governing indigenous participation in the Programa Socio Bosque incentive-based conservation program in Ecuador. We conducted structured interviews with 94 members in 4 communities to assess community institutions for 6 of Ostrom's principles, using 12 measures we developed for the principles. We found substantial variation between communities in terms of their institutional performance. The best-performing community performed well (>50% of interviewees reported successfully meeting the measure) on 8 of the 12 measures. The weakest performed well on only 2 out of 12 measures. Overall, our results indicate that there is stronger performance for constitutional-level institutions, which determine who gets to make the rules, and some collective-choice institutions, which determine how local rules are made. We identified specific challenges with the day-to-day operational institutions that arise from participation in nation state-community conservation programs, such as restricted resource appropriation, monitoring and compliance, and conflict resolution. We found that top-down policy making has an important role to play in supporting communities to establish constitutional-level and some collective-choice institutions. However, developing operational institutions may take more time and depend on local families' day-to-day use of resources, and thus may require a more nuanced policy approach. As some countries and donors find a jurisdictional REDD+ approach increasingly attractive, complementing top-down policy measures with bottom-up institutional development could provide a stronger platform to achieve the shift from current land use driving deforestation to a lower-carbon-emissions land management trajectory.

TI  - THE ALIEN STREET TREES OF FORTALEZA (NE BRAZIL): QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS AND THE INVENTORY OF TWO DISTRICTS
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Public tree planting is important for cities. It produces shadow, brings well-being for humans, and supports the urban fauna. But the cultivation of exotic plants can also be responsible for dissemination of invasive species. This paper aims to evaluate public tree planting in Fortaleza, Ceara state, in northeastern Brazil. From 2005 to 2009, qualitative observations on tree composition in the city were made. In 2006, a detailed inventory of all public trees was carried out in two districts of Fortaleza. Jointly, 2075 individuals grew here. Most of the tree species planted in Fortaleza are aliens, some are even invasive. The massive use of exotic plants in Fortaleza has negative consequences for the environmental education. People do not know the regional native trees, and thus are not concerned about the local biodiversity conservation. In spite of the huge amounts of native species available for ornamental purposes in the Brazilian flora, the street trees of Fortaleza are overwhelmingly aliens.

TI  - Are national commitments to reducing emissions from forests effective? Lessons from Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For Indonesia to achieve its greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments, it will have to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and peatland degradation. The National Action Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions was Indonesia's first comprehensive plan. It reflected Indonesia's emission reduction commitments to 2020, and the first phase ran from 2010 to 2014. This research evaluates its design and implementation. It assesses seven out of thirteen actions that were implemented to reduce emissions from forestry and peatland degradation. It is shown that only two actions had a direct, evidence-based link to emission sources. Three actions had some evidence of a link, albeit dependent on many factors. For the remaining two actions, focused on emissions from agriculture in peatland, there was no information to demonstrate clear and targeted implementation of the actions. The analysis also shows that the indicators listed in the National Action Plan were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful reductions of emissions. Part of the explanation for the problematic design of the actions is that many of them were pre-existing policies, aimed at achieving a variety of different objectives that were just rebadged as climate change actions.

TI  - Rapid Response of Bird Communities to Small-Scale Reforestation in Indonesian Borneo.
T2  - Tropical Conservation Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Borneo suffers from one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, primarily due to agriculture, logging, and other human activities. This habitat loss may be partly mitigated by reforestation programs in degraded landscapes, especially anthropogenic grasslands that have little conservation or economic value. By monitoring native bird communities, we evaluated the success of two small (<20 ha) community reforestation projects in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. Birds responded rapidly following reforestation, with species richness doubling over 7 years at one site, and increasing by 29% in just 3 years at the other Final tallies (63-70 species per site) were comparable to those obtained in older secondary forests elsewhere in Borneo. Anthropogenic fire is the primary threat to reforestation success, but intensive fire prevention allows bird communities to recover from temporary setbacks. Absence of fire was thus the most important factor in recovery, and we detected no effect of replanted area on bird species richness. Our results suggest that by engaging local communities and ensuring long-term maintenance, even small reforestation sites in Borneo can provide immediate benefits for native biodiversity.

TI  - Responding to climate change and the global land crisis: REDD+, market transformation and low-emissions rural development
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change and rapidly escalating global demand for food, fuel, fibre and feed present seemingly contradictory challenges to humanity. Can greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use, more than one-fourth of the global total, decline as growth in land-based production accelerates? This review examines the status of two major international initiatives that are designed to address different aspects of this challenge. REDD+ is an emerging policy framework for providing incentives to tropical nations and states that reduce their GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Market transformation, best represented by agricultural commodity roundtables, seeks to exclude unsustainable farmers from commodity markets through international social and environmental standards for farmers and processors. These global initiatives could potentially become synergistically integrated through (i) a shared approach for measuring and favouring high environmental and social performance of land use across entire jurisdictions and (ii) stronger links with the domestic policies, finance and laws in the jurisdictions where agricultural expansion is moving into forests. To achieve scale, the principles of REDD+ and sustainable farming systems must be embedded in domestic low-emission rural development models capable of garnering support across multiple constituencies. We illustrate this potential with the case of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Sources of soil organic carbon under Eucalyptus silvopastures and other land-use systems in Brazilian Oxisols
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) incorporating non-native tree species such as Eucalyptus are increasingly being adopted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall delta 13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and <53 mu m) and analyzed for delta 13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha(-1)). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the "native" SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests.

TI  - Prioritization of target areas for rehabilitation: A case study from West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To rehabilitate degraded forestlands and conserve the remaining forests in Kalimantan, effective measures are needed that accommodate various land uses in the landscape. We present a pragmatic model for prioritizing target areas for rehabilitation and discuss a potential approach, combining traditional reforestation and the forest management methods of local Dayak tribes with the operations of a commercial tree plantation venture, to promote the rehabilitation of elements of the tropical lowland rainforest. We characterized the vegetation and land use in the study area and assume that rehabilitation and conservation value will be maximized by concentrating rehabilitation efforts around forest patches with high cultural and economic value to the local Dayaks. We simulated potential enlargement of these culturally important forests and built a model to calculate a rehabilitation value for each forest fragment and fragment group with easily measurable criteria of vegetation and area. The model gives priority to areas where large continuous areas of culturally important forests already exist and/or will be created. The individual culturally important forest patches and their total area in the landscape are small, but even a small potential enlargement may be enough to establish relatively large concentrations. The potential matrix area for rehabilitation is dominated by young successional woody vegetation. Forested areas, although heavily degraded, connect several culturally important forest concentrations and are the most desirable target for rehabilitation. A well-managed commercial tree plantation can enhance conditions for the protection and rehabilitation of degraded forestlands through traditional reforestation and forest management methods.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of livestock as a means to achieve forest conservation and food production in the Brazilian Southern Atlantic forest
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot. Efforts to restore the forest must address the tradeoffs facing family farmers. In this paper, we combine literature review and empirical analysis to evaluate the ways in which an agroecological practice - Management Intensive Grazing (MIG) - can contribute to sustainable intensification in southern Brazil. Our results show that farmers adopting MIG obtained, in general, better economic and environmental performance, but did not completely renounce the use of external inputs. Forest cover appears to have increased since the promotion of MIG and agroecology in the region and pasture area decreased, therefore, benefiting forest conservation.

TI  - Global Tree Cover and Biomass Carbon on Agricultural Land: The contribution of agroforestry to global and national carbon budgets
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems and tree cover on agricultural land make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha(-1). Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases.

TI  - An optimized policy for the reduction of CO2 emission in the Brazilian Legal Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian government has already acknowledged the importance of investing in the development and application of technologies to reduce or prevent CO2 emissions resulting from human activities in the Legal Brazilian Amazon (BA). The BA corresponds to a total area of 5 x 10(6) km(2) from which 4 x 10(6) km(2) was originally covered by the rain forest. One way to interfere with the net balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is to increase the forest area to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. The single most important cause of depletion of the rain forest is cattle ranching. In this work, we present an effective policy to reduce the net balance of CO2 emissions using optimal control theory to obtain a compromising partition of investments in reforestation and promotion of clear technology to achieve a CO2 emission target for 2020. The simulation indicates that a CO2 emission target for 2020 of 376 million tonnes requires an estimated forest area by 2020 of 3,708,000 km(2), demanding a reforestation of 454,037 km(2). Even though the regional economic growth can foster the necessary political environment for the commitment with optimal emission targets, the reduction of 38.9% of carbon emissions until 2020 proposed by Brazilian government seems too ambitious.

AB  - Crop production and environmental sustainability were threatened by environmental issues such as global warming, climate change and land degradation. Rice is a staple food of more than half of the world's population and the most important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Rice production accounted for 36% of total emissions from agriculture. The use of organic material management in paddy fields is a potential to support sustainable agriculture. Biochar is reported to enhance soil carbon sequestration and soil productivity. This study aimed to know the effect of combined compost with biochar application on rice yields and greenhouse gas emissions in minted rice fields. The research was conducted for 3 years at research station of Indonesian Agricultural Environment Research Institute, Pati-Central Java. CH4 and N2O emissions were measured using close chamber method. We used combined compost with rice husk biochar for organic fertilizer, namely Biocompost. The results of this study indicated that the application of combined compost with biochar in each planting season improved the grain yield by 17% and reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 5% compared to conventional practice. The combined compost with biochar application in paddy fields has the opportunity as GHG mitigation efforts on rice production.

AB  - Traditional agroforestry practices in Berau, East Kalimantan, are suitable land use types to conserve that potentially support the implementation of REDD+. The objectives of this research are to assess biodiversity and carbon stock in various traditional agroforestry practices, also to determine the accuracy of the ability levels of local community in biodiversity and carbon stock monitoring. This paper presents the implementation plan and preliminary data in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu, in Berau district. Professional forester-led methods of biodiversity and carbon stock assessment follow the recommended procedures, while training component are carried out using different method in order to test the accuracy of monitoring level. First round of data collection in both villages identified main fruit trees, locally known as langsat, in Kampung Birang, while different durian were found in Kampung Merabu. Field observation showed that the total time taken for completing the monitoring work has declined in line with the work cycle progress supported by willingness of community to participate in the monitoring program.

T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic residues management (ORM) alter plant traits and soil properties by changing nutrient and carbon cycling. It is unclear how ORM (mulching, compost, and their combination) applied for 18 months creates a mechanism to promote changes in a P. pyrifolia field. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of ORM on P. pyrifolia nutritional status, plant traits, yield, and carbon sequestration in a 16-year subtropical P. pyrifolia field. For this purpose, we performed an experiment in a randomized block design, using a factorial scheme 2 x 2, with the use of Compost and Mulching (e.g., presence and absence). The highest values of leaves N content, plant height, stem biomass, root biomass, total biomass, yield, and above- and belowground carbon (C) density were found on plots that received compost as the ORM. For soil organic C stock, the highest values were found on plots where mulching was applied. Finally, the highest values of total C density were found on plots that received the combination of Mulching and Compost. Our findings suggest that: (i) the use of Compost is the best alternative to promote leaves N content, plant height, stem dry biomass, root dry biomass, and total dry biomass, plant yield, and above- and belowground C density into a 16-year P. pyrifolia field into subtropical conditions; and (ii) the soil organic C stocks were improved using just the mulching treatment. The results highlight the importance of considering just one organic residue practice based on a sustainable way to improve both plant production and carbon sequestration, no differences were found between the use of compost and the combination of compost and mulching.

TI  - Forest protection and permanence of reduced emissions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are essential for climate change mitigation. With growing interest over the use of credits from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and other natural climate solutions within both voluntary and compliance carbon markets, key concerns about the long-term durability of the reductions, or their permanence, arise for countries, corporations, regulators, and policy makers. This paper seeks to analyze the longevity of emissions reductions from different policies to slow down and stop deforestation. To establish conditions of permanence, we conduct numerical analyses using a model based on a cellular automata algorithm that learns from historical deforestation patterns and other spatial features in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. First, we simulate increased law enforcement to curb deforestation at a jurisdictional scale from 2025 to 2034, followed by potential policy rollbacks from 2035 to 2050. Second, we consider alternative scenarios to avoid potentially legal deforestation coupled with reforestation. We find spatial and path dependence - a successful policy intervention may permanently change the deforestation trajectory even after potential policy reversals. Hence, permanence depends both on the probability of policy reversals and the risk of emissions overshooting. Our results are important for advancing the understanding around the unsettled debate on the permanence of avoided emissions. Further, this paper argues that as policies to prevent deforestation or reduce emissions otherwise are reversible, permanence should be understood and discussed in a probabilistic and time-dependent framework.

TI  - A bioeconomic analysis of carbon sequestration in farm forestry:: a simulation study of Gliricidia sepium
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees provide many environmental services including improved soil fertility and soil structure, which often leads to increased productivity and sustainability of the land. Trees also increase the average carbon stocks of land-use systems. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, landholders may receive payments for the carbon-sequestration services provided. This study is the first of a series aimed at assessing the appropriateness of tree-based land-use systems as alternatives to continuous cropping and/or Imperata-fallow systems. The performance of a Gliricidia sepium woodlot, grown over 25 years and under various pruning and harvesting regimes, was assessed through modelling. The assessment was based on the system's ability to sequester and store carbon, maintain land productivity, and be financially pro. table for landholders. It was found that the system was pro. table under most management regimes tested. Profits were maximised by pruning and harvesting as much biomass as possible when no carbon payments were available, but this strategy decreased system productivity and profitability in the long run. Carbon-sequestration payments encouraged landholders to adopt less intensive practices since net revenues were higher with carbon payments. It was also shown that the carbon pools included in a carbon-trading scheme were sensitive to carbon-measuring costs. For example, if the annual cost of measuring soil carbon was greater than US$1.19 ha(-1) it would not be economical to account for this pool in a carbon-sequestration project.

TI  - Mapping aboveground biomass in Indonesian lowland forests using GEDI and hierarchical models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions.

TI  - Effects of silvicultural intensification on timber yields, carbon dynamics, and tree species composition in a dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia: An individual-tree-based model simulation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature conservation through sustainable forest management is challenged in the tropics by unnecessarily destructive but selective logging and diminishing timber yields. Silvicultural treatments beyond reduced impact logging are often recommended to increase timber stocking, tree growth, and profits. Despite lack of large-scale and long-term scientific support, Indonesia has embarked on large-scale silvicultural intensification, To fill this information gap, we assessed the timber, carbon, and tree species composition consequences of different silvicultural practices in dipterocarp forests in Kalimantan, Indonesia.With data from 30 1-ha sample plots monitored for up to 20 years after silvicultural intervention coupled with a new forest growth and yield model simulation (SILFOR), we evaluated the long-term consequences of the following silvicultural practices: once logged with a minimum cutting diameter (MCD) of 60 cm (L60); once logged followed by under-planting with seedlings of commercial timber species (L6OUP); twice logged with MCDs of 60 cm and then 40 cm (L60L40); and, twice logged followed by strip planting along cleared lines (L60L4OSP).The results indicate that timber yields will not be sustained by L60 or L60L40 even if cutting cycles are extended from the current minimum of 30 years to 60 years. In contrast, yields from enrichment planted logged-over forests will recover to levels higher than the first cut if cutting cycles are extended to 50 years for 1.60UP and to 40 years for L60L4OSP. Under these intensive silvicultural regimes, biomass carbon stocks also recover to primary forests levels, but with increased representation of commercial species. Although silviculturally successful, the financial consequences of these approaches to management intensification remain to be scrutinized. ( C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cropping systems, carbon sequestration and erosion in Brazil, a review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils represent a large carbon pool, approximately 1500 Gt, which is equivalent to almost three times the quantity stored in terrestrial biomass and twice the amount stored in the atmosphere. Any modification of land use or land management can induce variations in soil carbon stocks, even in agricultural systems that are perceived to be in a steady state. Tillage practices often induce soil aerobic conditions that are favourable to microbial activity and may lead to a degradation of soil structure. As a result, mineralisation of soil organic matter increases in the long term. The adoption of no-tillage systems and the maintenance of a permanent vegetation cover using Direct seeding Mulch-based Cropping system or DMC, may increase carbon levels in the topsoil. In Brazil, no-tillage practices (mainly DMC), were introduced approximately 30 years ago in the south in the Parana state, primarily as a means of reducing erosion. Subsequently, research has begun to study the management of the crop waste products and their effects on soil fertility, either in terms of phosphorus management, as a means of controlling soil acidity, or determining how manures can be applied in a more localised manner. The spread of no-till in Brazil has involved a large amount of extension work. The area under no-tillage is still increasing in the centre and north of the country and currently occupies ca. 20 million hectares, covering a diversity of environmental conditions, cropping systems and management practices. Most studies of Brazilian soils give rates of carbon storage in the top 40 cm of the soil of 0.4 to 1.7 t C ha(-1) per year, with the highest rates in the Cerrado region. However, caution must be taken when analysing DMC systems in terms of carbon sequestration. Comparisons should include changes in trace gas fluxes and should not be limited to a consideration of carbon storage in the soil alone if the full implications for global warming are to be assessed.

TI  - Seed bank in reforestation, edge and interior of seasonal semi-deciduous forest renmant in southern Brazil
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE BOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to compare the composition of the seed bank in the seasonal semi-deciduous forest remnant and in the adjacent reforestation, 60 soil samples were collected in four transects allocated in the forest interior (TIF), forest edge (TBF), reforestation edge (TBR) and reforestation interior (TIR). These samples were kept in greenhouse and monitored for eight months. The seed bank was registered according to the seedling emergence method. TIF presented the greatest richness of trees, while in the other transects there was a predominance of herbaceous and anemochorous species. We observed the occurrence of exotic species in the bank. The low richness of tree species in the reforestation seed bank, despite its proximity to a conserved fragment, suggests that management actions should be evaluated and implemented in order to accelerate the successional process.

TI  - Allometric equation for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) to support REDD
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important aspects to support the success of REDD+ programme is the availability of a standard methodology and method to estimate carbon stock in forest or agroforestry land, which is recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to describe and discuss a method to estimate the carbon stocks in agroforestry land in Hutumury Village, Ambon. The formulation of allometric equation for nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) is used to predict the aboveground biomass of nutmeg-based agroforestry land. The carbon mass equation model was constructed based on a significant relationship between carbon mass of nutmeg tree and its diameters at breast height and tree height. In order to analyse the biomass content, a destructive sampling technique was used. After felling, dimensional measurement was performed for each tree. The results of the study showed that the equation model for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg tree was allometric equation of Power, i.e., Y=134.353*(D**2.424) or ln (Y)=ln (134.353)+(2.424*ln (D)) with R-2 (adj)=0.977 and standard error (SE)=0.183. This allometric equation is a local allometric model and much needed to support REDD+ especially in Maluku Province. In addition, aboveground biomass predictors are easy to determine as only stem diameters are required to be measured mainly in dense forests.

T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements to forest and land governance are key to addressing deforestation and degradation of peatlands in Indonesia. While this is a priority area, the steps to achieving good forest and land governance have been under researched. There is a need for better links between theoretically informed academic analysis and work in the field. This study drew together a panel of experts on forest and land governance using a Delphi method to discuss the underlying drivers of deforestation and peatland degradation, and correspondingly, to identify interventions to improve land and forest governance in Indonesia. Seventeen panelists with an average of more than 12 years' experience reached agreement over four governance interventions: increasing the capacity of local communities to manage and monitor forests and natural resources (65% of panelist's votes); identify strengths and weaknesses of community organisations and institutions, and develop strategies to improve their performance (65% of panelist's votes); gazetting forests to clarify land boundaries and determine which areas should be village, community and state forest zone (59% of panelist's votes); and, integrating participatory community maps into spatial plans to protect local communities and indigenous peoples' development needs (53% of panelist's votes). They also supported action research involving the government, private sector and communities, and political economy approaches to researching forest and land governance issues. Panelists indicated that community level approaches such as securing community forest tenure through clarifying land claims and integrating local land tenure into spatial planning had an important role in sustainable forest management.

TI  - The need for a consistent fire policy for Cerrado conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is a fire-dependent savanna requiring a clear and urgent fire management policy. The extensive misuse of fire for deforestation or pasture management in Brazil has created an overall perception that its use is always deleterious. This view, reinforced by threats of global warming and climatic change, has lead to current policies of fire suppression.2. Cerrado ecosystems depend on the historical fire regime to maintain their structure, biodiversity and functioning. The suppression of fire has transformed savanna vegetation into forests, causing biodiversity losses and drastic changes in ecological processes.3. Policy implications. The National Fire Policy required by law must be urgently implemented in Brazil, including use of fire for Cerrado conservation in public and private lands on the basis of existing knowledge of indigenous people and scientists. Objective regulations on prescribed burning, land manager training, incentives for fire research and experimentation and a broad campaign to disseminate the benefits of fire for Cerrado conservation should be the cornerstones of the policy. If implemented, the policy can give the biodiversity of the Cerrado a future that has previously been severely threatened by fire suppression.

TI  - The Denser Canopy of Mangrove Drives the Structure of Insect Communities
T2  - TROPICAL LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration in Trenggalek, East Java has resulted an age variation of mangrove ecosystem. Diverse species of insects predominantly found in mangroves were collected using yellow pan traps, swipe nets and by direct picking from three different sites. This research was conducted from April until August 2015. There are 9,181 individual insects associated with mangroves comprised of 42 species from 31 families and eight orders. The first site or the 15 years old mangrove (66.22% canopy cover) indicated the highest Shannon diversity index at 2.54, Evenness index of 0.32 and Margalef richness index of 4.84. The lowest diversity was recorded in the third site or the five years old mangrove (19.65% canopy cover), with the Shannon diversity index at 2.28, Evenness index at 0.26 and Margalef richness index at 4.59. The most abundant species located was the Eristena mangalis, with 1,724 individuals (relative abundance of 18.78%), followed by Monolepta sp. with 1,649 individuals (relative abundance of 17.96%). These are the phytophagous insects associated with mangrove leaves. This study concluded that the older mangrove ecosystem have a denser canopy that supports insect life.

TI  - Ghg mitigation potential and cost in tropical forestry - Relative role for agroforestry
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes studies of carbon mitigation potential (MP) and costs of forestry options in seven developing countries with a focus on the role of agroforestry. A common methodological approach known as comprehensive mitigation assessment process (COMAP) was used in each study to estimate the potential and costs between 2000 and 2030. The approach requires the projection of baseline and mitigation land-use scenarios derived from the demand for forest products and forestland for other uses such as agriculture and pasture. By using data on estimated carbon sequestration, emission avoidance, costs and benefits, the model enables one to estimate cost effectiveness indicators based on monetary benefit pert C, as well as estimates of total mitigation costs and potential when the activities are implemented at equilibrium level. The results show that about half the MP of 6.9 Gt C (an average of 223 Mt C per year) between 2000 and 2030 in the seven countries could be achieved at a negative cost, and the other half at costs not exceeding dollar sign100 pert C. Negative cost indicates that non-carbon revenue is sufficient to offset direct costs of about half of the options. The agroforestry options analyzed bear a significant proportion of the potential at medium to low cost pert C when compared to other options. The role of agroforestry in these countries varied between 6% and 21% of the MP, though the options are much more cost effective than most due to the low wage or opportunity cost of rural labor. Agroforestry options are attractive due to the large number of people and potential area currently engaged in agriculture, but they pose unique challenges for carbon and cost accounting due to the dispersed nature of agricultural activities in the tropics, as well as specific difficulties arising from requirements for monitoring, verification, leakage assessment and the establishment of credible baselines.

TI  - No evidence of local deforestation leakage from protected areas establishment in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing Protected areas (PAs) could displace or cause 'leakage' of deforestation into adjacent areas. Such leakage would potentially offset PAs' conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation -REDD+. Here we investigate forest loss inside PAs' borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new PAs (n = 425) within the Amazon and the Atlantic forests in Brazil between 2004 and 2017. We applied a Before -After-Control-Intervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from PAs' establishment using a spatial (inside and outside PAs)- temporal (before and after PA establishment) measure of deforestation rates. We also used "Random Forest " to investigate the drivers of the effect of PAs' establishment on their surrounding areas. We found that when PAs' establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries, their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation ( "blockage "). Similarly, when PAs' establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries, their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation. Such a pattern was most common for Indigenous territories, especially in the deforestation arch in the Amazon. However, we did not find significant evidence for leakage as PAs' surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with PAs unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries. Therefore, "leakage " should not limit the establishment of new PAs. Instead, greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing PAs, with high priority given to Indigenous Territories.

TI  - Impacts of rattan cane harvesting on vegetation structure and tree diversity of Conservation Forest in Buton, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lambusango Forest, Buton, Indonesia, is an example of the potential for conflict between forest conservation and long standing local extraction of Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs), in this case rattan cane harvesting. This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale NTFP extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation.

TI  - Charcoal Fine Residues Effects on Soil Organic Matter Humic Substances, Composition, and Biodegradability
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar has been shown as a potential mean to enhance carbon sequestration in the soil. In Brazil, approximately 15% of the produced charcoal is discarded as charcoal fines, which are chemically similar to biochar. Therefore, we aimed to test charcoal fines as a strategy to increase soil carbon sequestration. Charcoal fines of hardwood Mimosa scabrella were incorporated into a Cambisol down to 10 cm (T1 = 0 and T4 = 40 Mg ha(-1)) in Southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0-30 cm) 20 months after charcoal amendment. Soil organic matter (SOM) acid extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions were separated. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from charcoal and SOM in T1 and T4 were obtained before and after 165 days of incubation under controlled conditions. Charcoal increased soil carbon as fulvic (10-20 cm) and humic acids (10-30 cm) and, especially, as humin (0-5 cm), which probably occurred due to the hydrophobic character of the charcoal. The C-13 NMR spectra and mean residence times (MRT) measured from incubation essays indicated that the charred material decomposed relatively fast and MRT of T1 and T4 samples were similar. It follows that the charcoal fines underwent similar decomposition as SOM, despite the high charcoal dose applied to the soil and the high aryl C contribution (78%) to the total C-13 intensity of the charcoal NMR spectra.

TI  - The carbon stock potential of the restored mangrove ecosystem of Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can absorb significant amounts of carbon and help mitigate climate change. However, their existence continues to be endangered by natural and human forces. Therefore, mangrove restoration is regarded as a crucial component of the global climate change agenda. This study aims to estimate the potential total carbon stock of restored mangrove ecosystems in Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java. The above-below ground (root) carbon stock was calculated using several published allometric equations. The loss-on-ignition method analyzed leaf litter and sediment carbon stocks. This study estimates the Pasarbanggi mangrove ecosystem's total carbon stock potential at 0.02 x 106 MgC, which is equivalent to the potential CO2 emission of 0.08 x 106 MgCO2e, with up to 65% stored in sediments. This study highlights the critical role of restored mangrove ecosystems on the climate change mitigation agenda by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Plantation forests and biodiversity: oxymoron or opportunity?
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Losses of natural and semi-natural forests, mostly to agriculture, are a significant concern for biodiversity. Against this trend, the area of intensively managed plantation forests increases, and there is much debate about the implications for biodiversity. We provide a comprehensive review of the function of plantation forests as habitat compared with other land cover, examine the effects on biodiversity at the landscape scale, and synthesise context-specific effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity. Natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests but there is abundant evidence that plantation forests can provide valuable habitat, even for some threatened and endangered species, and may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by various mechanisms. In landscapes where forest is the natural land cover, plantation forests may represent a low-contrast matrix, and afforestation of agricultural land can assist conservation by providing complementary forest habitat, buffering edge effects, and increasing connectivity. In contrast, conversion of natural forests and afforestation of natural non-forest land is detrimental. However, regional deforestation pressure for agricultural development may render plantation forestry a 'lesser evil' if forest managers protect indigenous vegetation remnants. We provide numerous context-specific examples and case studies to assist impact assessments of plantation forestry, and we offer a range of management recommendations. This paper also serves as an introduction and background paper to this special issue on the effects of plantation forests on biodiversity.

TI  - Fire management in the Brazilian savanna: First steps and the way forward
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Several decades of frustrated attempts to prevent fires in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) have led to deleterious ecological and management consequences. In 2014, the first Integrated Fire Management (IFM) programme was launched in three protected areas (PAs).2. The IFM programme considers local practices, ecological information, management options and aims to create landscape mosaics of different fire histories to conserve biodiversity, reduce the prevalence of late-dry season (LDS) wildfires, protect fire-sensitive vegetation and reduce conflicts between PA managers and local communities.3. The first 3years of imposed fire management regimes led to 40%-57% reduction in LDS fires, improved dialogue between researchers, managers and local communities, generating fire management learning communities.

TI  - In the Shadow of Trees: Does Eucalyptus Afforestation Reduce Herpetofaunal Diversity in Southern Brazil?
T2  - SOUTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cultivation is widely stimulated due to the provision of environmental services by sequestering atmospheric carbon, but forestry is a potential danger to biodiversity, mainly when cultivation replaces originally non-forested landscapes. Due to the rapid expansion of afforestation in grassland ecosystems, we used environmental descriptors and structure of amphibian and reptile communities as a tool to assess the possible effects of forestry on wildlife. We used pitfall traps with drift fences in Eucalyptus afforestation and native grasslands of the Pampa biome from southern Brazil. Amphibians and reptile species richness was lower in afforestation than in native grasslands. Furthermore, the reptile community found in afforestation was a poor subset of the community recorded in native grasslands. Indeed, the structure of communities for both amphibians and reptiles in afforestation was highly dissimilar from the native grasslands, with major environmental descriptors that influenced this difference being related to the structure of undergrowth vegetation, incident light, and sodium concentration in soil. Amphibians and reptiles proved to be an efficient tool to assess the potential impacts effects of afforestation/forestation since the replacement of natural grassland ecosystems by eucalypt afforestation caused detectable negative effects on the diversity of herpetofauna. Biodiversity conservation strategies in non-forest ecosystems are urgently needed and should encompass policies to restrict the expansion of forestry on the remaining native grasslands.

TI  - An Assessment of the Site-Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM) Strategy for Irrigated Rice in Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) strategy provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice (Oryza sativa) production. The SSNM fertilizer recommendations are based on the yield goal approach, which has been frequently cited in empirical studies. This study evaluates the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice-producing countries around the world, including India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explore whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). The results suggest the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites-some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. The SOM also significantly affects the nitrogen fertilizer uptake. I conclude by suggesting that the SSNM strategy can be made to be more adaptive to farmer's fields if these relationships are accounted for in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm.

TI  - Wildlife Species Recorded by Camera Traps in Reforested Lowland Rainforest and Peat Swamp Forest of Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesia
T2  - Tropical Natural History
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified wildlife presence in two reforestation areas of Gunung Palung National Park (GPNP), one of the top biodiversity hotspots in Indonesian Borneo. Wildlife species were monitored using camera traps in two reforested ecosystems: lowland dipterocarp forest and peat swamp forest. The GPNP authority and the non -profit organization Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI), in affiliation with the non -profit organization Health in Harmony (HIH), have conducted reforestation in the lowland dipterocarp forest since 2009 and the peat swamp forest since 2012. Cameras were placed at 13 locations from December 2020 to August 2022 using point and grid methods. Fortyseven wildlife species were recorded, including mammals (31 species), birds (14 species), and reptiles (2 species). Eighteen of these species are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The wildlife documented in this study indicate that a reforestation approach emphasizing community engagement, long -term partnerships, and ecosystem functioning can support the restoration of heavily degraded lowland rainforest and peat swamp forest to viable habitat.

TI  - Strategic Analysis of the Forest Carbon Market in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest carbon market in Brazil presents a complex scenario filled with challenges and opportunities. This study employed SWOT analysis to evaluate the dynamics of this market, based on the perceptions of 77 specialists from various professional fields. The analysis revealed that extensive forest cover and biodiversity preservation are significant strengths that position Brazil as a potential leader in the global carbon credit market. However, weaknesses such as illegal deforestation and fragile public policies undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Opportunities include the growing international demand for carbon credits and the recognition of the importance of local communities in forest conservation. Nevertheless, external threats like land conflicts and political instability pose considerable risks. The study concludes that it is crucial to strengthen public policies and regulatory frameworks, promote technological innovation, and ensure the active inclusion of local and indigenous communities to guarantee the sustainability and growth of Brazil's forest carbon market. The research suggests that despite significant challenges, Brazil can overcome these obstacles with the implementation of effective strategies.

TI  - Is mangrove planting insufficient for benthic macrofaunal recovery when environmental stress is persistent?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove restoration or rehabilitation is usually based on planting native or exotic species and these actions rarely result in a return to the natural variability of biological assemblage structures and functions that is self-sustaining. One of the major causes of this failure is not attempting to remove stressors that limit natural ecosystem processes (i.e., in mangroves, any act that disturbs the hydroperiod, input of resources, or constrains regulators) in the framework for restoration. Despite this scientific consensus, this has not been put into practice. Here, we analysed a field experiment carried out over 12 years ago, to compare three planted and three reference mangrove stands (natural and previously undisturbed), with no attempt to remove the various causes of disturbance. Forest structure and productivity, sediment features, pollutants, and benthic macrofauna, which are all equally adapted to the mangroves natural conditions and are sensitive to physical disturbances and pollution, were assessed. Values for all environmental variables and almost all species and trophic groups densities differed between planted and reference sites. The fauna in planted areas was qualitatively the same as that in the reference areas, but the assemblages reflected environmental stressors, mainly pollutants (trace metals and nutrients) in the sediment and also hydroperiod alterations (differences in elevation), but not forest structure or functioning. The results indicate that: (i) forest structure and productivity in planted areas were not as would be expected for a time frame of 12 years; (ii) even with constant potential recolonisation of species from surrounding reference areas, planting alone was not sufficient for ecosystem and benthic macro faunal recovery. We recommend that ecological engineering follows the best practice available to restore mangrove ecosystems by removing the environmental stressors, establishing natural topography, and assessing the long-term success of the projects.

TI  - Effect of sugarcane residue management (mulching versus burning) on organic matter in a clayey Oxisol from southern Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in residue management may help sustain land productivity, and may have noticeable consequences in the global carbon budget when large areas are involved. The effects of sugarcane residue management on topsoil carbon were assessed in a clayey Oxisol of Brazil, largest world's producer of sugarcane. The carbon concentration of the whole soil and particle-size fractions were determined in a long-duration sugarcane plantation (50 years), with either a pre-harvest residue burning (BUR) or a 6-year green trash management (MUL, residue mulching). Soil carbon concentrations were greater in MUL than in BUR. The difference was significant at a 0-5 cm depth (25.2 versus 21.0 g C kg(-1)) but not at 5-10 cm (22.3 versus 20.5 g C kg(-1)); nevertheless it was significant at 0-10 cm (23.7 versus 20.7 g C kg(-1)). This difference resulted in carbon sequestration in MUL, which arnounted to 0.65 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at 0-10 cm depth and corresponded to 14% of aboveground residue carbon returned to the soil. Differences in soil carbon between MUL and BUR mainly affected the fraction < 2 mu m. It was hypothesized that the preferential enrichment in fine fractions resulted in a long-term carbon storage.

TI  - Forest transitions, trade, and the global displacement of land use
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing tropical deforestation is an international priority, given its impacts on carbon emissions and biodiversity. We examined whether recent forest transitions-a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation-involved a geographic displacement of forest clearing across countries through trade in agricultural and forest products. In most of the seven developing countries that recently experienced a forest transition, displacement of land use abroad accompanied local reforestation. Additional global land-use change embodied in their net wood trade offset 74% of their total reforested area. Because the reforesting countries continued to export more agricultural goods than they imported, this net displacement offset 22% of their total reforested area when both agriculture and forestry sectors are included. However, this net displacement increased to 52% during the last 5 y. These countries thus have contributed to a net global reforestation and/or decrease in the pressure on forests, but this global environmental benefit has been shrinking during recent years. The net decrease in the pressure on forests does not account for differences in their ecological quality. Assessments of the impacts of international policies aimed at reducing global deforestation should integrate international trade in agricultural and forest commodities.

TI  - Eudaimonia in the Amazon: Relational Values as a Deep Leverage Point to Curb Tropical Deforestation
T2  - CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation has been recognized as a major and multi-faceted sustainability issue, frequently analyzed in terms of its economic drivers, the effectiveness of protection policies, or broader political dynamics. Meanwhile, the role of values as underlying social factors affecting land-use choices remains underexplored. Recognizing that values can, however, be important "deep" leverage points for transformative change, we delve into that dimension using the Brazilian Amazon as a case study. Through a total of 72 key-informant interviews and field visits to 25 sustainable land-use initiatives in the states of Acre and Mato Grosso, we identify values that have motivated choices for conservation in deforestation frontiers and how stakeholders articulate them. Our results reveal that different land users make economic considerations, but these are interwoven with relational values-about connections to the landscape or social relations mediated by nature. Eudaimonic values, such as increased meaningfulness, personal growth through learning and knowledge sharing, as well as a sense of contributing to the world, are shown to be key in those initiatives. These findings challenge the commonplace distinction between 'traditional' and 'modern' people, showing that relational values are relevant across the board and may deserve much more attention as leverage points.

TI  - Modeling soil organic carbon dynamics in Oxisols of Ibiruba (Brazil) with the Century Model
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - introduction of conservation practices in degraded agricultural land will generally recuperate soil quality, especially by increasing soil organic matter. This aspect of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics under distinct cropping and management systems can be conveniently analyzed with ecosystem models such as the Century Model. In this study, Century was used to simulate SOC stocks in farm fields of the Ibiruba region of north central Rio Grande do Sul state in Southern Brazil. The region, where soils are predominantly Oxisols, was originally covered with subtropical woodlands and grasslands. SOC dynamics was simulated with a general scenario developed with historical data on soil management and cropping systems beginning with the onset of agriculture in 1900. From 1993 to 2050, two contrasting scenarios based on no-tillage soil management were established: the "status quo" scenario, with crops and agricultural inputs as currently practiced in the region and the "high biomass" scenario with increased frequency of corn in the cropping system, resulting in about 80% higher biomass addition to soils. Century simulations were in close agreement with SOC stocks measured in 2005 in the Oxisols with finer texture surface horizon originally under woodlands. However, simulations in the Oxisols with loamy surface horizon under woodlands and in the grassland soils were not as accurate. SOC stock decreased from 44% to 50% in fields originally under woodland and from 20% to 27% in fields under grasslands with the introduction of intensive annual grain crops with intensive tillage and harrowing operations. The adoption of conservation practices in the 1980s led to a stabilization of SOC stocks followed by a partial recovery of native stocks. Simulations to 2050 indicate that maintaining "status quo" would allow SOC stocks to recover from 81% to 86% of the native stocks under woodland and from 80% to 91 % of the native stocks under grasslands. Adoption of a "high biomass" scenario would result in stocks from 75% to 95% of the original stocks under woodlands and from 89% to 102% in the grasslands by 2050. These simulations outcomes underline the importance of cropping system yielding higher biomass to further increase SOC content in these Oxisols. This application of the Century Model could reproduce general trends of SOC loss and recovery in the Oxisols of the Ibiruba region. Additional calibration and validation should be conducted before extensive usage of Century as a support tool for soil carbon sequestration projects in this and other regions can be recommended.

AB  - Isworo S, Oetari PS. 2022. Flora and fauna in the areas around artisanal gold mining in Selogiri Sub-district, Wonogiri, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 6600-6618. Artisanal or small-scale gold mining has devastating impacts on the environment due to negligence of the principles of good environmental management. In particular, the mining activities often involve vegetation clearing and topsoil removal, which affect the biotic elements of the mined landscape. Selogiri Sub-district, Wonogiri District, Central Java Province, has a gold mineral resource that drives many traditional mining activities that have an indirect impact on the ecosystem's species diversity and community structure. This research aimed to investigate the diversity of flora and fauna in Selogiri Sub-district by comparing the area where the artisanal gold mining occurred (the inside area) and the areas surrounding the mining (the outside area). Six groups of taxa were observed in this study, including the plant group using the plot method, avifauna (birds) using Indices Ponctuels d'Abondance method, Odonata (dragonflies) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) both using visual encountering survey (VES) method, micromammals (Rodentia) using traps, VES, and camera traps and herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) using VES method. The diversity values of each taxa group in the inside and outside area were calculated and Sorensen's Coefficient Similarity Index formula was analyzed to see the community similarity between the two areas. A total of 243 species were found, consisting of Lepidoptera (35%), flora taxa (29%), avifauna (16%), herpetofauna (9%), Odonata (7%), and mammals (3%). The avifauna and Odonata had higher diversity values in the outside area than in the inside area. Similarly, the outside area had a higher diversity value for mammalian taxa documented using the VES method. Meanwhile, using the trap method, the taxa of Lepidoptera, herpetofauna, and mammals had higher diversity value in the inside area than in the outside. Nonetheless, the two areas had moderate similarity in the composition of flora and fauna species, with a community similarity value of less than 60% for all taxa studied. Conservation activities and off-site tree planting are solutions for restoring ecosystem structure and function to support ecological stability and biodiversity.

TI  - A re-emerging Atlantic forest? Urbanization, industrialization and the forest transition in Santa Catarina, southern Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the second half of the twentieth century, southern Brazil underwent rapid industrialization and urbanization. In earlier historical periods in Europe and North America, these trends have contributed to a forest transition in which deforestation gives way to forestation. In a developing country, like Brazil, with a more skewed income distribution and a larger rural underclass, industrialization and urbanization may not give rise to a forest transition. These competing theoretical expectations were tested with data on forest cover change from the Brazilian censuses of 1970 through 1995/1996 for the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil. The analyses show forestation replacing deforestation between 1975 and 1980. An increase in the extent of planted forests close to urban areas explains the turnaround in forest cover trends. Because the planted forests contain relatively few native plant species, the expansion of these forests does not ease the biodiversity crisis. The re-emerging second Atlantic forest represents a smaller, less diverse and degraded version of the first Atlantic forest.

TI  - Growth and drought resilience of four native tree species suitable for reforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests has been a critical issue affecting climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reforestation strives to remedy this situation, yet it is futile as long as deforestation of primary forests continues. Since deforestation is partly motivated by the demand for valuable tropical wood, reforestation should focus not only on planting native tree species, but specifically on a high diversity of native tree species with high-quality wood. However, the eco-physiological information required for growing such species is limited, and their resilience to drought events is unknown.Here, we focused on four native tropical wood tree species identified as suitable for Brazil's Atlantic Forest reforestation. Growth, carbon assimilation, water-use and xylem hydraulics were studied in seedlings of the two legume species Dalbergia nigra and Plathymenia foliolosa and the two non-legume species Cariniana legalis and Zeyheria tuberculosa. Seedlings were monitored weekly for 9 consecutive weeks, three to five weeks of which under induced drought. Growth and carbon assimilation were 25-65 per cent higher in the legume vs. non-legume species. In turn, non-legume species mostly avoided the drought by stomatal closure, producing a 50 per cent higher water-use efficiency (WUE) compared with the legume species. The average water potential at 50 per cent stomatal conductivity (?(gs50)) for legume species was -2.6 MPa, whereas for non-legume species it was -0.85 MPa. Still, each species showed a unique set of responses, indicating different growth strategies under mesic and xeric conditions. Our results indicate a divergence among legume and non-legume species, driven by a trade-off between plant productivity (carbon assimilation and growth) and plant safety (stomatal regulation and WUE). All in all, the four species of juvenile potted plants demonstrated a high capacity for recovery from drought, which supports their potential role in future reforestation under climate change.

TI  - Different-aged Pinus afforestation does not support typical Atlantic Forest fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest of the southern Brazilian highlands is a biocultural mosaic of Araucaria Forest and grasslands. Despite adverse impacts on biodiversity, extensive areas are being afforested with non-native pine (Pinus spp.), triggering forest succession on areas that were previously native grasslands. The long-term effects of afforestation with these non-native trees for biodiversity conservation are still unknown. Here, we assess this issue by comparing the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in young (20 year) and old (70 year) pine plots with nearby native Araucaria Forest. Abundance and richness of butterflies were positively correlated with temperature and mean humidity only in the native forest. Abiotic conditions differed between vegetation types: there was more sunlight, and was warmer and drier in the pine afforestation plots than in the Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species composition was similar between young and old pine plots, but distinct from the native Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species abundances in native forests were more evenly distributed than in afforestation sites. In these pine sites, assemblages were dominated by small, grass-feeding satyrines, whereas old pine sites had more liana feeding biblidines, and the Araucaria Forest had more large-sized bamboo-feeding species. Our results indicate that even after 70 years of succession a non-native pine afforestation cannot support a butterfly assemblage as that found in the neighboring preserved forest. Moreover, threatened grassland specialist species have been locally extinct after only 20 years of pine afforestation. The evidence gathered here points against the use of silviculture with non-native trees in these biocultural mosaic landscapes.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration by agroforestry systems in southeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems can increase carbon sequestration, offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce the carbon footprint generated by animal production. The objective of this study was to estimate GHG emissions, the tree and grass aboveground biomass production and carbon storage in different agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems in southeastern Brazil. The number of trees required to offset these emissions were also estimated. The GHG emissions were calculated based on pre-farm (e.g. agrochemical production, storage, and transportation), and on-farm activities (e.g. fertilization and machinery operation). Aboveground tree grass biomass and carbon storage in all systems was estimated with allometric equations. GHG emissions from the agroforestry systems ranged from 2.81 to 7.98 t CO(2)e ha(-1). Carbon storage in the aboveground trees and grass biomass were 54.6, 11.4, 25.7 and 5.9 t C ha(-1), and 3.3, 3.6, 3.8 and 3.3 t C ha(-1) for systems 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The number of trees necessary to offset the emissions ranged from 17 to 44 trees ha(-1), which was lower than the total planted in the systems. Agroforestry systems sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and can help the GHG emission-reduction policy of the Brazilian government.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of land use changes by anthropic processes, spatially and temporally, is a fundamental tool to establish correlations between landscape patterns and processes and management of the buffer zone of Conservation Units. This study aimed to analyze the forest fragmentation and land use dynamics in the buffer zone of the Rio Doce State Park (PERD), located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the year 2015. Its buffer zone was delimited to a radius of 10 km, covering a total area of 128.893,36 ha. Land use classification was based on Landsat 8 image, orbit 217, point 73 and 74, and two types of ecosystems were identified: natural and anthropic. In the thematic mapping, the pressure of the anthropic use over the natural was notified, as well as the high number of forest fragments, which is a negative impact on the resilience required for the conservation of biodiversity and the local Atlantic forest. The fragments have different shapes and sizes and are distributed throughout the buffer zone of the PERD. There is a need to adopt conservation strategies, such as environmental education, reforestation techniques, recovery of degraded areas and ecological corridors. Even with a worrying current scenario, this finding makes it possible to establish an optimistic point for biodiversity conservation, associated with a tendency to reduce the forces of direct changes on natural systems.

TI  - Forest carbon stocks and fluxes in physiographic zones of India.
T2  - Carbon balance and management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.RESULTS: The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38.27% compared to ASP I.CONCLUSION: With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other BASIC countries China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation.

T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of effective biodiversity baselines is a major impairment to implement conservation plans. Hence, constructing and updating species lists provides vital information about species distribution records. The Sustainable Amazon Network (in Portuguese Rede Amazonia Sustentavel; RAS) is an interdisciplinary research initiative that aims to evaluate land-cover changes effects in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Within the scope of this project, we sampled ants and orchid bees and herein present a list of species collected in Paragominas, PA, Brazil; the most complete lists of species published to date of these groups for the eastern Amazon. We sampled these insects across several land-cover types, from undisturbed forested habitats, through varyingly disturbed forested habitats and secondary forests to production areas (silviculture, pastures and arable fields). In total we recorded 285 species of ants and 36 species of orchid bees. Species richness was higher in primary forests for both groups, followed by production areas. Orchid bees reached their highest richness in secondary forests. For orchid bees, production areas were dominated by a few hyper-dominant species, such as Eulaema nigrita. For future assessments if the aim is to make a complete inventory, we recommend the use of additional sampling methods. Finally, we expect this study can be used as a baseline for understanding the effectiveness of ongoing changes in forest conservation and land management practices and in determining conservation status for several taxa described here.

TI  - Machine Learning Model Reveals Land Use and Climate's Role in Caatinga Wildfires: Present and Future Scenarios
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, economies, and biodiversity, particularly in fire-prone regions like the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Climate mitigation by dairy intensification depends on intensive use of spared grassland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Milk and beef production cause 9% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the "global beef frontier" in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from "snapshot" carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation.

TI  - Modelling forest canopy trends with on-demand spatial simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding trends in forest canopy cover at local, national, and global scales is important for many applications, including policymaking related to forest carbon sequestration. Globally consistent land-cover data sets derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are now available for a period of more than 10years, long enough to detect trends both in deforestation and in afforestation. However, methods of modelling land-cover change normally require specialized software and expertise, limiting the availability of this information. This barrier to access can be eliminated through the use of web services that construct models on demand based on user-specified regions of interest, so that parameters are inferred from, and relevant to, local conditions. In this paper we present a proof-of-concept system for building and running spatial Markov chain models of forest-cover change on demand, and demonstrate how the on-demand approach may be implemented for similar applications.

TI  - Local Participation in REDD plus : Lessons from the Eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are concerns that local people will not be genuinely involved in initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). We analyzed local participation in the design of one REDD+ project in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, and assessed local hopes, worries and recommendations for the project through four community focus groups and interviews with 137 households at the site. Our results showed that only one-third of households interviewed (31%) had enough information about the project to describe it accurately. Of those, the majority (60%) hoped that the project would improve their incomes, followed by improving their agricultural production (33%) and helping protect forests (26%). While increasing household incomes was the dominant hope, people's recommendations revealed that they favored non-monetary forms of compensation over the direct cash payments included in the proponents' package of incentives. Their main recommendation was that the project should help improve their production systems through access to technical assistance, machinery and training, while valuing local production systems (46%). Our study highlights the need for participation that goes beyond passive consultation with local people to develop REDD+ interventions that best reflect local knowledge, land use practices and aspirations.

CL  - Forestry & Environm Res Dev & Innovat Agcy, Forest Res & Dev Ctr, Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - The conversion of peat swamp forest and peatlands is generally caused by the use of fire in land preparation, which is at risk of triggering uncontrolled forest and land fires. Even though the Indonesian government has explicitly banned the use of fire in clearing peatland for agriculture since 2014, which was stated on government regulation number 71 of 2014 concerning the protection and management of peat ecosystems, people still use fire in land preparation because it is cheap. This research investigated how do the community of Rengas Merah-Riding and Senasih Mulya-Kayu Labu, Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, adapt to the "zero burnings" policy? In-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed using tabulation and a qualitative descriptive approach The results of the study indicated that by the prohibition on the use of fire in land clearing, the community has tried to adapt it even though it cannot be fully implemented. The local communities of research site have alternative livelihoods without using fire, which is "bekarang" (fishing) (both site), developing edible bird nest (both site), and making "purun" mat crafts (only in Senasi Mulya-Kayu Labu). The results of the study are expected to be a valid promotion for local livelihoods without burning, as an element of community livelihoods revitalization within the framework of peat restoration programs.

TI  - Stocks and fractions of organic carbon in an Oxisol under different management systems
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the effects of soil management systems on the stocks and fractions of organic carbon of an Oxisol (Xantic Ferralsol), in the cerrado of the state of Piaui, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: a three-year-old conventional tillage; a three- and a five-year-old no-tillage system, using millet as cover crop; and a nine-year-old no-tillage, using millet as cover crop for seven and forage (Urochloa brizantha) for two years. A native cerrado area was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m depths for determining: total organic carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks; humic substances content; and humification index. The highest carbon contents were observed in the soil under cerrado, at 0.00-0.05 m depth, in both seasons. However, the highest stocks of carbon and nitrogen as well as the highest contents of humic substances were verified in the soil with no-tillage system for five and nine years, in both seasons, at all evaluated depths. The highest humification index was also observed in these soils, in the dry season. No-tillage associated with cover crops decreases soil organic matter mineralization, increases soil carbon stocks in depth, and favors carbon sequestration in cerrado areas of Piaui state.

TI  - Effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on lizard communities in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of human altered landscapes affects biodiversity on every continent. A fundamental goal of conservation biologists is to understand why certain species are at risk of extinction while others are able to persist in human altered landscapes. Afforestation, the conversion of unforested lands to planted forest, is rapidly altering many natural landscapes worldwide. In the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), a global biodiversity hotspot, a shortage of government incentives has the landscape riddled with abandoned plantation forests that are not subject to active restoration projects. Studies investigating the impacts of abandoned plantations on biodiversity are strikingly limited. We examine the effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on the structure of Cerrado lizard communities. We assessed changes in lizard capture, richness and equitability along cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus transects. Our results indicate abandoned Eucalyptus plantations have subsets of Cerrado species persisting with a great loss of endemic species. The cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus linear transect analysis demonstrated distance from native habitat is positively correlated with loss of biodiversity. We performed correspondence analyses to summarize the variation in species captures across different sites, habitats and pitfall array positions. These analyses depicted strong species associations between habitats and their pitfall array positions. This study is the first to show the negative impacts of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on Cerrado lizard communities, serving as a cautionary tale of Cerrado biodiversity non-resilience in abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Mitigation requires that abandoned Eucalyptus plantations are made more suitable to Cerrado lizards by implementing targeted habitat heterogeneity restoration.

TI  - Social Wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) as Indicators of Conservation Degree of Riparian Forests in Southeast Brazil
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social wasps present characteristics that allow their use as ecological indicators, but few studies using these insects in this context have been carried out over the past decade. Riparian Forests are important to manage runoff frequency and intensity and therefore a key ecosystem for water conservation in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. These forests play also a major role in the biodiversity conservation in the Southeast/Central regions of Brazil working as natural corridors and humidity hotspots. Here, we verify the potential use of social wasps as ecological indicators of habitat quality in riparian forests. Both margins of a 30 Km section of the "Rio das Mortes" were studied in the municipality of Barroso, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from October 2005 to September 2007. This area was divided into 500 m sections and sampled by active search, baited traps and point-based surveys to evaluate wasp richness and habitat specificity. Land use intensity was classified in five categories, from open-disturbed to old-secondary forests. Thirty-six species of social wasps were recorded and nests for 29 of them were found. The species indicator value analysis showed that Pseudopolybia vespiceps (IndVal=28.6; p=0.0073) and Polybia fastidiosuscula (IndVal=24.3; p=0.0146) are associated positively to the high conservation degree of the riparian forest and Mischocyttarus drewseni (IndVal=17.4; p=0.0365) was considered an indicator of the most disturbed categories.

TI  - Evaluation of forest growth and carbon stock in forestry projects by system dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the largest producers of eucalyptus that is used for manufacturing pulp and paper; this contributes directly to the issue of carbon emissions. Reforestation of eucalyptus appears as a viable alternative for mitigating these carbon emissions, leveraging their high productivity to that of other leading countries in the market, such as Finland and Sweden. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring and evaluating forest growth and quantifying wood stocks and sequestered carbon. System dynamics was used to simulate forest growth. Forest growth was modeled from eight regions with dissimilar edaphoclimatic characteristics, in the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The model was sensitive enough to the characteristics of the regions, where the difference in forest stocks was 45.1% at the end of 30 years in a harvest cycle of 7 years. It was found that the typical harvest cycle in practice by leading companies did not always yield a higher sequestered CO2 accumulated stock. By shortening the harvest cycle, it was possible to obtain a gain of up to 21.0% in the sequestered CO2 stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil Carbon Storage in Silvopasture and Related Land-Use Systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral management of fast-growing tree plantations is becoming popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). To understand the influence of such systems on soil carbon (C) storage, we studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems (LUS) on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were a native forest, a treeless pasture, 24- and 4-yr-old eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) plantations, and 15- and 4-yr-old silvopastures of fodder grass plus animals under eucalyptus. From each system, replicated soil samples were collected from four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm), fractionated into 2000- to 250-, 250- to 53-, and < 53 mu m size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Macroaggregate was the predominant size fraction under all LUS, especially in the surface soil layers of tree-based systems. In general, C concentrations (g kg(-1) soil) in the different aggregate size fractions did not vary within the same depth. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (Mg C ha(-1)) to 1-m depth was highest under pasture compared with other LUS owing to its higher soil bulk density. The soils under all LUS had higher C stock compared with other reported values for managed tropical ecosystems: down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 461 Mg ha(-1) under pasture to 393 Mg ha(-1) under old eucalyptus. Considering the possibility for formation and retention of microaggregates within macroggregates in low management-intensive systems such as silvopasture, the macroaggregate dynamics in the soil seem to be a good indicator of its C storage potential.

TI  - Richness, diversity and tree composition in the squares of Palmas, Tocantins
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In urban centers, the planning of urban afforestation is essential to guarantee the quality of life of citizens, with green areas and squares being strategic places to promote interaction between people, thermal comfort and the conservation of urban biodiversity. Unlike many Brazilian cities, Palmas, capital of Tocantins state, sought to incorporate in its urban planning since the beginning the delimitation of green areas and squares with the objective of ensuring thermal comfort and leisure for the population. The present study aimed to evaluate the afforestation of the squares in the urbanized blocks of Palmas Urban Plan, characterizing and quantifying the afforestation of the squares implanted in different periods and squares still without infrastructure, comparing their richness, diversity and tree composition. It was also sought to assess whether these locations are fulfilling their socio-environmental role as planned. 2,350 trees from 35 botanical families and 111 species were registered in the squares of 12 blocks in Palmas ??? TO state. The native species of the Cerrado were the most frequent in all square types. The Alpha and Beta diversity analyzes determined that the areas that were not deforested were the most diverse and had more similar communities, positive patterns that differ from those described for the afforestation of most Brazilian squares, a different model that must be preserved and propagated by the public authorities.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon and microbiology community structure due to long-term irrigated agriculture on Luvisols in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the global water cycle affect irrigation requirements and soil processes as well as the structure of soil microbial communities and function and the carbon (C) balance. The microbial structure and C sequestration under land use changing scenarios are rarely studied in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Here, we assessed the effects of land-use changes (irrigation and cultivation) on C storage in the soil and the structure of total bacteria (16S rRNA gene profile) and fungus (18S rRNA gene profile) at soil depth. We evaluated two soil profiles in the semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil. Profile P1 in an area with long-term irrigation (1,500 mm of water per year) and cultivation (small-scale farming systems, mainly with subsistence crops, which is a frequent land use system in the region of irrigated soil) for about 26 years. Profile P2 under natural conditions with 400 mm of water per year of rainfall (rain-fed hyperxerophilic Caatinga). Land-use changes showed a small influence on C storage; however, the changes strongly affected the soil organic matter (SOM) quality as well as the bacterial and fungal community structure, indicated by higher contents of labile-C and microbial biomass along with lower C-CO2 emission. The relatively large amounts of aliphatic groups in the soil surface and subsurface in the cropped system (P1) suggested enrichment of methylene structures and probable increase of microbial-derived compounds. Methoxylic and aromatic groups tend to increase at depth (Bt horizon) indicating that the subsoil C responds to soil management changes. The structures of the bacterial community are distinct at depth in P1 and more similar at depth in P2. On the other hand, the structures of the fungal communities are more similar at depth in P1 than in P2. Furthermore, the irrigated agriculture also presented a carbon management index greater than 140% in most horizons, indicating that the soil management system did not cause soil degradation.

TI  - Shifts in composition of avian communities related to temperate-grassland afforestation in southeastern South America
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation of temperate grasslands with fast-growing trees for industrial pulpwood production is spreading in South America. Despite high afforestation rates resulting from governmental policies that stimulate pulpwood production in grasslands of southern Brazil and Uruguay, the impact of this activity on biodiversity remains to be properly assessed. We used an Impact-Reference study design to evaluate how grassland afforestation affects the composition of grassland bird assemblages. We sampled eucalyptus plantations and neighboring natural grasslands in southern Brazil from 2006-2009, and relied on nested sampling and analysis to separate the effects of afforestation from the natural variability of grasslands. We recorded a significant difference in composition between assemblages from grasslands and tree plantations. Species adapted to open, treeless areas tended to be negatively affected in relation to edge or forest birds in eucalyptus plantations. Afforestation is systematically replacing the bird assemblage of hilltop grasslands by a collection of common edge and forest species that occur in nearby riverine and hillside forests. Although most grassland birds negatively affected by tree plantations are common and widespread, observed and predicted afforestation rates in southeastern South America may result in regional population reductions in the near future.

TI  - Soil carbon stock changes in a crop-livestock-forestry integration in Southern Goiás State, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) has been recommended as a strategy for soil carbon sequestration, compensating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of livestock as well as for sustainable soil management for improving soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health. In this study we quantified SOC accruals in a very clayey (662 g kg-1) Rhodic Ferralsol during the evolution of a 11-year-old crop-livestock-forestry system in the municipality of Cachoeira Dourada, Central-West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional non-managed Pasture area, and soil samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF, and the Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-Tree) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-Alley) having palisade grass. SOC dynamics was different in the upper 30 cm and in the underlying 70 cm layer. In the 0.0-0.3 m layer, after an initial decline in SOC stocks due to soil preparation for the implementation of CLF, SOC accumulation rates were positive in CLF (0.23-0.56 Mg ha-1 yr-1), but negative in the Pasture (-0.05). At 0.3-1.0 m SOC stocks were higher both in 2012 and 2020 in CLF-Tree (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha-1) than in the reference Pasture (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha-1), however, CLF SOC was declining. Total soil N under CLF, compared to the reference Pasture, was lower and declining. These findings confirm that in general CLF is a valid strategy to increase SOC stocks compared to conventional non-managed Pasture, but adequate soil fertility management is necessary to potentialise SOC.

TI  - Promoting Sustainable Agriculture, Boosting Productivity, and Enhancing Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Through the RIO RURAL Program, Brazil
T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Brazilian agricultural sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, but climate-smart practices combined with degraded land restoration can result in a more resilient landscape contributing to integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Sustainable Rural Development Program of Rio de Janeiro (RIO RURAL) has been supporting the transition of degraded rural areas to sustainable productive systems by providing technical assistance and incentives to small-scale family farmers. RIO RURAL promotes reforestation and sustainable agriculture practices, which can boost productivity as well as carbon stocks in the agricultural landscape. Using estimates of carbon mitigation potential for such practices, we identified methodologies eligible for certification in the voluntary markets. We estimated transaction, implementation, and certification costs and calculated potential revenues associated with RIO RURAL's activities. This did not only allow us to discuss the constraints and identify opportunities and co-benefits from RIO RURAL's contribution to climate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental integrity but also to food security as it targets family farms. We propose a bundling approach to carbon, where multiple benefits are measured and certified including water, food systems, as well as social and cultural benefits. This would allow accessing resources from both mitigation and adaptation programs in addition to markets that value ecosystem integrity as well as water and food security.

TI  - Rural household participation in illegal timber felling in a protected area of West Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal logging is a threat to tropical forests in protected areas, yet the factors motivating it need to be better understood. Here, rural household participation in timber felling in the Barisan I Nature Reserve (West Sumatra) was described, the household contextual factors relating to this participation analysed and the importance of these activities to the household income assessed. Nearly 19% of the sampled households cut or hauled timber in the Reserve, and the demand for cash encouraged participation. Alternative livelihoods such as livestock raising and agroforestry intensification outside the Reserve could reduce the need for timber felling. Knowledge about legal status of the Reserve did not affect the odds of a household engaging in timber harvesting, but greater awareness of the Reserve resulted in lower levels of income from timber. Development policy that seeks to provide livelihood alternatives to timber felling households could reduce dependence on timber and contribute to forest conservation in the Reserve. Moreover, conservation outcomes should improve if control over the protection and enforcement of the Reserve is co-managed between the government and the local communities.

TI  - Designing multifunctional landscapes for forest conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A multifunctional landscape approach to forest protection has been advocated for tropical countries. Designing such landscapes necessitates that the role of different land uses in protecting forest be evaluated, along with the spatial interactions between land uses. However, such evaluations have been hindered by a lack of suitable analysis methodologies and data with fine spatial resolution over long time periods. We demonstrate the utility of a matching method with multiple categories to evaluate the role of alternative land uses in protecting forest. We also assessed the impact of land use change trajectories on the rate of deforestation. We employed data from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) at three different time periods during 2000-2012 to illustrate our approach. Four single land uses (protected areas (PA), natural forest logging concessions (LC), timber plantation concessions (TC) and oil-palm plantation concessions (OC)) and two mixed land uses (mixed concessions and the overlap between concessions and PA) were assessed. The rate of deforestation was found to be lowest for PA, followed by LC. Deforestation rates for all land uses tended to be highest for locations that share the characteristics of areas in which TC or OC are located (e.g. degraded areas), suggesting that these areas are inherently more susceptible to deforestation due to foregone opportunities. Our approach provides important insights into how multifunctional landscapes can be designed to enhance the protection of biodiversity.

TI  - Reducing climate impacts of beef production: A synthesis of life cycle assessments across management systems and global regions
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The global demand for beef is rapidly increasing (FAO, 2019), raising concern about climate change impacts (Clark et al., 2020; Leip et al., 2015; Springmann et al., 2018). Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute similar to 6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%-18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of "improved" versus "conventional" beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts and conservation value of exotic and native tree afforestation in Cerrado grasslands using dung beetles
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - . 1. Although plantation forests are being established at an increasing rate, their effects on biodiversity are still debated. 2. Native candeias [Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) Mac Leish] and exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) have recently been planted on Cerrado grasslands. The Cerrado is the second largest biome of Brazil and one of the most threatened savanna ecosystems. 3. Here, we use dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) to investigate the effects of the land-use changes associated to afforestation on Cerrado insect biodiversity. We sampled dung beetles in candeia (4- and 6-year-old) and eucalyptus plantations (1- and 4-year-old), natural candeia formations (candeiais), native grasslands and natural forests. 4. Dung beetle diversity in plantations was lower than in grasslands and forests, but was not different from diversity in natural candeiais. Candeia and 1-year-old eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and natural candeiais all had similar community composition, distinct from natural forests. Four-year-old eucalyptus plantations were intermediate between those two groups. Overall, afforestation was detrimental for dung beetles. 5. Differences between exotic and native plantations were only apparent in older plantations, and seemed to be due to differences associated to canopy openness rather than to the origin of the planted species. Candeia plantations were of better conservation value for open-area species (62% species shared between grasslands and candeia plantation) whereas eucalyptus plantations were so for forest species (26% species shared between forests and eucalyptus plantations). We recommend considering this result before deciding where to plant which species.

TI  - Identifying relevant international forest regimes for South Korea based on their issues
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - South Korea has focused on bilateral agreements to supply timber since the 1990s which requires cooperation with forest-related international organisations. This study analysed the relationship between South Korean and international forest regimes by identifying the issues these regimes face and analysing South Korea's contribution to these regimes. The study used data from an in-depth content analysis of key policy documents between South Korea and each of the regimes. The results confirm six forest-related international issues: Sustainable Forest Management, Sustainable Development Goals, forest land degradation and desertification, climate change, illegal logging, forest biodiversity, and species conservation. South Korea contributed to these regimes through cooperative initiatives and projects. This contribution, furthermore, directs other countries' participation to confront the issues. Most of the international forest-related issues in South Korea are derived from external elements such as international agreements or governances. South Korea also uses international regimes to encourage national goals.

TI  - Sustainable Palm Oil: Dissecting a Global Debate
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE PLANTATION (1ST ICSP 2019)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Plantation (ICSP) - Better Environment with Better Prosperity, Harmonization of Humankind and Nature
CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Palm oil expansion in tropical forest margins captures headlines, primarily out of concern that encroachment to tropical forest causes environmental problem and ignites social issues [1]. Sustainability has to be understood in the wider context of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), rather than as primarily a plot-level ecological concern about persistence of production, to make sense of the debate that has become a very polarized and find ways forward. Cascading ecological and social issues have caused a loss of trust, (threats of) consumer boycotts and multiple standards and certification responses. Diverse sustainability issues have come up as part of a public issue-attention cycle with five recognisable stages [2]: A) Agenda setting, B) Better and widely shared understanding of what is at stake, C) Commitment to common principles, D) Details of devils derailing operations, devolved to (newly created or existing) formal institutions that handle implementation and associated budgets, and E) Efforts to monitor and evaluate effects. In Indonesia two phases of new establishment of palm oil coexist within a forest transition gradient: (i) (industry-led) expansion into new forest margins with many social and ecological consequences; and (ii) (often farmerled) conversion of existing agroforestry and tree crop (often rubber-based) or pasture economies in mosaic landscapes. External consumer concerns refer to the expansion phase, rather than to production sustainability or issues of smallholder concern. However, certification standards are only partially adjusted to the latter. After a 'voluntary industry standards' phase of differentiation with and shifting blame to non-certified others [3], government involvement in Malaysia and Indonesia suggests that standards and certification can trickle down to enforceable good practice standards for all. This can learn from past ineffective policies that did not address the real issues in local context [4]. On the other hand, subnational jurisdictional entities are the scale at which oil palm production can be balanced with other goals, such as forest conservation and smallholder welfare. This needs a supportive and clear national policy support that combines clarity on forest protection (as in the now permanent moratorium), with support for risk-reducing diversified smallholder oil palm production systems [5,6] and international communication that acknowledges past problems but shows Indonesia is ready to move on, connecting all the dots of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Growing Coffea canephora in agroforestry systems with Brazilian firetree, Brazil nut, and teak
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting coffee in agroforestry systems (AFSs) provides diverse advantages to farmers interested in producing environmental services, such as increased local biodiversity, reduction in soil erosion, improvement in water infiltration into the soil, and regulation of climate extremes. It can also be economically attractive due to the possibility of serving alternative markets that have higher and more stable prices for coffees integrated into alternative systems and the generation of products complementary to coffee. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different planting densities of three forest species on the composition of AFSs with coffee plants under the conditions of the southwestern Amazon region. The study was conducted from November 2014 to June 2021 in the experimental field of Embrapa in Ouro Preto do Oeste, RO, Brazil. The coffee plants were intercropped with three forest species: i) Brazilian firetree ( Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum ), ii) Brazil nut ( Bertholletia excelsa ), and iii) teak ( Tectona grandis ). The treatments used in each experiment were four plant densities of plants: zero (coffee plants only, in full sun), 111 plants ha -1 (10 x 9 m), 222 plants ha -1 (10 x 4.5 m), and 444 plants ha -1 (5 x 4.5 m). The experiments were conducted in a split -plot arrangement, with plots consisting of plant densities and subplots consisting of harvest periods (crop seasons). The experimental design was completely randomized, with nine replications. The part of the plot used for data collection consisted of one planted row with 12 coffee plants. The average and accumulated productivities of coffe plants were evaluated over five harvests (2017-2021). Afforestation of the coffee field with Brazilian firetree plants reduces the mean yield and cumulative yield of C. canephora 'Conilon' in the first five commercial crop years. Brazil nut and teak planted at densities of up to 222 trees per hectare did not lead to a reduction in the mean and cumulative yield of coffee plants.

TI  - Anuran fauna of reforested riparian forests: is microhabitat the decisive factor for colonization?
T2  - AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of riparian forests restoration on anuran communities in the Brazilian Cerrado. We analyzed live riparian reforested fragments around a reservoir of an hydroelectric plant using microhabitat variables (humidity, canopy opening, amount of leaf litter and vegetation density), the dominant landscape (matrix type, fragment width) and reforestation age. We tested whether anuran abundance, richness and diversity were influenced by these variables using generalized linear models. Matrix type and fragment width were limiting factors for anurans to reach and establish themselves in riparian k)rest fragments, whereas microhabitat and reforestation age did not influence anuran succession. We conclude that reforestation in the midst of impermeable matrices creates anuran communities dominated by widely-distributed species that live in open areas, reflecting the highly modified surrounding habitat.

TI  - The role of third-party audits in ensuring producer compliance with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Certification systems for sustainable agricultural commodities typically rely on auditors to verify that producers comply with environmental, social, and legal standards. In the oil palm industry, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification system promises to address core sectoral sustainability concerns-including deforestation, fire, biodiversity loss, peatland drainage, forced labor, and land tenure conflict-by applying third-party audits to large-scale oil palm growers. Audits are designed to detect noncompliances with the standard, and to ensure that growers resolve these nonconformities. Yet, the role of RSPO audits in generating additionality across key sustainability issues remains unclear. Here, we compiled and analyzed data from a timeseries of annual audit reports for two-thirds of all certified oil palm growers in Indonesia as of December 2015 (n = 114 certified growers and 262 reports). We found that certified growers were required to address a median of four noncompliances per audit (range 0-37), with more noncompliances detected at initial certification than during subsequent audits. Certification demanded the most changes under our thematic areas of Waste & Pollution (9% of all noncompliances) and Employment (7%) and the least changes in Fire (<1%) and Corporate Social Responsibility programs (<1%). Thus, while many RSPO certified growers make real changes to achieve certification, these changes do not always address core sectoral performance concerns. Regression analysis indicated that RSPO member and certification body were significantly correlated with noncompliance frequency. This suggests that each member has a different cost of compliance and indicates heterogeneous stringency of standard application by certification bodies. We recommend that future research evaluate how post-2015 changes in RSPO assurance processes have interacted with a more robust and comprehensive certification standard to alter the additionality from third-party audits.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Mindanao State Univ, Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Indonesia is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse emission globally. The trigger of such contributions can be traced to Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). The problem of deforestation is complex, involving social, economic and political sectors. On the other hand, a holistic approach has not been widely discussed and implemented. This paper attempts to review and aims at providing potential answer on how to manage the forest and its relations with people in order to combat forest destruction caused by people. We believed that managing such relationship is the key to maintain the sustainability of the forest while keeping its roles and sustainability. Literature review was employed to develop a problem framework, and to develop alternatives in bridging the relationships between forest and local community. Collecting relevant literatures using keywords such as "forest and climate change mitigation", "agroforestry and climate change", "ecotourism and climate change", and "agroforestry and ecotourism", 96 articles were found. Further, through matching the content and the research goals of the articles, 13 articles were selected for further content analysis. We proposed agro-ecotourism as the alternative answer that can be pursued to balance the relationship between forest and people, especially in putting forest as an important partner rather than an exploitable asset. Hence, agro-ecotourism may help to increase the awareness among local community on the critical roles of the forest in the long term to fight against climate changes.

TI  - Fire regime in the Brazilian Savanna: Recent changes, policy and management
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019 Brazil recorded the highest wildland fire occurrence South America has seen for the last 15 years. Added to the Amazon, the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) faces changes in fire regimes. Climatic changes and the recent weakening of environmental law enforcement are factors, but historic and large-scale trends and drivers of fire regimes must be analyzed. We discuss ecological and policy drivers of recent changes in fire regimes in the Cerrado, in order to highlight management strategies. The Cerrado has evolved with natural fires and anthropogenic fires are also common for millennia. In the past 50 years, wildfires tend to be concentrated in the late dry season and to occur every two / three years, causing serious damage in fire-sensitive vegetation. Apart from climatic variations, the drivers of wildfires are deforestation and fire suppression policies. Nearly half of the original vegetation of the Cerrado biome has disappeared largely due to agribusiness expansion. Fire is associated with deforestation in two ways: vegetation conversion to monocultures, and lack of fire management in the remaining native vegetation. Indeed, the attempts to exclude fires from this fire-prone ecosystem disrupted traditional fire management. Fire suppression policies lead to increased wildfire risks due to fuel load and the multiplication of sources of ignition (conflicts, roads). The recent advances in Integrated Fire Management in protected areas in the Cerrado are evident. However, the recent budget cuts by the Brazilian government in environmental management and research undermine the chances of decreasing occurrences of wildfires in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Seasonal forecasting of fire over Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale fires occur frequently across Indonesia, particularly in the southern region of Kalimantan and eastern Sumatra. They have considerable impacts on carbon emissions, haze production, biodiversity, health, and economic activities.In this study, we demonstrate that severe fire and haze events in Indonesia can generally be predicted months in advance using predictions of seasonal rainfall from the ECMWF System 4 coupled ocean-atmosphere model. Based on analyses of long, up-to-date series observations on burnt area, rainfall, and tree cover, we demonstrate that fire activity is negatively correlated with rainfall and is positively associated with deforestation in Indonesia. There is a contrast between the southern region of Kalimantan (high fire activity, high tree cover loss, and strong non-linear correlation between observed rainfall and fire) and the central region of Kalimantan (low fire activity, low tree cover loss, and weak, non-linear correlation between observed rainfall and fire).The ECMWF seasonal forecast provides skilled forecasts of burnt and fire-affected area with several months lead time explaining at least 70% of the variance between rainfall and burnt and fire-affected area. Results are strongly influenced by El Nino years which show a consistent positive bias. Overall, our findings point to a high potential for using a more physical-based method for predicting fires with several months lead time in the tropics rather than one based on indexes only. We argue that seasonal precipitation forecasts should be central to Indonesia's evolving fire management policy.

TI  - Effect of different irradiance levels on anatomy and growth of two Malvaceae species during two seasons
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hot spot in a global context that has been undergoing deforestation and fragmentation in the last centuries. The remnant fragments are under the risk of extinction due to continuous and intense anthropic action. Therefore, many restoration projects have been proposed to recover degraded areas. In this study, we evaluated the anatomical acclimation mechanisms and growth of Guazuma ulmifolia and Ceiba speciosa under different irradiance conditions in dry and wet seasons. Both species are used in restoration projects. We found that under low irradiance, plants allocated more resources to leaves than roots and developed larger and thinner leaves with lower stomatal density. On the other hand, when exposed to high-irradiance (HI) conditions, we observed a smaller leaf area and specific leaf area, thicker leaves and increased root biomass. Both species showed better quality (higher values of Dickson quality index) at HI and dry season, presumably because soil moisture was maintained constant during the experiment. Therefore, we concluded that C. speciosa and G. ulmifolia have a better performance under high-irradiance and well-watered conditions, suggesting that both species can be used in open areas of reforestation projects.

T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerated and disordered growth of cities contributes to the increase in environmental deterioration unleashed mainly by the lack of basic infrastructure, fragmentation and loss of habitats. All these factors culminate in the loss of biodiversity and decrease of the quality of life of the citizens. In this context, the maintenance of green areas in urban centers becomes indispensable to minimize the effects of urbanization on the environment and the urban population, since they perform various environmental services such as landscape, ecological, climatic, recreational and psychological. In this manner, through this project, We evaluated the impact of the implementation of the BRT public transportation system on the afforestation of the central plat of the Teotonio Segurado Avenue in Palmas, Tocantins, discussing its effects on urban ecological structure and environmental services. We also analyzed an alternative proposal for tracing the BRT circulation channel in order to reduce its impact on local afforestation. A total of 3,980 arboreal individuals of 112 species were registered on the Teotonio Segurado Avenue, totaling 72.64 ind./ha. The impact on the afforestation of the original BRT circulation channel on the central area of the avenue is about 30% greater than the alternative route proposed in this study, with at least 456 individuals being suppressed. In terms of composition and biological and ecological importance, the design of the original project will cause the suppression of 23 more native species of the cerrado when compared to the alternative route. The impacts on the afforestation of the original design of the BRT circulation channels imply the loss of several environmental services provided by the vegetation of the Teotonio Segurado Avenue, such as mitigation of air pollution and noise, decrease of the islands of heat, improvement of the quality of life, maintenance and dispersion of species, therefore, revealing that the proposed alternative route is the most viable environmental and socioeconomical option.

AB  - Jakabaring and its surrounding which is part of Palembang are also experienced a high level exposure to hazard of inundation, where the area is heavily affected by tides which are mostly swamps, consisting of reclamation and protection swamps that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This study aims to determine the level of risk due to inundation hazards that occur in current conditions and projected conditions through risk assessment with spatial approaches and adaptation strategies needed, The vulnerability parameters that used are exposure (topography, land use, infrastructure), adaptation capacity (drainage), sensitivity (population density, education level, age, gender and poverty). In the baseline condition, Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on moderate level of risk. Meanwhile in the projection condition (2030), Jakabaring and its surrounding areas is on high level of risk. The adaptation strategies due to climate change impact that can be carried out are river normalization, drainage normalization, infiltration measure, pumping, green open space, canalization, bio-pore, water retention ponds, multiplying gardens in residential area, roads enhancement, pavement enhancement, polders along rivers, and supervision of swamp regulations.

TI  - Social and Environmental Impacts of Forest Management Certification in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to unsustainable timber production in tropical forest concessions, voluntary forest management certification programs such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been introduced to improve environmental, social, and economic performance over existing management practices. However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km(2) on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33%), respiratory infections (by 32%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy.

CP  - Workshop on Soil Structural Quality of Tropical Soils - Visual Evaluation Methods and Soil Compaction Prevention Strategies
CL  - Maringa, BRAZIL
AB  - Visual soil evaluation techniques have gained popularity and are increasingly used in agriculture and soil science for research, consultancy and teaching purposes. We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer's fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index. Visual soil evaluation techniques also provide a useful visual aid for improving soil awareness in groups of stakeholders, helping the exchange of knowledge and ideas for innovation in agriculture.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Payments for Environmental Service (PES) schemes are increasingly discussed as a possibility to promote the conservation of natural resources. However, these pilot schemes are frequently small in size and face high transaction costs, leading to the exclusion of smallholders. Solutions could be to use collectively bundled contracts or existing community resource management arrangement structures. Using the example of the institution of the community conservation agreements (CCA) in Central Sulawesi we assess whether a community arrangement can provide the framework conditions to implement a PES project. Four points are necessary: an organisational structure representing the village households; participation of the resource users in the institutional implementation; monitoring and enforcement by the institution of the forest usage regulations; and, finally, the institutions' ability to administer funds. Our findings show that the CCAs are backed up by an organisational structure, the village conservation council. However, in most villages the community members were not involved and did not know of the agreement negotiation. A monitoring entity has been constituted. The awareness for nature conservation has increased only in the recent past, but resource extraction has left its marks, and the participants perceived environmental problems to be growing. Finally, compensation payments are regarded on the one hand as a good reimbursement for desisting from using the forest resources. On the other hand, due to the negative experiences with corruption, a clear organisational structure for the administration of such a project is necessary, which does not seem to be given with the current institutional arrangements. Therefore, we recommend using existing community arrangements because established structures can be used. However, these need to be enriched to fulfil the requirements of a PES project. It is of major importance to involve the community members in the management of natural resource projects to increase compliance with regulations.

TI  - The Potential of Biochar as an Acid Soil Amendment to Support Indonesian Food and Energy Security - A Review
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The future of Indonesian food and energy security is challenged by the limited availability of productive land due to the land conversion issue and, in particular, the leveling-off of rice soil productivity. Acid soils as major contributor to marginal soils occupy approximately 55% of the total terrestrial land in Indonesia. To support the Indonesian policy on food and energy security, acid dryland soil areas have targeted for agricultural land expansion. However, managing such soils for crop productivity with conventional amendments, such as lime was challenged by the availability of lime, its cost and the adverse effects of over-liming. Recent research findings indicate that biochar, with its liming capacity and other beneficial effects, could serve as an amendment to acid soils. A question then can be asked: can biochar be a potential solution for the multiple constraints of Indonesian acid soil? The objectives of this review are to explore the potential of biochar as an amendment to Indonesian acid dryland soils and to develop a research framework for future studies involving biochar so as to support the future of Indonesian food and energy security. Articles and conference papers were selected, studied and critically reviewed. Specific problems with Indonesian acid dryland soils and the utilization of biochar as a potential amendment to the suboptimal soil in Indonesia were investigated. Biochar is alkaline in nature and recent research findings strongly indicate that with its liming effect, water and nutrient retention capability, highly recalcitrant nature, and carbon sequestration capacity could be a potential solution for improving upland acid soil productivity. This could be supported by the huge and sustainable production of feedstock in Indonesia.

TI  - Sustainable Harvesting of Cinnamomum burmannii (Nees & T. Nees) Blume in Kerinci Regency, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cinnamomum burmannii (Nees & T. Nees) Blume is an endemic tree of up to 20 meters tall that grows in the surrounding forest in the Kerinci regency. Cinnamon is one of the most valuable non-timber forest products (NTFP) harvested from Kerinci. The tree is classified as an NTFP based on criteria set out by a regulation of the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry in 2007. As a result, it must be harvested sustainably. Its massive cultivation has caused deforestation in several areas in Kerinci. The objective of this paper is to assess the environmental impacts of continuous C. burmannii harvesting of the bark by clearcutting the whole tree. Intensive clearcutting, slash, and burn posed a significant threat for (wildlife) biodiversity in the habitat of C. burmannii. The study was performed in collaboration with the Institute for Agricultural Technology of Jambi (BPTP) from October 2018-January 2019. A harvester group in Lempur Mudik village was surveyed through a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, interviews and direct observations on C. burmannii production methods and their impact on forest conservation. We discuss how young farmers can contribute to forest conservation through sustainable harvesting of cinnamon. We conclude by suggesting leverages for forest conservation and by proposing actions from the local and national governments that should be urgently taken to safeguard wildlife biodiversity in the surrounding forest.

TI  - An occupational ergonomics in the Indonesian state mandatory sustainable forest management instrument: A review
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Designed as a biodiversity-maintenance concept, Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) considers not only forest for its ecological function, but also forestry workers whom play a significant role in executing the SFM program in the implementation stage. By using occupational ergonomics approach, this paper aims to examine how the Indonesian mandatory SFM certification, the so-called Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi Lestari (PHPL) positioned forestry workers in its SFM scheme. This issue is important since forestry work is a well-known profession with high occupational safety and health (OSH) risk. Content analysis on occupational ergonomics-related national policies and the mandatory PHPL Criteria and Indicators (C&I), and interviews with forest managers, PHPL auditor, and forestry workers indicate the poor performance of the instrument to assess the occupational-ergonomics-related factors at a practical level. This study reveals that PHPL is more of administrative liability obligation fulfillments rather than performance-based fulfillments (meanwhile, OSH status should be seen as an outcome of a good safety culture rather than an artifact/document). This study verifies content-overlap among the verifiers, content mismatch between the verifiers and the actual characteristic of forest operation, and the absence of distinct assessment standard. This study also discovers the existence of "ergonomics holes" in the PHPL C&I: (1) promoting a safe working environment for forestry workers, (2) distinct organization structural linkage on safety responsibility assignments, (3) emergency procedure, (4) distinct qualification for heavy machine operator and chemical technician, (5) sub-contract workers, and (6) the importance of management commitment and workers' participation. Revision on PHPL should seriously consider integrating OSH and wellbeing aspect as mentioned in Indonesia's national policies concerning manpower and occupational safety.

TI  - Similarity analysis of Cedrela sp trees under different growth conditions in eastern state of Acre, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity of tropical forests depends on certain level of environmental disturbances, such as the natural fall of trees providing clearings, seed germination, growth and development of plants that environment. On the other hand, forest management intervenes in this natural cycle, by removing larger trees of the species which are of great commercial value. However, little is known about natural growth and regeneration of the. hundreds of tropical species; and this constitutes a gap and obstacle to the implementation of sustainable forest management, by permitting the maintenance of biodiversity. In this regard, this study aims to determine the age and growth periodicity of stem of native Cedrela sp. trees in-Acre under different growth conditions (sites and microsites) to provide subsidies to sustainable forest management in this region. Trees of Cedrela sp were selected at three sites: Experimental Reserve Catuaba (REC) (three microsites), Farm Sao Jorge (FSJ) Zoobotanic Park (PZ). Wood samples were collected at DBH of the trunk for the dendrochronological analysis. This was followed by the demarcation, counting and measuring the width of growth rings. Next, the Cofecha program was used for the quality control of the series of growth rings. Using the parameters: number, average width of the growth ring, standard deviation and the DBH of the tree stems, a similarity of trees Cedrela sp. in site and microsites was observed by multivariate statistical analysis Different growth conditions (sites and environments) significantly affected the radial growth of trees Cedrela sp, demonstrating the potential of dendrochronology as a tool for forest Management.

TI  - Carbon Depletion by Plowing and its Restoration by No-Till Cropping Systems in Oxisols of Subtropical and Tropical Agro-Ecoregions in Brazil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous use of plowing for grain production has been the principal cause of soil degradation. This project was formulated on the hypothesis that the intensification of cropping systems by increasing biomass-C input and its biodiversity under no-till (NT) drives soil restoration of degraded agro-ecosystem. The present study conducted at subtropical [Ponta Grossa (PG) site] and tropical regions [Lucas do Rio Verde, MT (LRV) site] in Brazil aimed to (i) assess the impact of the continuous plow-based conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock vis-a-vis native vegetation (NV) as baseline; (ii) compare SOC balance among CT, NT cropping systems, and NV; and (iii) evaluate the redistribution of SOC stock in soil profile in relation to soil resilience. The continuous CT decreased the SOC stock by 058 and 067MgCha(-1)y(-1) in the 0- to 20-cm depth at the PG and LRV sites, respectively, and the rate of SOC sequestration was 059 for the PG site and ranged from 048 to 130MgCha(-1)y(-1) for the LRV site. The fraction of C input by crop residues converted into SOC stock was 142% at the PG site and 205% at the LRV site. The SOC resilience index ranged from 029 to 079, and it increased with the increase in the C input among the NT systems and the SOC sequestration rates at the LRV site. These data support the hypothesis that NT cropping systems with high C input have a large potential to reverse the process of soil degradation and SOC decline.

TI  - The effectiveness of global protected areas for climate change mitigation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a critical role in stabilizing Earth's climate. Establishing protected areas (PAs) represents one approach to forest conservation, but PAs were rarely created to mitigate climate change. The global impact of PAs on the carbon cycle has not previously been quantified due to a lack of accurate global-scale carbon stock maps. Here we used similar to 412 million lidar samples from NASA's GEDI mission to estimate a total PA aboveground carbon (C) stock of 61.43 Gt (+/- 0.31), 26% of all mapped terrestrial woody C. Of this total, 9.65 + /- 0.88 Gt of additional carbon was attributed to PA status. These higher C stocks are primarily from avoided emissions from deforestation and degradation in PAs compared to unprotected forests. This total is roughly equivalent to one year of annual global fossil fuel emissions. These results underscore the importance of conservation of high biomass forests for avoiding carbon emissions and preserving future sequestration.

TI  - Carbon stocks and dynamics of different land uses on the Cerrado agricultural frontier
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest and most dynamic agricultural frontier in Brazil is known as MATOPIBA, an area that covers part of the Cerrado biome. Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990-2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS100) by 37.3% (p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS100 by 34% (p = 0.034) and 26.5% (p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C (p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest.

TI  - Edge effects on the cavity-nesting hymenopteran communities and their natural enemies within fragmented landscapes.
T2  - Apidologie
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in landscape structure have increased the edge amount between different environments, and its implications for biodiversity may vary depending on the level of analysis, ecological groups, and species life history. We investigated the effect of distance from the forest edge on species of solitary wasps and bees and their associated natural enemies, on a gradient from 200 m into the anthropogenic matrix to 200 m into the forest, in Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil. In general, species were positively affected by forest edge proximity, while those forest specialists were more negatively influenced. The natural enemy species were more dependent on the distribution of their hosts than on the edge effect directly. Caterpillar and spider hunters seem to be positively affected by the edge, while pollen collectors progressively decrease their richness and abundance from the matrix towards the interior of forest area, and cockroach hunters present an opposite response. We demonstrate the importance of forest conservation and reforestation programs, not only by some cavity-nesting wasps and bees being entirely dependent on forests to persist, but also because most species sampled here depend on being close to a forest edge (less than 100 m) to carry out their ecological holes. Therefore, understanding how different species respond to environmental and landscape changes and may depend on staying close to forests is essential for effective management and planning strategies for biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Recovery of species diversity and composition of braconid parasitic wasps after reforestation of degraded grasslands in lowland East Kalimantan
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced disturbances and wildfires can transform areas of tropical rainforest into Imperata-dominated grassland, but it may be possible that recovery of biodiversity is facilitated by reforestation with fast-growing trees. We compared the assemblages of braconid wasps as parasitoids of taxonomically diverse groups of insects among Imperata grasslands, young and mature plantations of Acacia mangium, young secondary forests after wildfires, and old secondary forests in the lowland of East Kalimantan. The abundance and species richness of braconids, which had declined in Imperata grasslands, somewhat increased in Acacia plantations, and also the species composition of braconids in Acacia plantations was transitional between Imperata grasslands and old secondary forests. Parasitoids of detritivores and wood borers increased markedly after plantation, while those of herbivores showed a distinct turnover of species all over the range from grasslands to old secondary forests. The plantation of A. mangium had most likely facilitated the recovery of the diversity of host forest and their parasitoids, but the recovery was just at the rudimentary stage even in mature plantations. Monitoring of parasitic wasps would be useful to test the continuous recovery of forest biodiversity in plantation stands.

TI  - CARBON AND NITROGEN STOCK IN SOIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE COASTAL TABLELANDS OF PARAIBA STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of the natural systems by sugar cane leads to fundamental alterations in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and consequently in the global cycle of these elements. This study was conducted in the municipality of Capim, Paraiba State, and the objective was to evaluate carbon and nitrogen stocks in soils of a natural forest in comparison to sugar cane with and without vinasse. The studied soil was a Dystrophic Gray Argisol. The soil samplings were performed in five replicates (five profiles) at the depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 e 20-40 cm. The systems were selected namely, native forest; sugar cane with vinasse and cane sugar without vinasse. The carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks decrease after the change of native forest to plant sugar cane. In general, there is not significant difference in the carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks between the environments of cane sugar. The systems of cane sugar with and without vinasse are functioning as C -CO2 emitter when compared with the native forest.

TI  - Diversity of soil spiders in land use and management systems in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of spiders to spread over contiguous areas (Arachnida: Araneae) is directly related to soil management conditions. The objective of this work was to study the effect of land use system (LUS) on the abundance and diversity of soil spider families and their relationship with soil physical and chemical properties. The evaluated LUS were: native forest, eucalyptus reforestation, pasture, crop-livestock integration, and no-tillage crop. Samples were collected in three municipalities of Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, considered as true replicates, during winter and summer. A total of 270 samples was taken in each area and season. The sampling points were arranged in a grid of 3 x 3 m, spaced by 30 m. We evaluated soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes and the abundance and diversity of spider families, collected by soil monolith and soil traps. A total of 448 spiders were captured, 152 in winter and 296 in summer, distributed in 24 families and 52 species/morphospecies. There was a seasonality effect related to the land use systems and the highest Shannon-Wiener diversity index was recorded in the native forest in both sampling periods. Most families of spiders have a direct dependence on soil physical and chemical properties, such as microporosity, exchangeable aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and potassium during the winter. Organic matter, nitrogen, pH in water, weighted average diameter, soil density, and microbial biomass carbon exhibited dependence during the summer. Vegetation type and soil management are the factors that seem to affect most the occurrence of spiders. The families Theridiidae and Nemesiidae are dependent on sites with low human intervention.

TI  - Microtopographic specialization and flexibility in tropical peat swamp forest tree species
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical tree species distributions are determined by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, including topography and hydrology. Tropical peat swamp forests (TPSFs) are characterized in part by small-scale variations in topography ('hummocks' and 'hollows') that create distinct microhabitats and thus may contribute to niche diversification among TPSF tree species. Using tree elevations calibrated to daily peat water levels collected using a data logger and a permutation test, we evaluated topographical microhabitat preferences for 21 tree species in a relatively undisturbed TPSF in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to determine whether these species show preferential association with hummocks or hollows and to quantify the prevalence of microhabitat specialization among them. Only one species, Tetractomia tetrandrum, emerged as a hollow specialist, with no hummock specialists among the species tested. The remaining 20 species, including Psydrax dicoccos, which had the lowest mean observed elevation, and Maasia hypoleuca, which had the highest mean observed elevation, showed no clear microtopographic preference. This suggests that many TPSF species may be resilient to the natural hydrologic variations that occur in relatively intact peat swamp forests. Such studies of microtopographic preferences of tree species in TPSF and other wetland forest ecosystems can inform selection of tree species for reforestation projects, and potentially also provide information on how future climate change may impact these habitats and their resident tree species.

TI  - Assessment of drought effects on survival and growth dynamics in eucalypt commercial forestry using remote sensing photogrammetry. A showcase in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The plantation of fast-growing tree species plays a crucial role in supplying forest products to growing economies while relieving pressure on native forests reducing the overexploitation of native ecosystems. Grown in more than 90 countries, Eucalyptus spp. are fast-growing tree species driving economic production comprising pulp, wood, or thermal energy. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme drought episodes: the 2019 drought in Mato Grosso, Brazil, was the second driest episode ever recorded. Forest inventory data comprising thousands of individual tree measurements collected in consecutive surveys - years 2019, 2020, 2021 - were modelled with mixed-effects models to identify significant factors influencing tree mortality after drought. Time-series of growth dynamics of the four eucalypt commercial clones were tested. For the landscape assessment, surveys using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported a high-resolution image mosaicking to derive digital surface models and the vegetation indexes driving segmentation and classification methods using ground plot-level observations as training data. The impact of drought was measured in terms of mortality, growth dynamics and the financial losses computed when valuing the 1400-ha plantation along the 3-year series. The modelling results showed high-stocking plantations suffered more from extreme water-stress conditions. The interaction between stocking and clone was analysed. On average, the 2019 drought triggered an estimate loss of $3500 per hectare. The estimation of live and dead conditions using UAV-based outcomes reached an overall accuracy of 89% and 0.7 in the Cohen's kappa used to map forest health wall-to-wall. Our findings advocate for a reduction of tree planting density and enhanced clone selection to turn eucalypt plantations more resilient to extreme water-stress. Combining UAV-based remote sensing technology, ground truth data and management expertise in eucalypt management eases the operationalization of data-driven solutions towards more resilient silvicultural guidelines and increased efficiency of forest plantations.

TI  - Paradox of afforestation in cities in the Brazilian Amazon: An understanding of the composition and floristic similarity of these urban green spaces
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces play an important role in improving the quality of life and sustainability in cities and require careful empirical evaluation. This study looked into the contradiction of native species being underrepresented in urban environments in Brazilian Amazon cities, compared to exotic species that have been introduced. It also sought to determine whether there is floristic similarity between the States' urban environments, and if so, what effect geographic distance has on this process; and what implications the States' urbanization gradient has for floristic density of urban afforestation, taking into account the realities of cities infrastructure. A floristic matrix comprising information about the origin of the species and quantitative data was developed using data from scholarly journals and a comprehensive literature study. The floristic consistency of urban vegetation was tested between surveys using dendrograms, indicator species and ordination analyzes. A total of 1333 species were found, of which 59 % were classified as exotic. The floristic profile of urban afforestation among States was characterized by a high richness of the Fabaceae family and by a high representativeness of Moquilea tomentosa, Mangifera indica and Ficus benjamina species. Native species had the lowest tree density values in the urban gradient examined, ranging from 2.2 +/- 0.36 tree/ha to 0.19 +/- 0.03 tree/ha. Based on the results from the NonMetric Multidimensional Scale (NMDS) ordination technique together with the cluster analysis, it was confirmed that the greatest floristic similarities were found among municipalities in the States located geographically closer together. It is concluded that floristic richness proportionally decreases with the expansion of metropolitan cities. These findings suggest that the urban afforestation in Amazonian cities, are not spatially or ecologically uniform. This information can help to make future decisions regarding the correct planning of species to be introduced into urban spaces in cities.

TI  - SEED BANK OF NATURAL FOREST REMAINDERS AND REFORESTATION AREAS IN A MOGI-GUACU RIVER FLOODPLAIN, LUIZ ANTONIO COUNTY, SAO PAULO STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate qualitative and quantitatively the seed bank of two natural forest remainders, one Eucalyptus robusta plantation and three reforestation areas with native species, located in a riparian area of Mogi-Guacu River floodplain, in Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31'S and 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The evaluation was carried out in 12 plots of 10 x 10 m systematically distributed in each area. Four subplots of 0.5 m x 0.5 m were randomly distributed in each plot. Two subplots were used to evaluate the seed bank in the litter and two in the soil sample at the 0 - 5 cm depth. The sampling was accomplished in September 2001 in the natural forest remainders and in the eucalyptus plantation and, in September 2002, in the reforested areas. The soil and the litter were conditioned in plastic pots, and incubated with periodic irrigations for the seed germination during seven months, in two greenhouse environment conditions: one at 100% sunlight and the other, under a screen that provides a 70% sunlight reduction. In the composition of all sample area seed banks, there was a predomination of pioneer species at the early successional stages. The most important arboreal species were Aloysia virgata and Cecropia hololeuca. The reforestation with native species provided a seed bank with a greater diversity of native arboreal species than the eucalyptus plantation. The present study indicates that the similarity between the planted and natural forest should be enhanced over the time.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and reduction strategies for the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, it is crucial to examine the contributions of leading countries in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This research provides an overview of global GHG emissions from 1970 to 2022 for the world's most polluting countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Iran, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. These countries collectively account for approximately 64% of GHG emissions. The aim is to understand the impact of various economic sectors, such as industry, energy, agriculture, and transportation, on overall emissions. The analysis highlights the disparity in per capita emissions, with smaller but major oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, exhibiting high per capita emission levels, while more populated countries like the United States and South Korea show lower per capita values but significant total emission volumes. The study suggests that transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in industry, promoting sustainable agriculture, reforestation, and electrifying transportation are key methods to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). Recommendations include encouraging technological innovations, implementing stringent government regulations and standards, and garnering active support for GHG reduction programs from governments, financial institutions, and the business community. The urgency is emphasized for global efforts to combat climate change for ensuring a sustainable future.

TI  - Do subtropical grasslands recover spontaneously after afforestation?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims South American Pampa grasslands are habitats of great conservation interest, with a distinct and rich flora, but have been intensely converted to other land uses, including tree plantations. While necessity for restoration grows, no information on restoration potential of grasslands after afforestation exists. Here, we aim at analyzing composition and structure of grassland vegetation with a history of eucalyptus plantations in order to assess recovery potential of these areas. We hypothesized that areas with history of eucalyptus would differ from reference grasslands with no history of land-use change in terms of floristic and functional composition and would present lower species richness.Methods Our study region comprised four sites in the southeastern part of the Pampa biome, in the coastal plain in the extreme south of Brazil, always with sites with long (50 years) history of eucalyptus plantation and reference grassland. We sampled vegetation at post-eucalyptus sites (with and without resprouting) 10 years after clearclutting and in natural grasslands. We analyzed data by analysis of variance and ordination techniques, considering compositional parameters and life forms, and indicator species analysis.Important Findings Species richness and vegetation cover were higher in reference grassland than in resprout areas but did not differ from post-eucalyptus areas. Exotic species cover was significantly higher in areas with afforestation history. In terms of total composition, natural grasslands differed significantly from areas with past plantation use. Indicator species analyses revealed considerable differences between grassland types. In conclusion, vegetation development led to grassland communities that are still quite distinct from reference sites. Likely, the specificity of grassland management has a high importance in defining vegetation trajectories in time and importance for grassland recovery, and restoration needs to be addressed in more studies.

TI  - Soil fauna under eucalypt stands of different ages in the Savanna of Piaui
T2  - Cientifica (Jaboticabal)
M3  - Article
AB  - The reforestation with eucalyptus has increased significantly in the Brazilian Savanah and it can promote changes on soil biological properties, mainly soil fauna. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of soil fauna in areas with Eucalyptus plantations of different ages compared with native savanna. The study was conducted in Eucalytptus plantations aged one, two, three and four years and area with native forest was taken as reference. Soil fauna was collected in the dry and rainy season to evaluate the number of individuals from different taxonomic groups, richness, uniformity and diversity. The highest number of soil fauna was found in eucalyptus plantations with one year old at both seasons. However, the richness did not differ between seasons. In areas where with eucalyptus plantations with one and two years old showed 90% of individuals represented by Coleoptera and Formicidae, which contributed for decreasing in fauna uniformity. The implantation of Eucalyptus early reduced the diversity and uniformity of soil fauna; however, there was a recovery of this biological attribute after two years of reforestation.

TI  - Difficult times for amphibians: Effects of land-use change at the local and landscape scales in the Ibera Wetlands
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change and management practices have led to habitat loss, one of the greatest factors in biodiversity decline. Particularly, amphibians comprise the highest number of threatened vertebrate species at the global scale. In this work, amphibian communities were analysed in three differing landscapes: a protected wetland, a livestock-impaired rangeland and a pine afforestation. In each landscape, amphibian species were sampled. Land cover type and composition, as well as primary vegetation types were characterised at the landscape and local scale, respectively. The relationship between these environmental variables and the amphibian communities was analysed. Twenty-one amphibian species were identified; the protected and afforested landscapes were the richest, whereas the rangeland showed the lowest species richness and diversity estimates. At the local scale, vegetation, water coverage and land-use category explained the higher presence of amphibian species and their abundance. These results show how different land-uses, especially livestock farming, modify the composition of amphibian communities. This work constitutes a foundation for the development of sustainable management practices for conserving amphibians in landscape-level altered habitats.

TI  - Striking the balance: Fiqh Bi'ah and Productive Waqf Forests (PWFs) for sustainable forest management in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to address the challenge of balancing economic development with environmental protection in the context of productive waqf forests (PWFs). The inherent tension between forest productivity and protection necessitates a model that ensures sustainable utilization. This research proposes a novel framework by integrating fiqh bi'ah (Islamic environmental jurisprudence) with a model for PWFs development. Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative approach, the analytical network process (ANP) analyzes data gathered through a literature review of Islamic environmental jurisprudence (fiqh bi'ah) on environment and waqf, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with academics, practitioners and regulators in fiqh bi'ah and waqf forest management. FindingsThree potential PWFs development models emerge from the fiqh bi'ah literature; Harim (maintaining the natural forest state for intangible benefits like oxygen and biodiversity), Hima (sustainable utilization of forest products while preserving ecological components) and Ihya' al-mawat (developing unproductive land into a future forest). The ANP analysis reveals that Hima is the most preferred model by all stakeholders, followed by Ihya' al-mawat. The Harim model received lower preference due to limited economic potential. Additionally, experts suggest tourism-based forest management as the most suitable approach for all three PWFs models. Originality/valueThis study offers a novel PWFs development model grounded in fiqh bi'ah principles. By using ANP to integrate diverse stakeholder perspectives, the research provides valuable insights for sustainable and ethical management of PWFs resources, contributing to the literature on Islamic finance and business models.

TI  - End of the line for the golden lion tamarin? A single road threatens 30 years of conservation efforts
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads have a myriad of negative effects on biodiversity, ultimately threatening the persistence of populations. In this Perspective we call attention to an extreme example, where the entire current geographic range of the endangered golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia, GLT) is bisected by a major highway that is being widened to four lanes. We believe that the planned mitigation actions are not enough to reduce the expected increase of barrier effects and road mortality. These impacts may lead to a sequence of cascading effects that could jeopardize the conservation actions that prevented the extinction of GLTs three decades ago. We identify specific road sections along the highway and accompanying paved roads in the region that if equipped with tailored over passages would greatly reduce the road barrier effects. We also highlight areas where reforestation efforts could be extended in order to help reestablishing the connectivity between GLT habitat areas. We suggest that the working group integrating key decision makers and stakeholders, including the Non-governmental organization leading the conservation efforts, partner universities, national road and environmental agencies, and the road construction company, to implement and to monitor the complementary road passages to improve connectivity of GLT habitat, and consequently to ensure the species' survival.

TI  - Large trees as key elements of carbon storage and dynamics after selective logging in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The long term effect of Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL) on above-ground live biomass (AGB) dynamics was investigated in 18 1-ha logged over permanent sample plots set up in a ten-afirme rain forest in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20-40,40-60, >= 60 cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh >= 20 cm) were 187 +/- 14 trees ha(-1) and 377.6 +/- 62.8 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Although big trees (dbh >= 60 cm) only represented 93% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8 years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8 years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha(-1) would save 27.7 Mg C ha(-1) for a 35 years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market. Sustainable forest management aiming at enhancing carbon stocks could therefore promote the preservation of the large trees. At our study site, we recommend the adoption of a maximum diameter cutting limit of 110 cm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Recovery of species diversity and composition of braconid parasite wasps after reforestation of degraded grasslands in lowland east Kalimantan.
T2  - Journal of Insect Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced disturbances and wildfires can transform areas of tropical rainforest into Imperata-dominated grassland, but it may be possible that recovery of biodiversity is facilitated by reforestation with fast-growing trees. We compared the assemblages of braconid wasps as parasitoids of taxonomically diverse groups of insects among Imperata grasslands, young and mature plantations of Acacia mangium, young secondary forests after wildfires, and old secondary forests in the lowland of East Kalimantan. The abundance and species richness of braconids, which had declined in Imperata grasslands, somewhat increased in Acacia plantations, and also the species composition of braconids in Acacia plantations was transitional between Imperata grasslands and old secondary forests. Parasitoids of detritivores and wood borers increased markedly after plantation, while those of herbivores showed a distinct turnover of species all over the range from grasslands to old secondary forests. The plantation of A. mangium had most likely facilitated the recovery of the diversity of host forest and their parasitoids, but the recovery was just at the rudimentary stage even in mature plantations. Monitoring of parasitic wasps would be useful to test the continuous recovery of forest biodiversity in plantation stands.

TI  - Evaluating SAR polarization modes at L-band for forest classification purposes in Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Single, interferometric dual, and quad-polarization mode data were evaluated for the characterization and classification of seven land use classes in an area with shifting cultivation practices located in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil). The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat' near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism.

TI  - Land cover mapping of the tropical savanna region in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado), encompassing more than 204 million hectares in the central part of the country, is the second richest biome in Brazil in terms of biodiversity and presents high land use pressure. The objective of this study was to map the land cover of the Cerrado biome based on the segmentation and visual interpretation of 170 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite scenes acquired in 2002. The following land cover classes were discriminated: grasslands, shrublands, forestlands, croplands, pasturelands, reforestations, urban areas, and mining areas. The results showed that the remnant natural vegetation is still covering about 61% of the biome, however, on a highly asymmetrical basis. While natural physiognomies comprise 90% of the northern part of the biome, only 15% are left in its southern portions. Shrublands were the dominant natural land cover class, while pasturelands were the dominant land use class in the Cerrado biome. The final Cerrado's land cover map confirmed the intensive land use pressure in this unique biome. This paper also showed that Landsat-like sensors can provide feasible land cover maps of Cerrado, although ancillary data are required to help image interpretation.

TI  - Intensification of land use in Neotropical environments determines loss of taxonomic and functional diversity of spiders
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and complexity of landscapes can significantly impact the composition and functional traits of spiders, given their strong response to environmental changes. Understanding these effects helps to assess the impact of agricultural practices on spider communities. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of land use and management systems on taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as changes in spider functional traits. Conducted in the eastern and western regions of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, the study focused on land use systems (LUS), including native forest (NF), eucalyptus reforestation (ER), pasture (PA), crop-livestock integration (CLI), and no-tillage (NT). The sampling of the eastern region occurred between July, August and December 2011 and January 2012 and in the western region occurred in April, August 2018. Each collection site represented a sampling station with up to 1 km distance between stations, totaling 888 sampling points. Two collection methods were employed: Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) and pitfall traps. Spider functional diversity was assessed based on eight functional traits. Taxonomic diversity was evaluated through richness, and indices such as FRic, FEve, FDis, FDiv, and CWM were calculated. Generalized linear models (GLMM) were applied to compare the indices. The highest functional and taxonomic richness of spiders was found in native forest (NF). Functional traits, particularly dispersal capacity and stratum preference, showed significant variation across land use systems (LUS), with CLI and PA exhibiting the greatest impacts on functional diversity. The intensity of management practices appears to favor generalist species that are more just more plastic, tolerant and/or dispersive to environmental changes, which could lead to functional biotic homogenization.

TI  - Reforestation processes, seasonality and soil characteristics influence arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dynamics in Araucaria angustifolia forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive logging of Araucaria angustifolia has reduced the extension of Araucaria-dominated forests, causing a strong disturbance on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community. AMF play an important role in soil health and Araucaria forest establishment. However, the main drivers that determine the AMF dynamics in native and reforested areas remain poorly understood. Our study aimed at evaluating important factors (i.e. soil and litter characteristics, seasonality and reforestation practices) that can alter AMF community dynamics. We evaluated three regions of Araucaria forest located in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, including native and reforested sites. We evaluated the AMF community through soil spore extraction and identification and root colonization rates, and we compiled the data using correlations and diversity metrics (richness, abundance and diversity). Together, we recorded thirty-six AMF species during the two sampling periods at all sites. Genera with the greatest numbers of species were Gloms, Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. Soil macroporosity, K and P were always higher in native forests and moisture was higher in reforested sites. Root colonization, though also affected by seasonality, showed differential behavior for each region. In addition, AMF species abundance changed between native and reforested sites and according to the season. In region 1, when correlating AMF and physical-chemical soil and litter attributes in a Redundancy Analysis, there were few differences between native and reforested sites, both being very similar. However, native and reforested sites were clearly discriminated in the other two regions, mainly influenced by bulk density, litter N, pH, Al, total porosity and moisture. The main influence in AMF dynamics composition were litter physical and chemical attributes. However, the reforestation process and seasonality, especially in summer, contributed to discriminate regions, indicating the relevance of these aspects on the AMF profile, reinforcing the importance of integrating tools in the evaluation of the biological data set.

TI  - Effect of flaxseed root performance on the structural quality of a Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal was to evaluate the root development of flaxseed and its relationship with soil aggregation and organic carbon storage in two sowing seasons under soil conservationist management, in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We used three flaxseed genotypes: Aguara and Cabure from Argentina, and Gold from Brazil, sowings in April and May in a no-tillage system under Haplumbrept. In the flowering stage, the root system was evaluated by image analyze using a Safira software. Root distribution maps were used by geostatistical kriging. At the harvest stage, soil blocks were sampled for analyze the aggregates morphometry by image with Quantporo software and the soil organic carbon. Undisturbed soil were sampled to determine the physical attributes. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with three repetitions, anova was performed by Fisher and the means compared by Tukey test. No physical impediments were found for the roots performance in the Haplumbrept under conservationist management system, these favored the irregularity of the aggregates surface observed by the low values of aspect and roughness in the different tested diameter ranges. Both Cabure and Aguara genotypes showed good roots spatial distribution in the soil profile in both sowing seasons with an increase in carbon storage in the smallest diameter aggregates (here considered the aggregates of 4.76-1 mm). Cabure genotype is the best genotype adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions evaluated because had a greater roots volume, area and length below to 0.15 m depth.

TI  - Challenges in the conservation and management of legal reserve areas in Brazilian grassland and savanna ecosystems in the face of global climate change
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Legal reserve areas (ARLs) are a fundamental part of Brazil's conservation strategy, along with permanent preservation areas. ARLs are designed to maintain biodiversity and can be managed sustainably. When these areas are home to fire- and grazing-dependent ecosystems, such as native grasslands and savannas, appropriate management practices must be adopted to conserve them and cope with the effects of global climate change. However, this subject is still little discussed in Brazil, and public policies are unclear in this regard. This review article describes the grassland and savannah ecosystems in Brazil, the legal aspects related to the management of ARLs, current and future climate scenarios, and the relationship between climate and fire risk. It also presents a review of the use of fire and grazing in grassland and savannah ecosystems, the legal challenges related to their application in ARLs and the use of geotechnologies in monitoring these practices. It concludes that grazing and fire, as management tools, are appropriate for the functions of ARLs, provided that they are practiced according to legal and scientifically based standards to avoid the negative effects of their misuse.

TI  - Drone-Based Assessment of Canopy Cover for Analyzing Tree Mortality in an Oil Palm Agroforest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm monocultures are highly productive, but there are widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Some of these negative impacts might be mitigated by mixed-species tree interplanting to create agroforestry systems, but there is little experience with the performance of trees planted in oil palm plantations. We studied a biodiversity enrichment experiment in the lowlands of Sumatra that was established in a 6- to 12-year-old oil palm plantation by planting six tree species in different mixtures on 48 plots. Three years after tree planting, canopy cover was assessed by drone-based photogrammetry using the structure-from-motion technique. Drone-derived canopy cover estimates were highly correlated with traditional ground-based hemispherical photography along the equality line, indicating the usefulness and comparability of the approach. Canopy cover was further partitioned between oil palm and tree canopies. Thinning of oil palms before tree planting created a more open and heterogeneous canopy cover. Oil palm canopy cover was then extracted at the level of oil palms and individual trees and combined with ground-based mortality assessment for all 3,819 planted trees. For three tree species (Archidendron pauciflorum, Durio zibethinus, and Shorea leprosula), the probability of mortality during the year of the study was dependent on the amount of oil palm canopy cover. We regard the drone-based method for deriving and partitioning spatially explicit information as a promising way for many questions addressing canopy cover in ecological applications and the management of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Improving Farming Practices for Sustainable Soil Use in the Humid Tropics and Rainforest Ecosystem Health
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable farming practices such as shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn agriculture in the humid tropics threaten the preservation of the rainforest and the health of the local and global environment. In weathered soils prone to cohesion in humid tropic due to low Fe and carbon content and the enormous amounts of P that can be adsorbed, sustainable soil use is heavily dependent on the availability and efficient use of nutrients. This paper reviews the literature in the field and provides some insights about sustainable soil use in the humid tropics, mainly for the Brazilian Amazonia region. Careful management of organic matter and physical and chemical indicators is necessary to enhance root growth and nutrient uptake. To improve the rootability of the arable layer, a combination of gypsum with continuous mulching to increase the labile organic matter fraction responsible for the formation of a short-lived structure important for root growth is recommended, rather than tillage. Unlike mulching, mechanical disturbance via ploughing of Amazonian soils causes very rapid and permanent soil organic matter losses and often results in permanent recompaction and land degradation or anthropic savannization; thus, it should be avoided. Unlike in other regions, like southeast Brazil, saturating the soil solely with inorganic potassium and nitrogen soluble fertilizers is not recommended. Nutrient retention in the root zone can be enhanced if nutrients are added in a slow-release form and if biologically mediated processes are used for nutrient release, as occurs in green manure. Therefore, an alternative that favors using local resources to increase the supply of nutrients and offset processes that impair the efficiency of nutrient use must be pursued.

TI  - Environmental equity and urban afforestation in the extreme northeastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas with low tree cover in Brazil are found mainly in the Amazon, highlighting the disparities in access to benefits of urban greening. The goal of this study was to analyze how urban afforestation is associated with sociodemographic factors to understand the distribution of trees (and their benefits) among different social segments in the city of Macap & aacute;, in the extreme Northeastern Amazon. We conducted a floristic inventory in 217 blocks belonging to 32 neighborhoods, and classified species according to origin (exotic or native) and fruit use (fruit-bearing or non-fruit-bearing). Additionally, we selected 12 variables to represent sociodemographic gradients among neighborhoods. We reduced the dimensionality of floristic and sociodemographic data using ordination techniques, and used their first axes to represent gradients of species composition and sociodemographic factors. The effect of sociodemographic gradients on tree abundance, species richness and composition was tested using generalized linear models. The results indicate that most urban trees are exotic, non-fruit-bearing, and of medium size (10-30 cm in diameter). Older neighborhoods with higher human population age and income showed higher tree abundance and higher species richness. The species composition was related to the gradient of human population density, proportion of old people, income, and household occupancy. Large non-fruit trees were more frequent in neighborhoods with low population density. Exotic trees were more frequent in older neighborhoods with older people and high income, and large fruit trees showed higher abundance in neighborhoods with low household occupancy rates. Ensuring that low-income neighborhoods and historically marginalized communities have equal access to green spaces and adequate tree coverage is a key element to promote environmental justice and to develop healthier and more sustainable cities.

TI  - Dynamics of soil carbon following destruction of tropical rainforest and the subsequent establishment of Imperata grassland in Indonesian Borneo using stable carbon isotopes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia has the highest rate of tropical rainforest deforestation worldwide, and large deforested areas have been replaced ultimately by the highly invasive grass Imperata cylindrica. However, information on the carbon (C) budget with such land transition is very scarce. This study presents the dynamics of soil C following rainforest destruction and the subsequent establishment of Imperata grassland in the lowland humid tropics of Indonesian Borneo using stable C isotopes. To evaluate the relative contribution of organic matter originating from primary forest (C3) and grasslands (C4), we compared soil C stock and natural 13C abundance from six sites to a depth of 100 similar to cm using samples with a wide range of soil textures. Twelve years after the first soil sampling in the grasslands, we re-sampled to examine temporal changes in soil organic matter. The grassland topsoil (05 similar to cm) is an active layer with rapid decomposition and incorporation of fresh C (mean residence time: 7.5 similar to year) and a substantial proportion of the stable C pool (37%). The decline in forest-derived C was slight, even at 510 similar to cm depths, and subsoil (20100 similar to cm depth) forest-derived C did not change along the forest-to-grassland chronosequence. Grassland-derived C stock increased significantly in the subsurface and subsoils (5100 similar to cm). Simulation indicated that total soil C stock (0100 similar to cm) increased by 18.6 similar to Mg similar to ha-1 from initial primary forest (58.0 similar to Mg similar to ha-1) to a new equilibrium state of the grassland (76.6 similar to Mg similar to ha-1) after 3050 similar to years of grassland establishment. This research indicates that the soil did not function as a CO2 source when the deforested area was replaced by Imperata grassland on the Ultisols of the Asian humid tropics. Instead, increased soil C stocks offset CO2 emissions, with the C offset accounting for 6.67.4% of the loss of biomass C stock.

TI  - Structure, survival, and species diversity in a tropical dry forest submitted to coppicing
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga is a tropical dry forest. Rational exploitation of Caatinga wood resources consists of sustainable forest management under coppice systems. Therefore, the recovery of the timber stock for the next cycle will depend on the regrowth and survival capacity of the exploited species, as well as on the future structure of the forest. The objective of this work was to characterize the survival, structure, and diversity of Caatinga submitted to coppicing under sustainable forest management comparing pre-and post-harvest conditions. Permanent plots were installed in a Caatinga in the municipality of Floresta-PE, Brazil, in 2013, and measured 2 years after clearcutting. Height and circumference at the base (CAB) of the stumps and shoots were obtained for two sit-uations: pre-cut (grouping by live and dead stumps) and (ii) post-cut (shoots on only live stumps). In addition, all individual shrub-tree species (CAB >= 4 cm) not included in the post-cut situation were identified, measured (CAB and height total) and tagged as persisting (6 cm < CAB) or growing (6 < CAB <= 4 cm) in 2015. The survival and mortality of the stumps were quantified, as well as changes in the horizontal structure and floristic diversity. There was a decrease in the number of species 2 years after cutting, mainly due to the loss of Croton rhamnifolius H. B. K. and Sapium glandulatum (Vell.) Pax and predominance of Cenostigma bracteosum (Tul.) E. Gagnon & G. P. Lewis, Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart., and Cnidoscolus quercifolius Pohl., resulting in a greater number of in-dividuals of a few species. The outstanding regrowth capacity of these three species indicates that the forest remnant under study may eventually consist of populations with a predominance of species capable of coppicing.

TI  - Diversity of Collembola and occurrence of Talitroides sylvaticus in a Pinus elliottii Engelm afforestation
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - A 52-year-old pine forest is characterized as an environment with low plant diversity and large accumulation of allelopathic litter with poor nutrient content. Collembola is sensitive to environmental conditions and may have difficulties living in these forests. This study aimed (1) to evaluate the abundance and richness of Collembola in the soil of a 52-year-old pine afforestation with different moisture contents; and (2) to identify the landhopper sampled unintentionally. For sampling, pitfall traps were set up for four days, in areas of a Pinus elliottii afforestation with high and low soil moisture located at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. Collembola specimens were counted and identified to family and genus level. The total abundance of springtails was greater in the low soil moisture area. The genera Desoria and Lepidocyrtus, and specimens of the family Onychiuridae were more abundant in low soil moisture, meanwhile, the genus Ceratophysella was more abundant in the high soil moisture. The landhopper Talitroides sylvaticus was sampled unintentionally by traps set up in the soil with higher moisture and calcium content. Six genera of Collembola and the landhopper T. sylvaticus were identified in soil of a P. elliottii afforestation and their distribution is influenced by soil moisture.

T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating conservation and development is central to the mission of many protected areas in the tropics, yet there is limited empirical evidence on the effectiveness of alternative strategies for ICDPs (Integrated Conservation and Development Projects). We evaluate an enterprise-based conservation strategy in a high-profile and well-funded ICDP in the Tapajos National Forest of Brazil. Using survey data from participating and non-participating households collected pre and post intervention, we find positive impacts on household income, but almost no discernible impacts on household assets, livelihood portfolios, or forest conservation.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical and chemical fractions of soil organic matter (SOM), as well as perform the spectroscopic analysis in ultraviolet-visible humic acid in a Oxisol under no-tillage system (NTS) with different years of implementation, and compare them to areas of native cerrado and pasture. Was evaluated five areas namely: native cerrado (CE), planted pasture (PA) with Brachiaria decumbens; NTS with 3 (NTS 3) years of implementation; NTS with 15 years (NTS 15) of implementation and NTS with more than 20 (NTS 20) years of implementation. The levels and total carbon stocks and humic fractions of SOM, increased with deployment time the NTS at all depths analyzed, with the humic fractions presented the following order: fraction fulvic acid > fraction humic acid > humin fraction. The results showed that depending on the time of implementation of the NTS was observed an increase of more stable fractions of humic substances and physical fractions of SOM, providing greater stability of this system. There is increasing the E4/E6 ratio of humic acids according on the time of implementation of the NTS, demonstrating an increase of aliphatic structures. The area evaluated PA had the lowest concentrations and inventories of humic fractions, carbon associated with minerals (CAM) and E4/E6 ratio, demonstrating to be in an advanced stage of degradation relative to the other areas assessed.

TI  - Conservation of species-rich subtropical grasslands: traditional management vs. legal conservation requirements in primary and secondary grasslands
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is the main cause of biodiversity losses, and for grasslands includes changes in management. The last 10 years has seen afforestation of traditionally grazed grasslands increase considerably in the understudied Serra do Sudeste region of the Brazilian Pampa, turning the region into a mosaic of tree plantations, natural ecosystems (partly in conservation areas without grazing management) and other land uses. We evaluated grassland plant community structure and composition in conservation areas considering two distinct types of land-use history and compared them to grasslands under traditional management. The study was carried out at 58 sites. Per site, three plots were established to sample the plant composition of the herbaceous and shrub layers. We used ordination techniques and indicator species analysis to describe patterns of community composition. We recorded a total of 516 species, thus confirming the high biodiversity of the region. We detected differences in vegetation structure and composition between primary and secondary grasslands. Our study emphasizes the need to increase conservation efforts in the region and points out that current conservation approaches should be evaluated critically regarding their effects for biodiversity conservation and that adequate grazing management is key for grassland biodiversity conservation.

TI  - The fragmented Atlantic rain forest of Brazil: size, shape and distribution of forest fragments
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographical characteristics of a total of 1839 forest fragments surrounded by sugar cane fields were studied in the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest region of the northeastern state of Pernambuco. The size and shape of the fragments as well as inter-fragment distances and the effects of varying edge width were examined using a geographical information system. The analyses show that the fragments are relatively small and close to each other. Approximately 48% of the rain forest fragments are <10 hectares, while only about 7% are >100 hectares. Forest fragments are close to each other, as fragments located 50 m or less apart formed groups that included ca. 50% of the total forest area. At 350 m inter-fragment distance, 98% of the rain forest area was included in groups of fragments. Due to the small size and irregular shape of the fragments, the total area of edge zone exceeds that of the interior habitat when the edge width is ca. 60 m. At an edge width of 300 m ca. 94% of the total fragment area is edge zone. For conservation purposes, ways of establishing networks of forest fragments connected by corridors and stepping stone fragments are demonstrated using GIS. Simulations using these techniques show that reforestation of sugar cane fields between the forest fragments would considerably increase the area of interior forest habitat and connectivity between fragments.

TI  - Long-term effects of tillage systems on liming efficiency, soil chemical properties and wheat yield in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Sustainable management of the soil is one of the pillars of conservation agriculture (CA). Aims The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of soil management systems (SMS) on liming efficiency, soil chemical properties and wheat yield. Methods This study was part of a long-term experiment established in 1986 in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but using data from 2008 to 2015 to explore the effects of agricultural lime applied in 2008. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design where the main plot (SMS) were arranged in randomised blocks and the cropping systems (sub-plot treatments) were randomised within the main plots. This study assessed the effects of the SMS; i.e. two CA systems [no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage] and two conventional tillage (CT) systems (disk ploughing + disk harrowing annually, and mouldboard ploughing + disk harrowing annually). Key results The NT system was the most sustainable due to improvements in soil organic carbon concentration. After liming, CT systems were more effective than CA systems in decreasing Al3+ toxicity and increasing soil pH and Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations at deeper soil layers. The NT system had a considerable advantage over other SMS, due to a greater average wheat yield (18%). Conclusions The SMS evaluated in this study modified chemical properties when compared with the native forest area. The NT system was the least detrimental to soil organic carbon, an important indicator of soil quality. Implications The NT system provided greater average wheat yield (18%), and thus was the most viable SMS for subtropical spring wheat production.

TI  - Patterns of mistletoe infestation in neotropical urban areas
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mistletoes occur in tropical and temperate ecosystems all over the world. In urban areas mistletoes can become weedy and affect the health of cultivated trees. In this study we sought to detect patterns of infestation at tree, species, and community level, in order to support improvements in urban tree planting policies. Field studies were performed in Fortaleza, CE, Brazil. The trees and their mistletoes were surveyed in four green areas to examine the relationship between the severity of the infestation and tree attributes (trunk diameter, nativeness, and distance to the nearest infested tree). We evaluated the prevalence, the severity, and the preference ratio (PR) of each tree species according to their respective abundance. We also compiled data from other studies carried out in different cities in the Neotropical region, between 20o N (Mexico) and 32o S (Southern Brazil), to evaluate the relationships between prevalence and three urban tree community attributes (tree species richness, % of exotic trees, and tree density). Due to the high number of independent variables analyzed and their non-normal distribution, we used the Generalized Linear Mixed Model approach (GLMM) and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between all mentioned variables and mistletoe indicators. We were able to generate models with significant estimates for prevalence and severity of mistletoe infestation. We evaluated the GLMM through the AIC, the BIC, and the dispersion parameter. We also found significant correlation coefficients between prevalence/severity and all independent variables (except for tree density). We found that bigger trees and those near to previous infestations tend to be more infested. Exotic species showed higher PR, higher prevalence, and higher severity. At the community level we found that a high tree species richness and a low percentage of exotic trees are associated with a low prevalence of mistletoes. Our results bring a new point of view to urban forestry, urban ecology, and management of urban green areas. We propose that tree planting in urban areas should aim for high diversity with a low percentage of exotics.

TI  - Impact of long-term no-tillage and cropping system management on soil organic carbon in an Oxisol: A model for sustainability
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) was assessed in a long-term (19 yr) experiment comparing conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) management systems and various winter cover crop treatments in a Rhodic Hapludox in southern Brazil. After 19 yr, NT resulted in 6.84 Mg C ha(-1), in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), which represented 64.6% more than CT. In the 0 to 20 cm soil layer, the NT system sequestered 1.24 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), while CT sequestered 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Independent of soil management, the fallow treatment resulted in the lowest SOC stocks to the 40-cm soil depth compared to all other winter treatments. We compared SOC levels of the experimental site with a nearby-forested area, which has never been cleared. No-till management combined with winter cover crops resulted in soil properties that most closely resembled the undisturbed forest. Maize grain yields and soybean seed yields were 6 and 5% higher, respectively, under NT than CT. Our results point to NT management combined with winter cover crops as the management system of choice to achieve sustainable crop production on Oxisols in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world.

TI  - Soil organic carbon dynamics following afforestation of degraded pastures with eucalyptus in southeastern Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation of degraded pastures can potentially enhance carbon sequestration, but little is known about the effects of eucalyptus plantations on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. We used density and particle size SOM fractionations to evaluate changes in SOM for a chronosequence of eucalyptus plantations established on degraded pastures in two contrasting regions in southeastern Brazil. Declines in the content of soil C derived from the pasture (C4 photosynthetic pathway) and the accumulation of that derived from the eucalyptus (C3 photosynthetic pathway) were followed through 13 C natural abundance of the SOM. The two study areas were in the Rio Doce River Valley, Minas Gerais State, namely: 1, Belo Oriente (BO, a region with lower elevation, higher mean annual temperature, lower forest productivities and dominated by clayey Typic Haplustoxs); 2, Virginopolis (VG, a region of higher elevation, higher forest productivities and dominated by clayey Rhodic Ustoxs). In the BO region the chronosequence included 0, 4.2, 13.2, 22.2, 32.0 and 34.2 years of eucalyptus cultivation and in the VG region soils were cultivated with eucalyptus for 0, 8.2, 19.2, 29.2 and 33.2 years. The accumulated cultivation time corresponds to about five rotations. In both regions the initial soil condition was represented by a site that was still under pasture. Soil samples collected at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths were analyzed for: total organic carbon (TOC); C in the fulvic (FAF), humic (HAF) and humin (HF) fractions; C in the free (FLF) and occluded (OLF) light fractions; C associated with the heavy fractions, namely, the sand (SF), silt plus clay (S + CF) and clay (CF) fractions; and C in the microbial biomass (MB). Carbon stocks of virtually all SOM fractions were about twice as high in the VG region than in the BO region. Eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region increased C stocks in all SOM fractions, except for the MB fraction that was not altered and the SF fraction that declined with time of eucalyptus cultivation. Increases in TOC, FAF and HF organic C fractions were observed in the VG region. Mean annual accumulations across the entire cultivation period in the 0-10 cm soil layer showed virtually no difference averaging 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the BO region and 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the VG region. However, gains of TOC peaked by the end of the third rotation in the BO region and the second rotation in the VG region, so the TOC accumulation rate during the respective aggrading periods would correspond to 0.35 and 0.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). There was no clear evidence that the more labile, fast cycling SOM fractions were more sensitive indicators of the impact of eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region, whereas in the VG region the FLF and OLF were more sensitive to the land use change than TOC.

TI  - RICHNESS AND FLORISTIC COMPOSITION OF THE FERN COMMUNITY IN RIPARIAN FOREST OF THE RIVER 'CADEIA', IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzed richness and specific composition of the fern community in fragments from the riparian forest of river 'Cadeia', under different levels of human impact, in Santa Maria do Herval, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. An amount of 120 sample units were delimited, equitably distributed in three fragments (FI, II and III) in which all species were surveyed and the richness was recorded. The floristic composition among fragments was compared using Jaccard's index and spatial distribution of units was evaluated through multidimensional scaling. Richness data were presented in the form of rarefaction curves based on samples and non-parametric diversity estimators. A total of 40 species were found, belonging to 13 families. The greater floristic similarity was between FI and FII. Sample units from FI formed the most defined grouping and they had more exclusive species than the others. The rarefaction curve for the total sampling almost reached the asymptote and estimators indicated a maximum of 45 species, which means that the majority of species was surveyed at the study site. A decreasing gradient of mean richness per unit was observed as the urbanization increased in the matrix habitat of the fragments. These results form a data base to be used in management, conservation and reforestation measures in degraded riparian forests. They can be directly compared to results from other studies that used rarefaction and richness estimators, which is not possible to do with many of the surveys accomplished in Brazil so far.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION IN FOREST REMAINDERS AND REFORESTED AREAS OF "MOGI-GUACU" RIVER FLOODPLAIN IN LUIZ ANTONIO COUNTY, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The phytosociology of the woody stratum of both young regenerating individuals and seed banks are quality indicators of heterogeneous reforestations. The objetive of this research was to evaluate the structure of regeneration of the arboreal species in two natural remainders, in three areas reforested with native species and in a Eucalyptus robusta settlement located in a floodplain of Mogi-Guacu river in Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31 'S and 47 degrees 55 'W), Sao Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was collected in 40 subplots of 2 m(2) in of each natural remainder and each eucalyptus sub-forest, as well as 60 subplots of 3.5 m(2) in each area reforested. All individuals with height 3 10 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5.0 cm were measured and analyzed separately in four height classes according to floristic diversity, similarity, density, frequency, dominance, importance value and natural regeneration. A total of 2,010 individuals were identified, belonging to 24 families, 46 genera and 51 species. The species with greater importance values were Cabralea canjerana, Psidium cattleyanum, Nectandra megapotamica, Acacia polyphylla and Syzygium cumini, well represented in the four height classes. Reforestation with native species in a degraded Mogi-Guacu River floodplain promoted natural regeneration with more biodiversity than in natural remainders submitted to border effect, and contributed to the forest ecosystem restoration process. The 20-year-old Eucalyptus robusta plantation promoted the regeneration of climax and secondary species.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Workshop on Biological Management of Soil Ecosystems
CL  - Londrina, BRAZIL
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversitythe activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures.

TI  - Carbon neutral? No change in mineral soil carbon stock under oil palm plantations derived from forest or non-forest in Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability criteria for palm oil production guide new planting toward non-forest land cover on mineral soil, avoiding carbon debts caused by forest and peat conversion. Effects on soil carbon stock (soil C-stock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil C-stock (Mg ha(-1)), soil bulk density (BD, g cm(-3)) and soil organic carbon concentration (C-org, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Core (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in C-org (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil C-stock in the top 30 cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil C-stock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil C-stock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation.

T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stocks in soil macroaggregates are related to the rate of soil C sequestration in no-tillage system. This study aimed to evaluate carbon stocks in macroaggregates (12.5 to 19.0mm) as a function of the occasional tillage and/or liming of a Hapludox loamy clayey under no-tillage for 17 years in Pato Branco, Parana southwest, Brazil. Starting from October 2009, it was evaluated an experiment with split-split plots, with plots as sampling dates after 6, 12 and 20 months of the occasional tillage and/or liming; the subplots as soil management, with and without occasional soil tillage with plowing and disking; and as sub-subplots, liming levels, with and without limestone to raise the base saturation index to 70%. From 6 to 12 months, the limestone application on surface or incorporated increased C stocks of macroaggregates in the 0.10-0.20m layer After 20 months, the incorporation of limestone in soil reduced C stocks in macmaggregates only in the 0-0.10m layer Thus, the surface liming is essential for the maintenance and enhancement of C stocks in macroaggregates of no-tillage system, keeping it consolidated.

TI  - Ecophysiology parameters of four Brazilian Atlantic Forest species under shade and drought stress
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has experienced a reduction in its original area since the discovery of Brazil. Over the last 30 years, studies and techniques for forest recovery have advanced. Establishing a self-sustainable reforested area with adequate biodiversity is the main parameter for any reforestation program. Thus, knowledge of the ecophysiological behavior of the species to be used is crucial. Our hypothesis is that certain tools are efficient in determining the ecophysiological characterization of native species within different functional groups. Filling group plants show fast growth, intense gas exchange, present mechanisms of water deficit tolerance and show high efficiency in radiation capture, so they are first planted in a reforestation area. While plants pertaining to the diversity group do not exhibit these characteristics, thus are plants after the establishment of the first group of species. To test this hypothesis, two experiments were installed using young plants of four species native to the Atlantic Forest, grown in 9-L pots. Leaf water potential, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and certain biochemical parameters of leaf metabolism were evaluated. In the first experiment, plants were maintained under two forms of light availability for 15 days, full light (control) and shaded (shade). The species Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis presented the most contrasting responses on day 15, principally in the variables leaf water potential, gas exchange, leaf soluble sugar content, F-v'/F-m' and F-v/F-m. In the second experiment, plants were divided into two groups: a well-hydrated group (control) and one that underwent irrigation suspension for 7 days (drought); measurements were performed on day 8 of drought. Again, Inga sp. and Brosimum guianensis plants showed responses characterizing them as pertaining to distinct functional groups for the experimental parameters previously described. Thus, Inga sp. was classified as pertaining to the filling group and B. guianensis to the diversity group. The performance of the species Cinnamomum zeylancium and Tapirira guianensis under the conditions studied suggests that these are intermediate species with potential for use as filling group species.

TI  - Soybean expansion impacts on soil organic matter in the eastern region of the Maranhao State (Northeastern Brazil)
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the eastern region of the Maranhao state (Northeastern Brazil) became a hotspot of land-use change (LUC) directly from native vegetation to soybean cultivation, but due to the soil characteristics, LUC has caused substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen depletion. Therefore, we quantified these impacts arising from two factors: (i) different timeframes after LUC and (ii) contrasting soil management practices. For the first study, soil samples (0-30 cm; six replicates) were taken on soybean fields year one, year eight and 15 years after LUC. It the second study, another area was sampled, of which part was managed under no-tillage (NT) and the other using a mouldboard plough (MP). For both studies, native vegetation (NV) was sampled as the control. NV stored about 50 Mg of carbon (C) ha(-1); but LUC reduced C stocks by 35% (after 8 and 15 years); moreover, labile-C decreased between 20% and 45%, while, microbial-C decreased between 20% and 60%, considering the interval between year one and 15 years. Regarding soil management, the MP did not cause differences on C stock (24 Mg C ha(-1)) in comparison to NT; however, both labile-C and microbial-C decreased by 15% to NT, while, decreased by 40% to MP. These results lead us to believe that, since LUC is inevitable, we suggested the adoption of the best agricultural management practices, in order to preserve/increase the SOC, reducing the impacts on GHG emissions and, thus, achieving sustainability and profitability.

TI  - Comparative herbaceous phytosociology in agroforestry and Calophyllum brasiliense monoculture on a river terrace
T2  - REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive forage grasses, especially the Urochloa genus, impact reforestation worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate management influence on phytosociology of the herbaceous layer, defined as the layer of herbs, sub-shrubs, shrubs and vines, in two agroforestry systems (AFS) (Simple and Biodiverse) in succession to a reforestation of guanandi (Calophyllum brasiliense), compared to monoculture of this specie taken as control. The experiment was conducted in Pindamonhanga (SP), Brazil, from 2011 to 2014, in a randomized block design with eight replications and 144.0 m(2) plots. In Simple SAF area, food crops were grown alongside C. brasiliense rows: sweet cassava (Manihot esculenta) in rotation with arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), banana shrub (Musa sp.), and jugara palm (Euterpe edulis). In Biodiverse AFS, fourteen native tree species were also planted alongside the food crops. Altogether 41 herbaceous layer species, 38 genera and 24 botanical families were identified; the most abundant families were: Asteraceae, Poaceae e Cyperaceae. The similarity between the areas diverged after three years of management, with the predominance of Commelina benghalensis and M. arundinacea in the AFS areas and Urochloa decumbens in the monocultive, mainly, due to the shadow gradient established for the three systems.

TI  - Carbon storage and root penetration in deep soils under small-farmer land-use systems in the Eastern Amazon region, Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The north-east of Para state in the Eastern Amazon of Brazil was settled over 100 years ago. Today the region is an agricultural landscape with variously-aged secondary vegetation and fields with annual cultures, plantation crops and pastures. The effect of these different land covers on carbon sequestration as well as on water and nutrient extraction remain subject of debate. Therefore, we assessed the importance of land use on soil carbon stocks by measuring various C fractions and root biomass (0-6 m) in slash-and-burn systems and (semi-) permanent cultures. An extensive root system down to at least 6 m depth was present under various secondary vegetation stands and slashed and burned fields recently taken into cultivation as well as under a primary forest. Shallower rooting patterns were evident under (permanent) oil palm (4.5 m) and (semi-permanent) passion fruit plantations (2.5 m). Carbon storage in soils of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture up to 6 m depth (185 t ha(-1)) was not significantly lower than under a primary forest (196 t ha(-1)) but declined significantly under (semi-) permanent cultures (to 146-167 t ha(-1)). Compared to above-ground C losses, soil C losses due to slash-and-burn agriculture may thus be small. This is an argument for maintaining the secondary vegetation as part of the agricultural land-use system, as the root system of its trees is conserved and thus C is sequestered also at greater depth.

TI  - Long Term of Soil Carbon Stock in No-Till System Affected by a Rolling Landscape in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 1960s, a conservationist agricultural practice known as a "no-tillage system" was adopted. Several benefits such as soil erosion reduction and soil carbon sequestration, among others, could be ascribed to no-till systems. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the long-term sustainability of this agricultural system in different environments. This study has the objective to evaluate the soil organic carbon dynamic in a no-till system (40-year) and on a rolling landscape in Southern Brazil. A systematic grid with four transversal-longitudinal transects was used for soil sampling. Soil samples from 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depths were collected (16 trenches x 3 depths x 1 sample per soil layer = 48), and a forest nearby was used as control (4 trenches x 3 depths x 1 sample = 12). The soil at the forest site showed 20% more carbon stock than no-till at the 0-20 cm soil depth. However, the entire no-till soil profile (0-60 cm) showed similar soil carbon as forest soil. The soil carbon stock (0-20 cm) in no-till was depleted at a rate of 0.06 kg C m(-2) year(-1), summing up to a carbon loss of 2.43 kg C m(-2). In addition, the non-uniform hillslope affected the soil carbon redistribution through the landscape, since the convex hillslope was more depleted in carbon by 37% (15.87 kg C m(-2)) when compared to the concave sector (25.27 kg C m(-2)). On average, the soil carbon loss in the subtropical agroecosystem was much lower than those reported in literature, as well as our initial expectations. In addition, the no-till system was capable of preserving soil carbon in the deepest soil layers. However, presently, the no-till system is losing more carbon in the topsoil at a rate greater than the soil carbon input.

TI  - Soil organic matter dynamics and soil carbon stocks from tropical and sub-tropical areas under no-till: An on-farm research
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization is fundamental to soil carbon sequestration and reduction of greenhouse gas emission (GEE), playing a pivotal role in the soil carbon cycle. Soil samples were collected from 1-meter trenches in no-till systems and compared to native vegetation, totalizing 256 samples from commercial farms in the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, and Pampa Brazilian biomes. Soil fractionation (>53 mu m and < 53 <mu>m), laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS), and delta C-13 isotopic analysis were employed to investigate SOM dynamics and their relationships with soil carbon stocks. SOM presents chemical compounds more susceptible to decomposition in the surface, increasing its recalcitrance in deeper layers. Over 90 % of soil carbon is in the < 53 mu m fraction, indicating organo-mineral association as the major SOM stabilization mechanism. However, in a minor extension physical protection by soil aggregation, can play a role in SOM stabilization. H-LIFS from < 53 mu m fraction demonstrated that SOM in these agricultural areas contains more labile compounds than in native vegetation areas, indicating recently incorporated less transformed organic material. Farms 2 and 4 (Cerrado) showed increases in carbon stocks in agricultural areas compared to native vegetation of 89 Mg C ha(-1) and 24 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, with distinct delta C-13 patterns. Farm 1 (Atlantic Forest) presented a reduction of 59 Mg C ha(-1), primarily due to land use change, from native vegetation to agriculture. Farm 3 (Pampa) maintained its carbon stock, with no differences in delta C-13 patterns. These findings provide valuable insights into SOM stabilization for carbon sequestration, and the benefits of conservationist management practices, emphasizing the importance of generate data from on-farm research experiments. Measurements from agricultural and native vegetation areas in on-farm research across commercial farms provide real-field data to optimize protocols and support good management practices for enhancing soil carbon sequestration in tropical regions.

TI  - Monitoring the rewilding of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest on tree and mammal diversity: From a biodiversity hotspot to a biodiversity hopespot
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of rewilding initiatives is crucial for biodiversity recovery, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Long-term monitoring of rewilding initiatives is critical for assessing progress and informing management choices. This study assesses the efficiency of different reforestation practices for biodiversity recovery, including passive restoration, active reforestation with different native seedlings, and plantations of exotic species. We applied an ecosystem approach to estimate the tree and mammal diversity, collected through forest plots and camera traps. We selected differently managed areas and included the oldest forest patches as reference points for the assessment of biodiversity; a naturally disturbed montane forest in the area was included as a control category for the disturbance analysis. Moreover, we investigated the influence of ecological variables, such as biodiversity, aboveground biomass, and altitude, on rewilding processes. Our results suggest that Eucalyptus plantations, a simplified ecosystem made up of monocultures of exotic species, support lower biodiversity. On the contrary, active reforestation with different native species resulted in an ecological status comparable to naturally regrown secondary forests. We show that active reforestation can reduce the time required for rewilding. We also found a positive correlation between tree and mammal species richness. These results underscore the importance and potential of responsible restoration efforts in recovering local biodiversity, contributing to the vision of a future where the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can be acknowledged not only as a biodiversity hotspot but also as a "hopespot."

TI  - Tillage effects on particulate and mineral-associated organic matter in two tropical Brazilian soils
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two Ferralsols (350 and 600 g kg -1 clay) from the Brazilian Cerrado Region were evaluated for long-term effects (5 and 8 years) of no tillage on carbon (C) stocks in particulate (>53 mu m) and mineral-associated ((< 53 mu m) soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. Carbon stocks in particulate SOM increased under no tillage compared with conventional tillage, and the rate was higher in the clayey soil (0.6 2Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in the sandy clay loam soil (0.31 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). In contrast, the mineral-associated SOM in the top soil layer ( 0 - 20 cm) was not affected by tillage system. Sequestration of atmospheric C in tropical no-tillage soils seems to be due to accumulation of C in labile SOM fractions, with highest rates in clayey soils probably due to physical protection.

TI  - Grass vs. tree origin of soil organic carbon under different land-use systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral management of tree plantations is becoming popular in Brazil. The impact of this practice on carbon dynamics of these soils is unknown, and predicting it is difficult because historical land-use records of the region do not exist. The objective of the study was to quantify the relative soil organic carbon (SOC) contributions of C3 and C4 plants in different land-use system.We evaluated total delta 13C, the contribution of C4 and C3-derived soil organic C in three fraction-size classes of soils in six land-use systems (Eucalyptus hybrid plantations established in 1985 and 2005; a native forest; silvopasture stands of Brachiaria brizantha under eucalyptus established in 1994 and 2004; and an open pasture), and undertook carbon dating (C-14) for three of those systems, an Oxisol in Minas Gerais, Brazil. From each system, soil samples were collected from four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm); samples were fractionated into 250-2000, 53-250, and < 53 mu m size classes, and their delta 13C determined. Carbon dating (C-14 analysis) was done for whole soil samples from 0 to 10 cm and 50-100 cm depth classes of three land-use systems.The delta 13C values increased (showing increase in C contribution by C4 plants, i.e., grasses) with soil depth at all sites and all size-classes. The older systems showed a higher contribution of C4-derived SOC at all depths. Carbon dating indicated that the area had been cleared about 300 years ago.Silvopastoral and pasture systems can be considered as good carbon sinks. We infer that the study site was grassland with high proportion of C4 plants in the past, not a forest as it is today.

TI  - Reduced-impact logging and temporal activity of understorey bats in lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Because global timber demands continue to threaten tropical rain forests, identification of sustainable-use forest management protocols that meet human needs while preserving biodiversity is critical. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) protocols are increasingly common in the tropics and may be a viable option for sustainable forest use; however, few studies have documented faunal responses to RIL. Moreover, evaluations of abundance or diversity may not be sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of faunal responses to human activities, especially in the short-term. We assessed the effects of RIL on the temporal activity patterns of abundant bats in lowland Amazonian rain forest. More specifically, we characterized temporal patterns of activity, overlap of temporal activity, and dispersion of activity modes for seven abundant bat species and for four common bat guilds in RIL forest and in undisturbed forest in Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil. Temporal activity of aerial insectivores, nectarivores, and gleaning animalivores did not change in response to RIL. In contrast, three of five species of frugivores and frugivores as a group changed their patterns of temporal activity in response to RIL. RIL had a greater effect on temporal activity of frugivores that foraged in the understorey than on frugivores that foraged in multiple forest strata. Overlap of temporal activity of frugivores was greater than expected by chance in undisturbed forest, but was random in RIL forest. Changes in activity may be a response to a combination of increased predation risk and reduced distances of early evening flights between day roosts and feeding areas in RIL forest compared to undisturbed forest.

TI  - Corn root and soil health indicator response to no-till production practices
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop production guidelines in Brazil currently focus on soil fertility or chemical indicators (i.e., soil pH and nutrient availability) but often neglect physical and biological aspects of soil health. No-tillage (NT) practices have been widely adopted in Brazil primarily to mitigate erosion, but chemical-based guidelines associated with those practices may be contributing to nutrient stratification and a concentration of crop roots within the top few centimeters of the soil profile. Our objective was to quantify relationships between soil physical and chemical attributes and root growth in soils with a long-term NT history (> 10-yr). Crop root development and several soil health indicators were measured within the 0 to 7-, 7- to 17- and 20- to 30-cm depth increments of two long-term NT studies on Rhodic Hapludox soils in Brazil. Data from both experiments showed strong organic carbon (OC) stratification, significant differences in soil physical and chemical attributes, and root systems that were concentrated within the surface layer. Soil compaction below 7-cm appeared to be the dominant factor limiting root growth. Soil-test phosphorus (P) and OC were also correlated to root growth. Based on these analyses and other on-farm observations, we concluded that it is important to recognize that despite its benefits, NT practices can result in plant root stratification. Therefore, it is important to not only monitor soil fertility/chemical conditions, but also soil structure and biological indicators of soil health when developing NT guidelines for Brazil.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL

CP  - 28th Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists
CL  - Sao Paulo, BRAZIL
AB  - During the past four decades, the Mauritian sugar industry has experienced a decreasing trend in cane productivity partly attributed to deterioration of soil health. Development of new cropping systems (NCS) with emphasis on reduced tillage, controlled traffic through adoption of dual-row spacing, and inclusion of a leguminous fallow break crop between two crop cycles has been proposed as a remedial measure to reduce the decline in soil health. Since 2007, field trials have been conducted in different agro-climatic zones to compare the NCS to the conventional planting method. Cane yields obtained in plant and ratoon cane showed some beneficial effects of the new practices. Yield increase tended to result from an additive effect of each new practice. Cane yield after a legume fallow break was also found to be equivalent or higher than in the conventional planting method despite no N fertiliser application in plant cane and only 50% of required N application for the first ratoon crop. The trials are being pursued to assess other possible advantages as well as any constraints of the NCS.

TI  - The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vital role of forests in limiting the likelihood of dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial identification of lost-and-found carbon hotspots at Javanese rice systems, Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Agricultural landscapes play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. The presence of trees outside forests has been recognized as a significant carbon pool, but it is crucial to acknowledge that these trees serve purposes beyond being a carbon sink. This study focuses on integrating border trees and home gardens as distinct land use classes in Indonesian Javanese agricultural land to assess their impact on carbon stock potential and biodiversity connections.OBJECTIVE: The objective is to classify and quantify the tree composition of these classes, estimate their carbon stock potential, analyze plant species diversity, and identify the ecological connections between home gardens and field borders.METHODS: To achieve this, high-resolution multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar images were used from four sampling areas covering 100 km2 each in Lamongan and Malang districts, East Java, Indonesia, for land cover/land use mapping. The land use function method was used to identify border trees and home gardens as separate land use classes. Carbon stock potential was estimated based on tree cover composition, while plant species diversity was analyzed through field surveys and farmer focus group discussions.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Crops with border trees cover approximately 28% to 48% of the cropland area in the study sites, while home gardens represent about 74% to 85% of the settlement area. This suggests a potential to double tree presence in these sites by adopting border trees and home gardens practices across the entire area. The median tree cover ratio was around 27% for border trees and 33% for home gardens. This stratification approach identified 31% to 50% more carbon stock compared to calculations using standard classes. Furthermore, home gardens and border trees show a positive correlation with species richness, indicating their role as keepers of biodiversity. Therefore, home gardens and border trees could serve as a sustainability indicator for agricultural land in the Javanese farm system.SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and climate change mitigation. The stratification approach of identifying border trees and home gardens offers a cost-effective approach for the better computation of carbon stock and can lead to effective land use policies and conservation measures that promote ecological resilience. The study provides valuable insights for similar agricultural contexts worldwide, guiding efforts toward a more sustainable agricultural future.

TI  - NATURAL REGENERATION OF TREE SPECIES IN A MOUNTAIN SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST DOMAIN, IN VICOSA, MG STATE, SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to analyse the tree species natural regeneration floristic composition in a Mountain Seasonal Semideciduous Forest fragment in the domain of the Atlantic Forest, in southeastern Brazil (20 degrees 45'S, 42 degrees 55'W) in order to subsidize secondary natural forest management. Ten sites were selected based on their aspects, slopes and topographic positions. Natural regeneration indexes were estimated for each tree species per size classes to obtain the Total Natural Regeneration Index (TNR) for each species. It was sampled a total of 3,516 individuals of 140 tree species varying from 10 cm to 5 m height with diameter at the height of 1.3 m (DBH) smaller than 5 cm. The largest numbers of individuals were sampled in the families Rubiaceae, Fabaceae Mimosoideae, Monimiaceae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, and the richest families were Fabaceae Caesalpinoideae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Psychotria sessilis, Siparuna guianensis, Anadenanthera peregrina and Piptadenia gonoacantha presented the largest TNR. The comparison of the actual regeneration study with that of prior evaluations suggests a continuous substitution of species from initial to more advanced stages. These results indicate that the protection of the remaining forest fragments is important to maintain or improve the biodiversity in this region.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION, INTRODUCTION PATHWAY, AND INVASION RISK ANALYSIS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS CLARKII (DECAPODA: CAMBARIDAE) IN SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports new records of Procambarus clarkii Girard, 1852 in Southeastern Brazil and investigates its possible pathways of introduction. The Brazilian crayfish pet trade was surveyed with regard to species' availability and price, reporting its persistence, even though illegal. An invasion risk analysis was performed by applying a protocol developed specifically to invasive freshwater invertebrates (FI-ISK). Procambarus clarkii has confirmed occurrences from urban and non-urban areas in the state of Sao Paulo, including the Jaragua State Park, an Atlantic Forest conservation area. The pet trade is an important introduction vector but some subsequent translocation can also be due to the release of live bait by anglers. Besides passive dispersal, these newly discovered populations, especially those located in non-urban areas, are likely to naturally disperse further through active spread and river drift of juveniles. Although confirmed colonized areas are all located in the state of Sao Paulo, the invasive risk analysis showed that P. clarkii is a potential highly invasive species for Brazil. These introductions have unknown consequences; however, many impacts are associated with this species establishment around the world, underlining the urgency to understand the invasion process in Brazil and develop efficient management techniques.

TI  - Does conservation agriculture deliver climate change mitigation through soil carbon sequestration in tropical agro-ecosystems?
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA), comprising minimum soil disturbance, retention of crop residues and crop diversification, is widely promoted for reducing soil degradation and improving agricultural sustainability. It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Agroforestry Systems in Degraded Landscapes in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - When restoring degraded landscapes, approaches capable of striking a balance between improving environmental services and enhancing human wellbeing need to be considered. Agroforestry is an important option for restoring degraded land and associated ecosystem functions. Using survey, key informant interview and rapid carbon stock appraisal (RaCSA) methods, this study was conducted in five districts in West Java province to examine potential carbon stock in agroforestry systems practiced by smallholder farmers on degraded landscapes. Six agroforestry systems with differing carbon stocks were identified: gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) + cardamom (Amomum compactum); manglid (Magnolia champaca (L.) Baill. ex Pierre) + cardamom; caddam (Neolamarckiacadamba (Roxb.) Bosser) + cardamom; caddam + elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.); mixed-tree + fishpond; and mixed-tree lots. Compared to other systems, mixed-tree lots had the highest carbon stock at 108.9 Mg ha(-1). Carbon stock variations related to species density and diversity. Farmers from research sites said these systems also prevent soil erosion and help to restore degraded land. Farmers' adoption of agroforestry can be enhanced by the implementation of supportive policies and measures, backed by scientific research.

TI  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND NUTRIENT RESERVES UNDER DIFFERENT LAND USE SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the contribution of agroforestry (AFS) and traditional systems to carbon sequestration and nutrient reserves in plants, litter and soil. The study was carried out in the semiarid region of Brazil in a long-term experiment on an experimental farm of the goat and sheep section of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Two agroforestry systems were investigated: agrosilvopastoral (ASP) and forest-pasture areas (SP) as well as traditional agriculture management (TM), two areas left fallow after TM (six fallow years - F6 and nine fallow years - F9) and one area of preserved Caatinga vegetation (CAT). Soil, litter and plants were sampled from all areas and the contents of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg per compartment determined. The AFS (ASP and SP) had higher nutrient stocks than the traditional and intermediate stocks compared to the preserved Caatinga. In the ASP, a relevant part of the nutrients extracted by crops is returned to the system by constant inputs of litter, weeding of herbaceous vegetation and cutting of the legume crops. After fallow periods of six and nine years, carbon and nutrient stocks in the compartments soil, litter and herbaceous plants were similar to those of the preserved Caatinga (CAT), but still lower than under natural conditions in the woody vegetation.

TI  - Analysis of Forest Fire Dynamics, Distribution and Main Drivers in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire susceptibility of the Atlantic Forest has largely increased over the past two decades due to a combination of climate change and anthropogenic factors such as land cover change and human modification. High rates of forest fragmentation have contributed to escalating fires in this imperilled global biodiversity hotspot. Understanding fire patterns is essential to developing an effective forest fire management strategy. In this research, we utilized the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach for identifying the role of climatic and anthropogenic factors in influencing fire occurrence probability and mapping the spatial distribution of fire risk. We found that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index value and climate variables (i.e., temperature and solar radiation) were significant drivers of fire occurrence risk. Results also confirm that forest fragmentation increases with fire density in the region.

AB  - Economic growth has led to tremendous environmental changes including resulted pollution, overexploitation of natural resources (biodiversity), converted land/sea (reclamation) and increasing carbon emissions. How developing countries have ability to manage climate change impacts as committed in international climate agreement such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), UNFCCC, COP 21 and so on, is important to be analyzed. As middle income countries, most developing countries (such as Indonesia) have already dealed with other various issues - political, economic, social, etc - in which most government put their priorities and allocate most of their resources to solve those challenges. It is critical to provide policy framework on adaptation and mitigation of climate change impact to strengthen national resilience. As conceptual paper this study aims to analyse the policy governance that integrate the perspective of social and economic issues to address the impacts of climate change on particular case. By exploring global issues of multi level perspectives, this paper provides several propositions for policy makers to strengthen the key strategic policy in national and local contexts of climate change challenges.

TI  - HERB RECOVERY IN DEGRADED CAATINGA SITES ENRICHED WITH NATIVE TREES
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Herb recovery was evaluated in degraded Caatinga sites protected from grazing and enriched with native trees, in Patos-PB state, Brazil. Treatments were randomized according to a block design with five treatments (no tree planting -T-0- or tree planting of three tree species in pure -T-1=Poincianella pyramidalis, T-2=Mimosa tenuiflora and T-3=Cnidoscolus quercifolius - or mixed balanced stands -T4) and five replications of squared-144-m(2) plots with 36 seedlings developing in planting holes enriched with manure and chemical fertilizers, arranged in a 2 m x 2 m grid. Data were collected from September 2008 to October 2009. After this period, natural tree regeneration was still not observed, and tree canopy covered 15 to 49% of the soil and did not affect herb growth and species composition. Initial and final herb cover were 16% and 100%, respectively. The number of dicot herbs increased from five, mainly two Sida species, to 13 species, monocots were represented by one species only (Aristida sp.), and quantity of herb forage reached 3 ton/ha (2:1, dicot: monocot). Adjacent overgrazed plots kept the initial low level of herb cover and species composition. Animal deferment during one year allowed the increase in soil cover and plant diversity in degraded Caatinga sites into which planted tree seedlings established successfully. This management practice could be implemented to avoid further environmental degradation and recover degraded areas.

TI  - Mapping the World's Intact Forest Landscapes by Remote Sensing
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protection of large natural forest landscapes is a highly important task to help fulfill different international strategic initiatives to protect forest biodiversity, to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to stimulate sustainable forest management practices. This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km(2). We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems ( forest zone) to be 13.1 million km(2) or 23.5% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3%) and Boreal Forests (43.8%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them-Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9% has some form of protection, but only 9.7% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data. All project results and IFL maps are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).

TI  - Human activities and forest fires in Indonesia: An analysis of the Bromo incident and implications for conservation tourism
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study delves into the Bromo magnitude of the fire incident in Indonesia, a notable tourism destination, uncovering significant gaps in knowledge regarding tourist-induced forest fires. We comprehensively analyze the incident's environmental, economic, social, and tourism impacts. Environmentally, the fire caused severe damage to the region's ecosystems, upsetting ecological balances and diminishing air quality. This has farreaching effects on flora, fauna, and the sustainability of natural resources. Forest fires release a significant amount of pollutants into the air, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and other harmful compounds. These pollutants can significantly degrade air quality, leading to health issues for humans and animals. The forest fire in the Bromo region of Indonesia had a profound impact, both economically and environmentally. The closure of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park drastically reduced tourism, leading to an 80 % drop in hotel occupancy and severe losses for local businesses like jeep rentals, eateries, and souvenir shops. Economically, this resulted in a significant decrease in Non-Tax State Revenue. Environmentally, the fire destroyed over 50 hectares of land, severely damaging the national park's ecosystems and affecting biodiversity. The smoke and heat from the fire also led to poor air quality and potential health risks for local residents, as well as adverse effects on nearby agriculture, increasing stress and anxiety in the community.. The study emphasizes the urgent need for stringent regulations, effective community engagement, and educational initiatives in forest conservation areas, particularly those attracting tourists. Our findings offer critical insights for policymakers, local authorities, and stakeholders in the tourism sector, highlighting the necessity of balancing environmental protection with the growth of the global travel industry.

TI  - No tillage and bagasse mulching alter fungal biomass and community structure during decomposition of sugarcane leaf litter in Lampung Province, Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil fungi are the predominant decomposers of soil organic matter (SUM). To manage SOM in tropical agricultural soils, it is important to understand the effects of agricultural management on fungal communities and their decomposition of organic matter. Our study site was located in a sugarcane plantation in Lampung Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. The objectives of this study were to determine the following: (1) the effect of conversion from conventional tillage to no-tillage farming and the application of bagasse mulch on fungal biomass, community structure, and the relative ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass (F:B); (2) the combination effect of no-tillage with bagasse mulch on these fungal parameters; and (3) possible links between these fungal parameters and the decomposition rate of sugarcane leaf litter. We measured fungal biomass and F:B by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and we evaluated fungal molecular diversity and community structure by modified terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling. Fungal biomass was 2-fold greater with no-tillage and 2.5-fold greater with added bagasse mulch relative to conventional (tillage without mulch) plots. On the other hand, no-tillage also increased bacterial biomass and fungal 0Th (operational taxonomic unit) richness, whereas bagasse mulch increased the F:B and inhibited a specific fungal OM. Under a combination of no-tillage and bagasse mulch, the fungal biomass was 1.7-fold greater than in conventional plots, indicating that the combination did not have an additive effect on fungal biomass. The litter mass loss rate was negatively correlated with fungal biomass, and bagasse mulch suppressed the mass loss approximately 20% less than in the conventional plots. However, the mass loss rate in no-tillage plots did not differ from that in conventional plots. Overall, our results indicated that no-tillage and bagasse much increased litter fungal biomass and altered the fungal communities, and these changes were reflected in the litter decomposition and soil C dynamics. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between litter decomposition and fungal species identity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION IN A SECONDARY BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST SUGGESTS SITE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The diameter distribution of a forest makes it possible to understand its ecological processes and to define actions related to forest management aiming at forest conservation, biodiversity increase, production, and carbon sequestration, among others. This study aimed to identify variation in the diameter distribution in a secondary Atlantic Forest, as a function of sites, over 24 years. The diameter at 1.3 m in height (dbh) was measured for each tree over 5.0 cm dbh, in ten sites, from 1992 to 2016. It was analyzed the quadratic mean diameter (Dq), the Dq annual periodic increment (API(Dq)), the Liocourt's Quotient (q), and the diameter distribution with Meyer's exponential model. The average API(Dq )over 24 years was 0.03 cm year(-1), an average increase of 0.21%, with site variation ranging from 0.74% to -0.45%. The diameter distribution of the forest as a whole maintained the reverse J-shaped over 24-years. When the sites in each inventory year were analyzed, the variation in the diameter distribution was evident, and there were differences in the recovery capacity of the reverse J-shaped distribution from 1992 to 2016. The overall results indicate that, whenever possible, the management plan to recover the structure of the Atlantic Forest remnants should be site-specific, particularly in the mountainous region where the environmental conditions are quite diverse.

TI  - Near Real-Time Fire Detection and Monitoring in the MATOPIBA Region, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MATOPIBA is an agricultural frontier, where fires are essential for its biodiversity maintenance. However, the increase in its recurrence and intensity, as well as accidental fires can lead to socioeconomic and environmental losses. Due to this dual relationship with fire, near real-time (NRT) fire management is required throughout the region. In this context, we developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first Machine Learning (ML) algorithm based on the GOES-16 ABI sensor able to detect and monitor Active Fires (AF) in NRT in MATOPIBA. To do so, we analyzed the best combination of three ML algorithms and how long it takes to consider a historical time series able to support accurate AF predictions. We used the most accurate combination for the final model (FM) development. The results show that the FM ensures an overall accuracy rate of approximately 80%. The FM potential is remarkable not only for single detections but also for a consecutive sequence of positive predictions. Roughly, the FM achieves an accuracy rate peak after around 20 h of consecutive AF detections, but there is an important trade-off between the accuracy and the time required to assemble more fire indications, which can be decisive for firefighters in real life.

TI  - Tree-crop interactions and their environmental and economic implications in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, both under and outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value. If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha(-1) in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from clonal eucalyptus forests in different spacing arrangements
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Eucalyptus is the most commonly cultivated genus in Brazil, more information is needed on how these forests can act as a sink for greenhouse gases. This study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of eucalyptus forests by quantifying both the seasonal rates of exchange of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases at the soil-atmosphere interface and their relationships with soil variables (moisture, temperature and physicochemical attributes). Soil organic carbon sequestration rate was used together with soil GHG emission to estimate net global warming potential. This study was conducted at an experimental forestry station in the south-central region of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. No differences were found between treatments in the seasonal fluxes of N2O and CH4, which may have resulted from similar soil properties, particularly bulk density and nitrate (NO3-) contents. CH4 flux dynamics were mainly controlled by the concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) in the soil. In all treatments, the soil acted as a continuous sink for CH4, absorbing it at an average rate of -65 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), which was higher than the results of other studies conducted in native areas of the Cerrado biome and planted forests. However, although CH4 removal helped offset greenhouse gas emissions, net emissions were seen in most treatments due to N2O emissions in greater magnitude and soil carbon losses.

TI  - What is the impact of pasture reform on organic carbon compartments and CO2 emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado?
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The emission of CO2 from the soil in agricultural areas is the result of the interaction of several factors, including soil and crop management practices and local edaphoclimatic conditions. The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas, can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability, quality, or decomposition capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating CO2 emissions. The study was carried out in the municipality of Selviria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing, subsidized by the forage plant Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas, and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The results indicated that soil management practices, followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with U. brizantha, increased the total OC (TOC) stocks through the stable fraction (OC associated with the mineral fraction) and consequent reduction in CO2 emissions from the soil. This highlights the spatial variability in CO2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere. The use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast CO2 emissions from the soil. This small-scale study provides a theoretical basis for the large-scale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control CO2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems, particularly in degraded pasture areas.

TI  - Evaluating the feasibility of oil palm agroforestry in Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - About 2.5 million hectares of a total of 15 million hectares of oil palm plantation in Indonesia are planted in, or conflict with, the forest zone. Oil palm plantations face a conflict between socio-economic and ecological issues. This study was conducted in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi to evaluate the potential of oil palm-based agroforestry to reconcile economic and ecological interests, by considering socio-economic and financial feasibility as well as biodiversity and land cover. The financial feasibility of oil palm agroforestry is compared to oil palm monoculture, employing a discounted cash flow approach using three indicators: net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR). Two ecological indicators-biodiversity and land cover-are evaluated in an experimental plot of oil palm agroforestry in Jambi. This study indicates that the NPV, BCR, and IRR of oil palm monoculture are IDR 62,644,836 (US$ 4,476.84), 1.39, and 20.77%, respectively, while the oil palm agroforestry planted in the experimental plot potentially generates much better values of financial indicators with NPV, BCR, and IRR being IDR 209,221,212 (US$ 14,951.76), 1.79, and 24.42%, respectively. Besides evaluating financial feasibility, we also found that the reviewed current studies indicate that the oil palm agroforestry provides positive ecological impacts, such as increased forest land cover, invertebrate fauna, and bird diversity.

TI  - Synergies among climate change and biodiversity conservation measures and policies in the forest sector: A case study of Southeast Asian countries
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation contributes to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation. To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia.This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.

AB  - Incorporation of native areas to production systems induced changes in ecosystems, especially in tropical regions, due to inappropriate land use, resulting in the rapid loss of organic carbon. This study aimed to evaluate impact of soil management and land use on biomass and microbial activity, as well as soil organic carbon and its fractions in an Oxisol and Quartzipsamment in Cerrado. Management and land use systems in Quartzipsamment were native vegetation, crop-livestock integration, pasture, no-till 1 (soybean/Brachiaria) and two no-till 2 (corn/Brachiaria). In Oxisol the systems were native vegetation, crop-livestock integration, conventional tillage, no-till 3 (soybean/radish/corn radish) and no-till 4 (soybean/corn/sorghum/soybean). Both soils evaluated, integrated crop-livestock improved the microbial biomass levels and soil carbon pools. In Quartzipsamment, management and land use systems not increased microbial biomass carbon, urease activity, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate and the carbon stock of the light fraction. In Oxisol, conventional tillage system decreased soil organic carbon and total carbon in the free light fraction soil. Furthermore, although it increased the organic carbon soil losses, the soil conservation systems enhanced the light fraction carbon in relation to native vegetation.

TI  - An evaluation of contemporary savanna fire regimes in the Canastra National Park, Brazil: Outcomes of fire suppression policies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts. In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity. Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP), southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector, non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Species richness accelerates marine ecosystem restoration in the Coral Triangle
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration aims to restore biodiversity and valuable functions that have been degraded or lost. The Coral Triangle is a hotspot for marine biodiversity held in its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, all of which are in global decline. These coastal ecosystems support valuable fisheries and endangered species, protect shorelines, and are significant carbon stores, functions that have been degraded by coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems affect human well-being in many important ways, and restoration will become ever more important as conservation efforts cannot keep up with their loss.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian government intends to complete the paving of the BR-319 highway, which connects Porto Velho in the deforestation arc region with Manaus in the middle of the Amazon Forest. This paving is being planned despite environmental legislation, and there is concern that its effectiveness will cause additional deforestation, threatening large portions of forest, conservation units (CUs), and indigenous lands (ILs) in the surrounding areas. In this study, we evaluated environmental degradation along the BR-319 highway from 2008 to 2020 and verified whether highway maintenance has contributed to deforestation. For this purpose, we created a 20 km buffer adjacent to the BR-319 highway and evaluated variables extracted from remote sensing information between 2008 and 2020. Fire foci, burned areas, and rainfall data were used to calculate a drought index using statistical tests for a time series. Furthermore, these were related to data on deforestation, CUs, and ILs using principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation. Our results showed that 743 km(2) of forest was deforested during the period evaluated, most of which occurred in the last four years. A total of 16,472 fire foci were identified. Both deforestation and fire foci occurred mainly outside the CUs and ILs. The most affected areas were close to capital cities, and after resuming road maintenance in 2015, deforestation increased outside the capital cities. Current government policy for Amazon occupation promotes deforestation and will compromise Brazil's climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and deforestation.

TI  - Cave-dwelling bats of Carajás National Forest: New cytogenetic data of threatened species
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, bat species that use caves as shelters are constantly susceptible to anthropic impacts. Of the 181 species of bats in Brazil, 81 are recorded in caves, 13 of which are considered essentially cave dwellers. The Caraj & aacute;s National Forest Conservation Unit, located in the southeastern region of Par & aacute;, serves as a refuge for these species, among others. The present work sought to reveal the chromosomal diversity of bats in six caves of the Caraj & aacute;s National Forest. Cytogenetic analyses were carried out for some species as an additional tool for taxonomic identification. We present here the conventional karyotype of eight species, five being described for the first time in Brazilian specimens. We also described for the first time the karyotypes of Natalus macrourus and Peropteryx kappleri. These findings may be helpful to support conservation guidelines, and for the knowledge of these species' biodiversity, evolutionary history, and to support genome sequencing efforts.

TI  - Vascular Epiphyte Diversity in a Key Atlantic Forest Remnant from Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vascular epiphytes contribute significantly to the biodiversity of tropical forests. We aimed to identify the epiphyte species occurring in the Muriqui Trail at Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (SBSP), a priority area for Atlantic forest conservation in southeastern Brazil. We selected 10 phorophytes, from which we sampled epiphytes and took light intensity measurements at three strata: up to 4 m, 4 to 8 m, and above 8 m. Phorophytes represented eight species, eight genera, and six families. We found 25 epiphytic species from 17 genera and nine families. Ferns showed highest richness, especially Polypodiaceae. We report herein important data on epiphyte diversity in eastern Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata), including the occurrence of species rarely cited in surveys. Fomenting local conservation along with environmental education may be pivotal for counteracting anthropic pressure on SBSP.

TI  - Chemical characteristics of soil organic matter from integrated agricultural systems in southeastern Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an essential role in agronomic systems and is of great importance to environmental sustainability and carbon sequestration. This study evaluates the accumulation of carbon in soils from integrated agricultural systems (S) that include crop (C), livestock (L), and forest (F) components (in different combinations: CLFS, LFS and CLS) and an undisturbed native forest (NF) as a reference area. The study sites are part of the Embrapa Pecuaria Sudeste research station located in the southeast of Brazil in a region of dystrophic Red-Yellow Latosol soils. Stable carbon isotopic analysis (delta C-13) and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate the chemical characteristics of humic acid (HA) extracts of soils from different soil horizons. The findings were discussed in the context of laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) measurements on the whole soils and carbon content on both the whole soils and HA extracts. With increasing depth of the soil horizons, bulk SOM (in the whole soil) and a more recalcitrant humic fraction (the HA) became enriched in carbon, indicative of accumulation. Isotopic analysis revealed that SOM in the crop-livestock-forest system exhibited delta C-13 signatures corresponding to C4 plants (grass and corn). The native forest exhibited a uniform delta C-13 signature characteristic of C3 plants (native trees). Benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCA) quantification on limited samples revealed condensed aromatic structures in both crop-livestock-forest system and native forest. The absence of burning suggests that these compounds come from the humification of lignin. Based on structural characterization, carbon is sequestered as recalcitrant and long-lived oxidized ligninaceous structures and condensed aromatic groups. The current research demonstrates the feasibility of novel agricultural approaches such as using crop-livestock-forest systems. Such pastureland management enhances higher agricultural productivity and sustainability, thus avoiding new deforestation of native areas. Highlights Integrated agricultural systems enhance carbon enrichment in soil organic matter and humic acids. Carbon stabilized in oxidized ligninaceous and condensed molecules promotes long-term carbon storage. Extended root systems are likely to play a critical role in carbon sequestration. Integrated agricultural systems can be effective alternatives for reducing greenhouse gases.HighlightsIntegrated agricultural systems enhance carbon enrichment in soil organic matter and humic acids.Carbon stabilized in oxidized ligninaceous and condensed molecules promotes long-term carbon storage.Extended root systems are likely to play a critical role in carbon sequestration.Integrated agricultural systems can be effective alternatives for reducing greenhouse gases.

TI  - Evidence of limited carbon sequestration in soils under no-tillage systems in the Cerrado of Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian government aims at augmenting the area cropped under no-tillage (NT) from 32 to 40 million ha by 2020 as a means to mitigate CO2 emissions. We estimated soil carbon (C) sequestration under continuous NT systems in two municipalities in the Goias state that are representative of the Cerrado. A chronosequence of NT fields of different age since conversion from conventional tillage (CT) was sampled in 2003 and 2011. Soil C levels of native Cerrado and pasture were measured for comparison. After about 11 to 14 years, soil C stocks under NT were highest and at the levels of those under natural Cerrado. Average annual rates of soil C sequestration estimated using the chronosequence approach were respectively 1.61 and 1.48 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the 2003 and 2011 sampling, and were higher than those observed using repeated sampling after eight years. The diachronic sampling revealed that the younger NT fields tended to show higher increases in soil C stocks than the older fields. Converting an extra 8 million ha of cropland from CT to NT represents an estimated soil C storage of about 8 Tg C yr(-1) during 10 to 15 years.

TI  - Soil organic carbon in an integrated crop-livestock system under different grazing intensities
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) under no-till may be an effective tool to promote soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. However, it is not yet clear how pasture management affects SOC accumulation. In this study, we assessed the effect of grazing intensity (10, 20, 30, and 40 cm of sward height and no grazing) on SOC and coefficients of soil organic matter dynamics and used them in a simulation of SOC sequestration in a 0-20 cm soil layer. The overall study was conducted on a subtropical rhodic hapludox from southern Brazil managed as a no-till integrated soybean-beef cattle system for 13 yr. SOC sequestration rates ranged from 0.097 Mg ha(-1 )yr(-1) with a pasture sward height of 10 cm to 0.308 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with one of 40 cm. Simulations revealed a higher potential of the soil for C sequestration with a moderate (30 cm) or low (40 cm) grazing intensity. Although the ICLS under no-till led to a positive carbon balance irrespective of grazing intensity, the simulation of temporal evolution of SOC stocks over time revealed a higher potential for SOC accumulation with the less intensive grazing treatments than with the more intensive ones.

TI  - Modelling SOC response to land use change and management practices in sugarcane cultivation in South-Central Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the impact of land use change (LUC) from native vegetation and pasture to sugarcane cultivation as well as to evaluate the effect of different management practices on long-term SOC dynamics using the CENTURY ecosystem model.A soil data set of 85 study areas including sugarcane, pasture and annual crops from eleven counties distributed over the south-central region of Brazil was used for model validation and three future scenarios of sugarcane management were simulated: i) green harvesting (SC1); ii) green harvesting plus organic amendments (SC2) and iii) green harvesting plus low N inputs (SC3). Sugarcane harvest with burning was simulated as the baseline system (SCB).The model performance was good (R-2 = 0.79) in replicating measured C stocks as well as reflecting the main trends of C stock changes due to LUC. Long-term simulations suggested that changes in the sugarcane harvest from burning to green harvesting would increase soil C stocks by an average of 0.21 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The potential of C accumulation was projected to be higher when vinasse and filter cake are added to the soil, varying between 0.34 and 0.37 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in SC3 and SC2 respectively.The Century model can be used as tool to study the impact of different soil managements in the SOC dynamics in sugarcane. C losses due to the conversion from pasture to sugarcane can be totally restored after 24, 17 and 18 years under SC1, SC2 and SC3, respectively.

TI  - Carbon Stocks and Isotopic Composition of the Organic Matter in Soils Covered by Native Vegetation and Pasture in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change constitutes one of main way of alteration of soil organic matter in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The goal of this study was to compare the carbon stock and the isotopic signature of the organic matter in the soil of areas with different land use,covered with forest and grass (pasture). The study area is located at Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Using un-deformed soil samples, we measured the carbon content and bulk density. The isotopic signature of soil carbon was determined through the analysis of isotopic ratio C-12/C-13. The pasture soil stocks 48% less carbon than the soil covered by natural forest. The isotopic signature indicated that 42.2% of organic matter of the soil covered by pasture is originated from grasses. This characterizes a highly degradation of organic matter in the environment, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Hence, some guidelines of recuperation are described in order to restore the soil organic matter, structure and porosity.

TI  - Cover Crops Can Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from No-Till Maize in Southern Brazil: Insights from a Long-Term Field Experiment
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the countries that has the most agricultural area under no-till (NT) management. This research study aims to evaluate life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maize (M) grain production in agroecosystems that used different cover crops under NT management in southern Brazil. The data for this study were from a long-term 41-year field experiment in southern Brazil. The long-term experiment evaluated the effects of fallow (F) and cover crops (oat (O), vetch (V), cowpea (B), pigeon pea (P), and lablab (L)) on nitrous oxide and methane emissions and soil carbon (C) sequestration in maize agroecosystems. Five cropping systems, FM, OV/M, OV/MB, PM, and LM, were evaluated. Our results show that cover crops can reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by similar to 40 to >100% through increased soil C sequestration. The agroecosystems with winter cover crops (OV/M and OV/MB) had higher life-cycle GHG emissions (0.5 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of M or 2.6 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)) than the agroecosystem with winter F (0.06 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of M or 0.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)). Summer cover crops (P and L) resulted in negative life-cycle GHG emissions (an average of -0.2 kg CO(2)e kg M-1 or -1.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)) and increased the M grain yield. This study shows that cover crops can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from NT M in southern Brazil.

TI  - Simulation of management and soil interactions impacting SOC dynamics in sugarcane using the CENTURY Model
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Newer methods of management and harvesting of sugarcane are being considered to improve soil and water conservation in Brazil. Our aim in this study was to evaluate soil C dynamics under sugarcane cultivation as influenced by the use of conservation management, using measurements from four different management systems and land use histories, i.e. conventional management with preharvest burning, no burning with residue retention and two systems without burning plus additional organic amendments. Field sites also differed in terms of soil texture. We compared field measurements of soil C stocks, C-13 and microbial biomass with simulated results from the Century ecosystem model for each of the sites and management histories. We also did long-term simulations of the management treatments and sites to approximate steady-state SOC levels, to explore potential management-induced differences in SOC stocks and interactions with soil texture. The model accurately represented treatment and site differences for total SOC stocks, in which SOC stocks were strongly affected by both rates of organic matter input to soil and soil clay content. However, the model tended to underestimate the relative contribution of sugarcane-derived C to total SOC for sites with high residue and external organic matter amendments. Measured microbial biomass C across the sites was closely aligned with relative amounts of organic matter input but did not appear to be strongly affected by soil texture, whereas the model predicted that both texture and organic matter input rate would impact microbial biomass C. Long-term simulations of the conservation management alternatives suggested that SOC stocks could be maintained at or above levels in the original native CerradAo vegetation, whereas conventional practices using residue burning would result in a reduction of SOC to ca. 60% of native levels. Our results support the use of the CENTURY model as an aid to assess the impacts of different soil management practices on SOC stocks under sugarcane in Brazil.

TI  - Forest biomass recovery twenty-four years after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Eastern Amazon
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Para<acute accent>, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH >= 10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH >= 10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change.

AB  - Direct seeding is a promising technique for reforestation, but it has been poorly studied in tropical forests. The research aims to assess the briquette composition, size and site preparation, and sowing date on the seedling survival and early growth of Gmelina arborea direct seeding at 12 months in Parung Panjang, Bogor. The briquette was printed using some materials, i.e., soil, compost, charcoal, lime and tapioca as a glue, and tested in a greenhouse to obtain the optimal seed germination. The complete randomized design was used to assess the optimum seed briquette composition on germination parameters in the greenhouse, while a randomized block design was used to assess the eight combinations of briquette sizes and site preparation techniques on the seedling survival and growth. The briquette composition of soil 10%, compost 45%, rice husk charcoal 35%, lime 5%, and tapioca 5% resulted in the best germination capacity (78.5%) and other germination parameters. Gmelina arborea seed briquette, which had the size of diameter 5 cm and thickness 3 cm sowed by land clearing and briquette burial, showed the highest seedling survival (56.8%) and growth (seedling height 120.32 cm and diameter 15.92 mm) compared to other sizes. The sowing date also significantly influenced the survival of direct seeding. The application on the early-middle rainy season (the middle of December) was optimal for direct seeding because of the stable rainy frequency in Parung Panjang, Bogor. This study supports the use of direct seeding of the species being studied, but the methods could be improved to include a more significant number of species.

TI  - Territorial expansion of eucalyptus monoculture in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - NOVOS CADERNOS NAEA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the expansion of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) species in the eastern Amazon, specifically in the municipalities of Paragominas, Dom Eliseu, Rondon do Para and Ulianopolis in the State of Para, applying the Monoculture Index (MI) as a territorial management indicator. The IM was adapted for the amazon region and the limits were established based on the area available for use in rural properties located in the Amazon region. The monoculture indexes for 2018 and 2021 varied greatly among the municipalities and the highest indexes were found for the municipalities of Dom Elizeu and Ulianopolis, Such municipalities were considered to have an area restriction index for eucalyptus expansion. It is considered that this index can be used in the planning of forestry projects, helping in the management of the territory and in the definition of policies that guide enterprises and municipalities in the use of forest species in reforestation projects in the Amazon region.

TI  - Earthworm populations sampled using collection methods in atlantic forests with Araucaria angustifolia
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia, also known as the Parana Pine is an endangered tree species in Brazil and little is known of the diversity of soil invertebrates inhabiting these forests. Therefore, the present study was set up to evaluate the biomass and diversity of earthworms in natural and reforested Araucaria plots, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient earthworm collection method. Four study areas included: native forest with Araucaria (NF); Araucaria reforestation (R); Araucaria reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native Araucaria and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Five soil samples containing the earthworm community were taken in a 0.3 ha area in each of the forest sites, close to five Araucaria trees selected at random. Three collection methods were tested: application of dilute Formol (0.5%) to the soil surface, handsorting of small (25 x 25 cm) or large (40 x 40 cm) monoliths. Five earthworm species were found: the native Glossoscolex sp. 1, Glossoscolex sp. 2, Glossoscolex bondari and Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae), and the exotic Amynthas corticis (Megascolecidae). Formol was more efficient for collecting A. corticis, found in much higher abundance and biomass in NF than in the other areas. Larger handsorted samples were more efficient for capturing Glossoscolex species, mainly present in RF and NPF. For adequate characterization of earthworm abundance and biomass in these Araucaria forests, both the Formol and the larger monolith methods are recommended.

TI  - Stratification ratio of organic matter pools influenced by management systems in a weathered Oxisol from a tropical agro-ecoregion in Brazil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancement of organic matter plays an essential role in improving soil quality for supporting sustainable food production. Changes in carbon stocks with impacts on emissions of greenhouse gases may result from the stratification of organic matter as a result of soil use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of soil management systems on soil carbon stocks and stratification ratios (SR) of soil organic matter pools. Total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen, basal respiration, and particulate organic matter nitrogen (PON) were determined. The field experiment comprised several tillage treatments: conventional tillage, no-till with biannual rotation, no-till with biannual rotation combined with a second crop, no-till with annual rotation, and pasture. The labile fractions indicated a high level of variation among management systems. Pasture proved to be an excellent option for the improvement of soil carbon. While the conventional tillage system reduced total carbon stocks of the soil (0-40 cm), no-tillage presented TOC stocks similar to that of native vegetation. Sensitivity of the TOC SR varied from 0.93 to 1.28, a range of 0.35; the range for POC was 1.76 and for MBC 1.64. The results support the hypothesis that the labile fractions (POC, MBC, and PON) are highly sensitive to the dynamics of organic matter in highly weathered soils of tropical regions influenced by different management systems. Reductions to SRs of labile organic matter pools are related to the impacts of agricultural use of Cerrado soils.

AB  - Deforestation and degraded forest land will continue to affect climate patterns in various places and trigger an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather events and extreme climate. The impacts felt by the community are quite a lot both in the social, economic, infrastructure, fishery, agriculture, health, tourism sectors, even in the areas of defence and security. Various anticipatory steps need to do by raising awareness of the community and relevant stakeholders to this issue of climate change. One of the actions of climate change adaptation in the capacity building is to encourage the emergence of national and local policies that address the concerns and readiness mitigation to cope with the impacts of climate change on various fronts, particularly in agriculture and food security. This study aims to encourage the preparation of the policy masterplan of agroforestry development as an effort to mitigate climate change in Madiun, East Java, Indonesia. With a Diagnostic and Design approach (D&D), a policy recommendation for agroforestry development in the medium and long-term developed. The result of a D&D approach by the available resource potential, the agroforestry model that is feasible to be developed is agro-silviculture and agro-silvopastoral.

AB  - In developing countries, including Indonesia, ecotourism can potentially be a strategy to conserve forests as well as generating local income and thus alleviating poverty. This concept is applicable to accommodate tourism development in this country, preventing negative impacts of mass tourism. Due to its potential resources, the government had long been established sets of regulations to accommodate the implementation of ecotourism in forest areas. However, it is important to measure whether these regulations are consistent with ecotourism principles to ensure sustainability aspects. This study aims to evaluate several regulations in Indonesia related to ecotourism implementation in terms of their consistency in applying ecotourism principles. The research method was a desk study and content analysis. Results showed that the Ministry of Environment and Forestry had enacted regulations to encourage the implementation of the ecotourism concept in managing tourist destinations located in forest areas: production, protected and conservation forests. However, several ecotourism principles were not regulated, such as environmental and local education culture to visitors and local people, conservation planning in the tourist destination, and control mechanisms. In conclusion, it is essential to elaborate ecotourism principles in the regulations to ensure the sustainability aspects of ecotourism implementation in state forest areas.

TI  - Agricultural development with rainforest conservation: Methods for seeking best bet alternatives to slash-and-burn, with applications to Brazil and Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests continue to fall for agricultural purposes throughout the humid tropics, with immediate and potentially large consequences for climate change and biodiversity loss-issues of key interest to the international community. Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty-issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the 'international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear 'best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.

AB  - Estimates of species extinction due to human impact on tropical forests have previously been based on the relationship between species number and area. Here we use a different approach to estimate loss of tree species in the Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil. We evaluate the characteristics of plant species, their avian dispersers and the distribution of the forest remnants on the landscape to estimate that about 33.9% of tree species in this region will become extinct on a regional scale. Because northeast Brazil is the most threatened sector of South American Atlantic forest, our results highlight the need to change the current conservation paradigm for this region. Rather than focus on the creation of isolated reserves in any medium-to-large forest remnant, a bioregional planning approach is urgently required to rescue this unique biota from extinction.

TI  - Utility of landscape mosaics and boundaries in forest conservation decision making in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated changes in the Atlantic Forest landscape over the last 40 years based on changes in boundaries and mosaics, including the hypothetical landscape resulting from the application of Brazilian laws for forest protection. Mosaics were identified as sets of land-use patches with a similar pattern of boundaries. Landscapes of different years, therefore, can be distinguished by differences in mosaics. We developed a technique to identify boundaries between patches from land-use maps using ArcGis(A (R)) and to build the patch x boundary matrix required for mosaic identification by means of a factorial and cluster analysis. The mosaics were characterized by some key uses as well as by their boundaries with other land uses. The mosaics were scored for forest conservation according to five issues: landscape permeability, cover, availability, quality, and fragmentation of forest. The values were based on land use and boundary patterns. Although Brazilian laws regarding forest protection have promoted conservation and the hypothetical legal landscape has presented the highest forest habitat availability, this expansion perpetuates a boundary pattern that complicates conservation and management, thus increasing the pressure on forest patches and favoring the further fragmentation of protected forest patches. These conclusions cannot be reached by simply recording changes in land uses.

TI  - Collembola community structure under different land management in subtropical Brazil
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tillage systems in conservation agriculture such as no-tillage (NT) and crop-livestock integration (CLI) have been proposed to limit the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Soil organisms such as Collembola are good indicators because they respond to a variety of environmental and ecological factors and their community structure indicates a change in land management. In this study, we propose to assess the relationships between springtail biodiversity in management systems with a history of NT and CLI. For both management systems, nine points were sampled, distributed in a 30x30m sampling grid, in three municipalities on the Southern Santa Catarina Plateau, Brazil. Springtails were collected using a metal cylinder (5 cm diameterx5 cm deep) and identified at the species level. At the same point, samples were collected to evaluate soil properties (chemical, physical and microbiological). In total, 538 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 species, 293 individuals (18 species) in NT and 245 individuals (17 species) in the CLI system. Soil management systems studied did not affect the total number of individuals and richness. The NT system had a greater association with epigeic species, while the CLI system was more associated with hemiedaphic and edaphic species, which is related to the site-specific differences in soil conditions. In both soil management systems, the species were influenced by a range of soil properties. The species Isotomurus sp. 1 and Lepidocyrtus sp. 1 were more influenced by soil properties in the NT system, while the species Proisotoma sp. 1, Sminthurinus sp. 1 and Tullbergia antarctica were more influenced by soil properties in the CLI system, compared to the others. Collembola community structure and species diversity were modified by the soil management systems. Our results suggest that the Collembola community may indicate changes across land management systems in conservation agriculture.

TI  - Bamboo overabundance alters forest structure and dynamics in the Atlantic Forest hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With fast growth rates and clonal reproduction, bamboos can rapidly invade forest areas, drastically changing their original structure. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where recent mapping efforts have shown that woody bamboos dominate large areas, the present study assessed the differences in soil and vegetation between plots dominated (>90% of bamboo coverage) and not dominated (<10% of coverage) by the native Guadua tagoara. Surface soil was physically and chemically analyzed, and trees at three size classes (seedling, sapling, and adult) were counted, identified and measured. New inventories were conducted to assess recruitment, mortality, and damage rates. Bamboo plots had more fertile soils (higher bases saturation and lower potential acidity) due to the preferential occurrence of G. tagoara on more clayey soils. Bamboo-dominated plots had lower density of adult trees (diameter >5 cm) and lower species density. In addition, overall tree diameter distribution was very different between environments, with bamboo plots having greater concentration of small-sized trees. Such differences are probably related to the general tendency of higher mortality, recruitment, and damage rates in bamboo plots. Greater physical (wind and bamboo-induced damages) and physiological stress (heat and light) in bamboo plots are probable causes of bamboo-dominated plots being more dynamic. Finally, we discuss the differences between Atlantic and Amazonian Guadua-dominated forests, causes, and possible consequences of bamboo overabundance to the Atlantic Forest conservation.

Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of this component of biodiversity is still unknown for most groups, which limits its application for selecting priority areas to conserve. In the present study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Minaria (Apocynaceae) based on plastid (trnH-psbA, rps16, trnS-trnG and trnD-trnT) and nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA markers and 34 morphological characters, and analysed the geographic distribution of the phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE) in this genus. Minaria includes 21 species that are highly concentrated in the Espinhaco Range, in eastern Brazil, most of which (similar to 75%) are narrowly distributed. The spatial analyses of PD and PE of Minaria indicate four evolutionary relevant areas in this region. The Serra do Cipo and the Diamantina Plateau contain 10 endemic species and present the highest levels of PD. However, the two other areas also deserve special attention. Rio de Contas has high levels of PE, because of two endemic sister species that represent a phylogenetically isolated lineage and the Southern Espinhaco Range houses the most critically endangered species of the genus. Most endemic species of Minaria occur in vegetation islands on rocky outcrops (campos rupestres). These low-fuel areas are less susceptible to fire, suggesting that the Espinhaco Range has served as a historical refuge for fire-sensitive lineages. Our results suggest that conservation units in the Espinhaco Range cover a great proportion of the evolutionary diversity of Minaria and that fire management is probably an important strategy to preserve this endemic biodiversity.

TI  - Fire in Savannas and its Impact on Avifauna: Considerations for a Better Environmental Conservation.
T2  - Sociedade & Natureza
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas are a pyrophytic biome, a biodiversity hotspot, and have global importance, occupying 20% of the Earth's surface. It is a biome that requires burning to maintain its biodiversity and pyrodiversity. It has suffered from altered fire regimes due to the direct and indirect action of factors such as deforestation, agriculture, cattle ranching, and climate change, resulting in habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. This fact can impact the avifauna, changing population dynamics and distribution in the landscape. Thus, through a literature search, this study evaluated the influences of fire on avifauna populations in savannas. It was found that fire impacts avifauna directly or indirectly and acts positively or negatively, according to the niche of the species evaluated and its intrinsic characteristics. The observed effect will depend on the fire detection ability, locomotion capacity, species, habit, functional guild, demographic parameters, resource availability, post-disturbance successional evolution, dispersal ability, and the geographic scale of the area affected by the fire. The main impacts observed for this clade are indirect effects, and its most negatively impacted populations are the ratites and those with poor locomotion ability. Despite the many gaps in knowledge about the impact of fire on the population parameters of avifauna, studies that focus on community dynamics indicate that, in general, there are few changes in richness and abundance indices. Thus, a greater understanding of the consequences of fire on birds is necessary to support better the actions of the Integrated Fire Management Program and its expansion throughout the Brazilian territory in search of quality, dynamic, and integrated environmental management.

TI  - Characterization of soil fauna under the influence of mercury atmospheric deposition in Atlantic Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing levels of mercury (Hg) found in the atmosphere arising from anthropogenic sources, have been the object of great concern in the past two decades in industrialized countries. Brazil is the seventh country with the highest rate of mercury in the atmosphere. The major input of Hg to ecosystems is through atmospheric deposition (wet and dry), being transported in the atmosphere over large distances. The forest biomes are of strong importance in the atmosphere/soil cycling of elemental Hg through foliar uptake and subsequent transference to the soil through litter, playing an important role as sink of this element. Soil microarthropods are keys to understanding the soil ecosystem, and for such purpose were characterized by the soil fauna of two Units of Forest Conservation of the state of the Rio de Janeiro, in which one of the areas suffer quite interference from petrochemicals and industrial anthropogenic activities and other area almost exempts of these perturbations. The results showed that soil and litter of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil tend to stock high mercury concentrations, which could affect the abundance and richness of soil fauna, endangering its biodiversity and thereby the functioning of ecosystems.

TI  - Well-managed grass is a key strategy for carbon storage and stabilization in anthropized Amazon soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils under anthropic use in the Amazon region are often associated with soil carbon (C) stock losses. More recently, the restoration of degraded pastures and the introduction of integrated systems have changed this pattern, and soil C accumulation is often observed. This study evaluated an 11-year field experiment to quantify soil C changes and elucidate C stabilization mechanisms in areas under anthropic uses in the southern Amazon of Brazil. Four land use systems were evaluated: crop succession (CS), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), integrated crop-livestock-forest (ICLF), and a well-managed pasture (MP). Land uses with a greater presence of wellmanaged grass increased soil C stocks, especially in the top 10 cm, with values of 30.9, 29.7, 36.5, and 39.4 Mg ha-1 in the CS, ICLF, ICL, and MP systems, respectively. Compared to the baseline, ICL and MP systems showed soil C accumulation rates of 0.68-0.95 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Greater aggregate stability and higher mineralassociated organic carbon (MAOC) were observed in both MP and ICL. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verified 11%, 38%, and 32% more recalcitrant C groups (aliphatic/aromatic) in the MP system than ICL, ICLF, and CS at 0-5 cm. In the ICLF system, the eucalyptus row showed 15% lower soil C stocks, less MAOC, and less abundance of recalcitrant groups than the inter-row position. Land use systems with long-term spatial-temporal use of grass in well-managed pastures or ICL promoted greater C stabilization through intra-aggregate occlusion, mineral sorption, and chemical recalcitrance, representing a good strategy to enhance C storage in Amazon anthropized soils.

TI  - Measurement of the Ecological Integrity of Cerrado Streams Using Biological Metrics and the Index of Habitat Integrity
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Generally, aquatic communities reflect the effects of anthropogenic changes such as deforestation or organic pollution. The Cerrado stands among the most threatened ecosystems by human activities in Brazil. In order to evaluate the ecological integrity of the streams in a preserved watershed in the Northern Cerrado biome corresponding to a mosaic of ecosystems in transition to the Amazonia biome in Brazil, biological metrics related to diversity, structure, and sensitivity of aquatic macroinvertebrates were calculated. Sampling included collections along stretches of 200 m of nine streams and measurements of abiotic variables (temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and discharge) and the Index of Habitat Integrity (HII). The values of the abiotic variables and the HII indicated that most of the streams have good ecological integrity, due to high oxygen levels and low concentrations of dissolved solids and electric conductivity. Two streams showed altered HII scores mainly related to small dams for recreational and domestic use, use of Cerrado natural pasture for cattle raising, and spot deforestation in bathing areas. However, this finding is not reflected in the biological metrics that were used. Considering all nine streams, only two showed satisfactory ecological quality (measured by Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), total richness, and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness), only one of which had a low HII score. These results indicate that punctual measures of abiotic parameters do not reveal the long-term impacts of anthropic activities in these streams, including related fire management of pasture that annually alters the vegetation matrix and may act as a disturbance for the macroinvertebrate communities. Due to this, biomonitoring of low order streams in Cerrado ecosystems of the Northern Central Brazil by different biotic metrics and also physical attributes of the riparian zone such as HII is recommended for the monitoring and control of anthropic impacts on aquatic communities.

TI  - Street trees reduce the negative effects of urbanization on birds
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of streets on biodiversity is an important aspect of urban ecology, but it has been neglected worldwide. Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life.

TI  - Soil organic matter and nutrient accumulation in areas under intensive management and swine manure application
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Land use change and soil management are frequently associated to land degradation and soil organic matter (SOM) losses in tropical regions. In Brazil, in order to avoid this process, different management strategies have been applied, such as no-tillage and agricultural disposal of swine manure (SM). This study was carried out to evaluate the quantity and quality of SOM, as well as the occurrence of nutrient accumulation in soils of areas under contrasting management systems that have received consecutive applications of SM over the last decades in Brazil.Materials and methods Five land uses were sampled: native vegetation (NV), pasture with SM application (PA + SM), no-tillage with SM application (NT + SM), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage with SM application (CT + SM). Soil organic carbon (SOC), N, labile C, C management index (CMI), P, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Al3+, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, and H + Al were quantified.Results and discussion Except for PA + SM, the agricultural land uses caused decreases in SOC contents comparing to NV. PA + SM showed the highest C stocks, 138.9 +/- 3.4 Mg ha(-1) down to 0.4 m. The application of SM can be associated to the greater C stocks in PA + SM, NT + SM, and CT + SM and to the higher N contents in all land uses under this practice. Land uses which receive higher rates of swine manure application (PA + SM and CT + SM) have shown CMI greater than 100. However, this practice is associated to the accumulation of P, Cu, Na, and Zn in these soils.Conclusions The SM application is associated to improvement on C stocks and SOM quality in area under pasture, no-tillage, and conventional tillage in Parana State, Brazil. However, this practice is the main driver of nutrient accumulation in these areas.

TI  - Characterization of microstructural stability of biochar-amended Planosol under conventional tillage for irrigated lowland rice ecosystem
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil structural degradation through compression from machine and animal traffic affects soil functioning and threatens environmental sustainability. However, the structural stability of the soil against the external stresses can be enhanced through the addition of organic substances. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of biochar addition on the microstructural stability of a Gleyic Luvic Planosol under yearly conventional tillage of rice-fallow-rice lowland ecosystem in southern Brazil. Organic amendment consisted of four levels of rice husk biochar rates namely 0 % (Bio0), 2 % (Bio2), 5 % (Bio5) and 10 % (Bio10) by dry mass, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 100 g biochar/kg soil. As organic matter is known to closely interact with density, we decided further to investigate the impact of varying density, namely 1.15, 1.33, 1.45, 1.60, and 1.75 g/cm3. Biochar-incubated soil samples were subjected to four levels of matric potentials (0, -3, -6, and -10 kPa). The microstructural stability parameters of strain (gamma), shear resistance (tau), storage and loss moduli (G', G"), and coefficient of structural rigidity (Iz) of the amended soil samples were evaluated using the amplitude sweep test in a rheometer. Increasing biochar rate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil organic matter and, consequently, the water retention capacity of the biochar-amended Planosol. The stabilizing effect of biochar addition was reflected in higher microstructural stability of the amended soil compared to the control (no biochar). Increasing density in the biochar-amended Planosol increased the shear resistance, reduced the strain at linear viscoelasticity and yield point, and decreased the stiffness degradation. Increased strength and quantity of the menisci are the driving forces for the improved microstructural stability of the Planosol and at the nucleus of environmentally sustainable application. This is important when considering potential carbon sequestration and storage effects of biochars.

TI  - The role of legal protection in forest conservation in an urban matrix
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing forest protection standards is essential for biodiversity conservation and for ensuring the public water supply. This study evaluated whether compliance with environmental legislation aimed at protecting the Atlantic Forest is sufficient to minimize the negative effects of urban pressure on the conservation of biodiversity in the water source area of the Billings reservoir in the municipality of Diadema. To assess the effectiveness of environmental legislation, we created a current land use and land cover map as well as maps for an expected legal scenario and evaluated both using landscape metrics. Our findings indicate that forest resource availability in the area is critical but can be improved by compliance with legal obligations, which have complementary effects and the potential to promote less fragmented landscapes. On the other hand, they do not prevent the tendency of fragmentation caused by the surrounding urban matrix, which can reduce the positive effect of the legal compliance on forest conservation in cases of consolidated urban areas.

TI  - Valorization of cattle manure by thermoconversion process in a rotary kiln reactor to produce environmentally friendly products
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has the world's second largest cattle herd, which produces 1.9 billion tons of cattle manure per year. This work describes, for the first time, the processing of cattle manure by pyrolysis at 400, 500, and 600 degrees C in a rotary kiln reactor, as an alternative means of treating this waste to produce second generation biofuels. The biomass was mainly composed of hemicellulose (18.24%), cellulose (14.24%), and lignin (6.09%), with high ash content (18.86%). Pyrolysis of the cattle manure at 500 degrees C resulted in the best bio-oil yield (5.8% organic phase; 34.4% aqueous phase). The bio-oil consisted mainly of phenolic compounds such as phenol and 3-vinyl-phenol. The results for the biochar were indicative of its potential use in agricultural applications for correcting soil acidity. The biochars produced at higher temperatures presented a high degree of aromaticity, indicating the formation of a more stable material for the purposes of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional threshold responses of vertebrate communities in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological thresholds are an indicator of rapid and non-linear changes along both natural habitat and land-use gradients. Thus, they can be used to quantify biodiversity responses to human-induced environmental change. We investigated multiple thresholds by analyzing eight environmental predictors of both taxonomic and functional composition of amphibian and bird communities in 47 independent sample units, located within a heterogeneous land use matrix of the megadiverse Atlantic Forest hotspot. We demonstrate that current land use practices alter both the taxonomic and functional composition and promote the establishment of non-native taxa resulting in novel assemblages. Whereas anuran communities experienced dramatic compositional shifts as a result of the transformation of closed forest habitats into Eucalyptus monocultures (at less than 10% land cover), bird communities were mainly altered through the loss of old-growth forest (at 20% forest cover loss). In both groups, observed thresholds were lower than previously reported and much lower than the 20% forest set-aside requirement defined by current land-use legislation. We argue that the strategy of halting forest loss through rapid afforestation with non-native trees has converse and potentially detrimental effects on the conservation of native forest biodiversity. Future studies need to investigate how including novel assemblages in current conservation management strategies can enhance biodiversity protection in human-impacted forest landscapes. The identification of taxon-specific thresholds for both taxonomic and functional community shifts is indispensable when formulating common land use practices and designing mitigation measures. Threshold analyses can guide these actions by providing clear and quantifiable break-points for conservation practitioners.

T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soils requires appropriate cropping systems and conservation practices that increase crop biomass production. No tillage agriculture provides several advantages to establish "carbon friendly" production systems. Conservation agriculture has greatly expanded over the past three decades in the North Central region of Rio Grande de Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, with about 6 million ha of land under dryland grain crop agriculture. A shift from intensive conventional tillage to mulch tillage and then no tillage has resulted in increased SOC levels across much of the region as verified in field measurements. In this study a modeling system was constructed by coupling the interactive Century (i_Century) software running Century 4.0 and ArcGIS data layers to simulate the long-term SOC trends in the Ibiruba region, which occupies a land area of 83,500 ha. This system was capable of accounting for cropping system and management practices trends from 1900 to the present times, as well as simulating projections out to the year 2050, capturing periods of decreasing or increasing SOC trends. Simulations performed with the modeling system show that SOC stocks in lbiruba, estimated at 5.05 Tg C before human activity, decreased to 3.71 Tg C (31%) by 1985. An estimated recovery to 3.97 Tg C by 2005 in response to adoption of SOC-enhancing practices such as conservation tillage and no tillage was observed. Simulations to 2050 with maintenance of these cropping systems and soil management showed that total C stocks could reach 4.21 Tg C, which would still be 21% less than originally present in those soils. The integration of Century with GIS was greatly expedited with the use of the i_Century interface and its readily-accessible database format. Data transfer between the modeling and geoprocessing environment was facilitated for quick visualization and further processing. This approach can be applied for carbon monitoring and accounting schemes at several scales, from the field to the national level. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Logging residues for charcoal production through forest management in the Brazilian Amazon: economic gains and forest regrowth effects
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) practices can potentially reverse loss of forest cover due to deforestation, while concomitantly preserving and maintaining biodiversity, and stimulating jobs, income, and forest services. Recent studies found that significant logging residues (LR) (i.e. leaves, branches, and buttress roots) suitable for bioenergy production were often left in the felling area, triggering risks of forest fires and increased CO2 emissions due to wildfires or decomposition processes. For impact assessment of forest management practices, we collected primary harvesting data and estimated net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for 13 forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a process-based forestry growth model (BGC-Man) to analyze the impacts on forest dynamics of selective logging and removal of LR, subject to landscape, soil texture, and daily weather. We explored the following selective logging scenarios: the Legal Reserve (i.e. reference) scenario, a scenario with one cutting cycle over the whole period, and a scenario with three timber rotation periods of 30 yr. Two of the later scenarios were complemented with harvesting of the woody LR (o 10 cm) for charcoal production. For each scenario, we computed forest NPP and NEE over a 120 yr time horizon. Results suggest that using woody LR (i.e. 77% of total LR) for charcoal production would result in an economic gain equivalent to 24%-46% of the timber price. Our findings indicate that under scenarios where LR were removed, forest NPP recovered to the reference level and even higher, while income and jobs from harvesting LR for charcoal production were generated. We conclude that SFM could enhance forest productivity and deliver economic benefit from otherwise unexploited LR.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the Brazilian Atlantic forest: A gradient of environmental restoration
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are of great importance for the successful regeneration of degraded natural areas. The objective of this study was to examine how the time of environmental recuperation is affecting the occurrence and diversity of AMF species in riparian areas belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study involved a native forest area (NT) and a gradient of environmental restoration: five (R05), ten (R10), and twenty (R20) years after reforestation. Soil samples were collected in the rainy (January) and dry season (June). Chemical, physical and microbiological analyses were performed including the amount of glomalin and quantification of AMF spores. The frequency of occurrence of genera and ecological indices, as richness (R), Shannon's diversity (H) and Simpson's dominance index (Is) were calculated. The largest spore number was found in R05 and the highest richness and diversity indices of AMF species in NT. Considering the two sampling periods and the four areas studied, we found 22 AMF species, and the genera Glomus and Acaulospora were the most frequent. A Canonical Discriminant Analysis showed that Glomus viscosum, Acaulospora scrobiculata, Acaulospora mellea and Scutellospora heterogama were the species that contributed the most to distinguishing the areas. Moisture, density and glomalin were positively correlated with the number of spores, however, soil nitrate showed a negative correlation. This work gives a better understanding of the interactions between AMF and forest soils and allows to know the distribution of AMF species according to environmental recovery time.

TI  - Diversity Loss of Epigeic Collembola after Grassland Conversion into Eucalyptus Forestry in Brazilian Pampa Domain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Pampa is a rich domain mainly represented by grasslands. Conversion of native vegetation into Eucalyptus plantation leads to soil degradation and losses on local fauna and flora. The objectives of this study were to compare the taxonomic structure and abundance of epigeic springtails (Collembola) in two different types of land-use in the Brazilian Pampa, native grassland and Eucalyptus plantation, as well as to understand the processes that may cause species loss after grassland afforestation. Specimens were sampled in 10 paired plots of grasslands and Eucalyptus in southern Brazil. After sampling, all specimens were sorted, counted and identified. We evaluated the taxonomic composition, alpha and beta diversity, and used Random Forest Analysis to understand the influence of environmental factors on the structure and composition of Collembola communities. We sampled 1249 specimens in 26 morphospecies, and our data support there are significant losses in native Collembola communities after the conversion of grasslands into Eucalyptus plantations regarding abundance, species composition, richness, and alpha diversity. Species turnover better explained the beta diversity, and plant richness and dominance were the main environmental factors driving the Collembola diversity. These results deepen the knowledge of the impacts of native grassland conversion on soil fauna.

TI  - Future perspectives of Brazilian beef production: what is the role of Silvopastoral systems?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the backdrop of changing production conditions and market requirements, it seems time has come to rethink Brazil's beef production systems. We analyse the economic and environmental performance of three beef production systems: classic beef production system (CB), and two types of silvopastoral systems: the integrated crop-livestock-forestry system (ICLFS) and the natural regeneration system (NR) in a comparative case study analysis. We find that, though costs of production are the lowest for CB, only the ICLFS and NR case studies are generating long-term profits. While greenhouse gas emissions per kg live weight added are lowest in ICLFS, followed by NR and CB, per hectare (ha) emissions are highest in NR, followed by ICLFS and CB. Considering the system's carbon removal, NR and potentially ICLFS are sequestering more than releasing. Additionally, the land required to produce beef is lowest in NR, followed by ICLFS and CB. Considering the additional outputs produced by ICLFS and NR, they showcase the potential of multifunctional production systems for future scenarios, where land scarcity puts land-demanding production systems, such as beef, under pressure. The three production systems perform differently depending on the indicators analysed. How they will reply to future challenges depends on the location and the specific environment. Yet, from the analysed systems, CB is the least sustainable, economically and environmentally.

TI  - Modeling organic carbon dynamics under no-tillage and plowed systems in tropical soils of Brazil using CQESTR
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - CQESTR simulates the effect of management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The beta version of the model had been calibrated and validated for temperate regions. our objective was to evaluate the CQESTR model performance for simulating carbon dynamics as affected by tillage practices in two tropical soils (Ultisol and Oxisol) in southeastern and northeastern Brazil. In the southeast (20.75 S 42.81 W), tillage systems consisted of no tillage (NT); reduced tillage (RT) (one disc plow and one harrow leveling [RT1 I or one heavy disc harrow and one harrow leveling [RT2]): and conventional tillage (CT) (two heavy disc harrows followed by one disc plow and two harrow levelings). In the northeast (7.55 S 45.23 W), tillage systems consisted of NT, RT(one chisel plow and one harrow leveling), and CT(one disk plow, two heavy disk harrowings, and two harrow levelings). CQESTR underestimated SOC at both sites, especially under NT systems, indicating that adjustments (e.g., the inclusion of clay mineralogy factor) are necessary for more accurate simulation of SOC in the tropics. In spite of this, measured and simulated values of SOC in the 0-20 cm depth were well correlated (southeast, R-2 = 0.94. p < 0.01; northeast, R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.05). With respect to initial conditions (native forest), CQESTR estimated a decrease in SOC stocks in plowed and no-tillage systems. In 2006, in the southeast, SOC stocks were 28.8, 23.7, 23.2, and 22.0 Mg ha(-1) under NT, RT2, RT1, and CT, respectively; in the northeast, stocks were 36.0, 33.8, and 32.5 Mg ha(-1) under NT, RT, and CT, respectively. The model estimated carbon emissions varying from 0.36 (NT) to 1.05 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (CT) in the southeast and from 0.30 (NT) to 0.82 (CT) Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the northeast. CQESTR prediction of SOC dynamics illustrates acceptable performance for the two tropical soils of Brazil. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regional variation in responses of a vulnerable bird species to land-use and climate change
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material

TI  - Storage and forms of organic carbon in a no-tillage under cover crops system on clayey Oxisol in dryland rice production (Cerrados, Brazil)
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The management and enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) is very important for agriculture (fertility) as well as for the environment (carbon (C) sequestration). Consequently, changes in soil management may alter SOC content. No-tillage (NT) practices are potential ways to increase SOC. We studied the SOC from agricultural soils in the Cerrados in Central Brazil. We compared two different tillage systems: conservation agriculture with no-tillage under cover crops (NT) and disc tillage (DT) for 5 years in a context of rainfed rice production. The soil is a dark red Oxisol with high clay content (about 40%). The objectives of the study were: (i) to evaluate the short-term (5 years) impact of tillage systems on SOC stocks in an Oxisol and (ii) to better understand the dynamics of SOC in different fractions of this soil. We first studied the initial situation in 1998, and compared it to the 2003 situation. NT with cover crop (Crotalaria) was found to increase the storage of C in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) compared to DT. The difference observed for the 0-10 cm layer under NT in comparison with DT represented C enrichment under no-tillage amounting to 0.35 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and corresponding to less than 10% of cover crops residues returned to the soil. A particle-size fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM) showed that differences in total SOC between NT and DT mainly affected the 0-2 mu m fraction and, to a smaller extent the 2-20 mu m fraction.This specific enrichment of SOC in the silt and clay fraction was attributed to (i) the storage of a water soluble C in the field and (ii) the effect of soil biota and especially fauna activity. The mean residence time of carbon associated with the fine fractions being rather long, it might be assumed that the preferential storage in fine fractions resulted in a long-term carbon storage. This study suggests a positive short-term effect of a no-tillage system on C sequestration in an Oxisol. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The introduction of crop management practices after conversion of Amazon Cerrado into cropland influences soil C stocks and has direct and indirect consequences on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The aim of this study was to quantify soil C sequestration, through the evaluation of the changes in C stocks, as well as the GHG fluxes (N2O and CH4) during the process of conversion of Cerrado into agricultural land in the southwestern Amazon region, comparing no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. We collected samples from soils and made gas flux measurements in July 2004 (the dry season) and in January 2005 (the wet season) at six areas: Cerrado, CT cultivated with rice for 1 year (1CT) and 2 years (2CT), and NT cultivated with soybean for 1 year (1NT), 2 years (2NT) and 3 years (3NT), in each case after a 2-year period of rice under CT. Soil samples were analyzed in both seasons for total organic C and bulk density. The soil C stocks, corrected for a mass of soil equivalent to the 0-30-cm layer under Cerrado, indicated that soils under NT had generally higher C storage compared to native Cerrado and CT soils. The annual C accumulation rate in the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.38 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Although CO2 emissions were not used in the C sequestration estimates to avoid double counting, we did include the fluxes of this gas in our discussion. In the wet season, CO2 emissions were twice as high as in the dry season and the highest N2O emissions occurred under the NT system. There were no CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (negative fluxes) and there were no significant seasonal variations. When N2O and CH4 emissions in C-equivalent were subtracted (assuming that the measurements made on 4 days were representative of the whole year), the soil C sequestration rate of the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.23 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Although there were positive soil C sequestration rates, our results do not present data regarding the full C balance in soil management changes in the Amazon Cerrado. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term loblolly pine land use reduces methane and net greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical Cambisol, despite increasing nitrous oxide
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - circle Key message In loblolly pine land use of 17-32 years following forest clearing, CH(4)consumption and N2O emission diminished by 17 years, due to high soil moisture (similar to 80% WFPS, N2O into N-2), but increased by 32 years, where medium moisture favoured methanotrophy and denitrification into N2O. Soil greenhouse gases (GHG) emission was positive by 17 years, but negative by 32, when soil sequestered carbon. circle Context Much of the role of planted forests in the gaseous soil-atmosphere exchanges in the subtropics remains to be evaluated. circle Aims To assess the impacts of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a subtropical Cambisol. circle Methods Fluxes were monitored over 1 year with static chambers, in forest stands under natural forest (NF) and pine plantation for 17 (P17) and 32 years (P32). circle Results The NF soil showed the lowest N2O emission and the highest CH4 consumption, because of the lowest water-filled pore space (WFPS, < 40%) and highest soil macroporosity. In P17, N2O emission was still low, but CH4 consumption diminished sixfold, possibly because of the predominance of methanotrophy, favoured by the highest WFPS (similar to 80%) and lowest macroporosity that together with low mineral N concentration also did not favour the formation of N2O. In P32, the improved soil mineral N, macroporosity and intermediate WFPS ( similar to 60%) increased CH4 consumption and also N2O emission, in an environment supposedly favourable to methanotrophy and also to N2O production. Considering soil organic carbon (SOC) from a concurrent study, the net GHG emission (Mg C-eq ha(-1) year(-1)) was 2.8 in P17 and - 1.1 in P32. circle Conclusion Soil under pine plantation is the source of GHG in the first rotation (17 years), because of the low CH4 consumption and SOC losses, but soil becomes C sink in the second rotation (32 years), by sequestering SOC and consuming more CH4, despite emitting more N2O.

TI  - Agroforestry transitions: The good, the bad and the ugly
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article canvasses the current definitions and framings of ?agroforestry? in different academic literature and policies. Three key framings of ?agroforestry? are identified in the scholarship and explored for their differences. The findings suggest that the distinct schools of research on ?agroforestry? focus on distinct points of departure, and these baseline situations from which transitions to what is called ?agroforestry? occur vary in distinct ways from monoculture plantations to primary forests. Political-economic analysis is used to scrutinize three key ?agroforestry? transition categories: agroecological, agribusiness, and forest degradation, which the article identifies as agroecoforestry (the good), agrobizforestry (the bad), and agrodeforestry (the ugly) transitions, respectively. Examples of each type are provided based on field research in Brazil, and the results are put into a global perspective. The categories are helpful in identifying the ?agroforestry? transitions that are currently marketed as good solutions but might also have negative impacts and in highlighting the agroecological agroforestry transitions that would help simultaneously increase global food production, adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis, and achieve equity and social justice.

TI  - Reemergence of Yellow Fever in Brazil: The Role of Distinct Landscape Fragmentation Thresholds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) reemergence in Brazil was followed by human suffering and the loss of biodiversity of neotropical simians on the Atlantic coast. The underlying mechanisms were investigated with special focus on distinct landscape fragmentation thresholds in the affected municipalities. An ecological study in epidemiology is employed to assess the statistical relationship between events of YFV and forest fragmentation in municipal landscapes. Negative binomial regression model showed that highly fragmented forest cover was associated with an 85% increase of events of YFV in humans and simians (RR = 1.85, CI 95% = 1.24-2.75, p=0.003) adjusted by vaccine coverage, population size, and municipality area. Intermediate levels of forest cover combined with higher levels of forest edge densities contribute to the YFV dispersion and the exponential growth of YF cases. Strategies for forest conservation are necessary for the control and prevention of YF and other zoonotic diseases that can spillover from the fragmented forest remains to populated cities of the Brazilian Atlantic coast.

TI  - The 2015 Borneo fires: What have we learned from the 1997 and 2006 El Ninos?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire activity in Indonesia is strongly linked with El Nino events, whose sea surface temperature (SST) patterns can weaken the Walker circulation to induce drought conditions in the region. Here we show via case analyses and idealized climate model simulations that it is the central location of the SST anomalies associated with El Nino, rather than its strength, that is mostly linked with the fire occurrence. During our study period of 1997-2015, Eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino events produced the largest fire events in southern Borneo (i. e., in 1997, 2006, and 2015), while Central Pacific (CP) El Nino events consistently produced minor fire events. The EP El Nino is found to be more capable than the CP El Nino of weakening the Walker circulation that acts to prolong Borneo's drought condition from September to October. The extended dry conditions in October potentially increase the occurrence of fires during EP El Nino years. The 2015 fire event owes its occurrence to the location of the 2015 El Nino but not necessarily its 'Godzilla' strength in affecting the fire episodes over southern Borneo. Projecting the location of El Nino events might be more important than projecting their strength for fire management in southern Borneo.

TI  - Soil physical attributes and organic matter accumulation under no-tillage systems in the Cerrado
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil management has a major effect on soil physical characteristics, and consequently on soil organic matter (SOM) content, which are important for the success of crop production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the soil physical attributes and the accumulation of SOM in no-tillage systems (NTS) with different periods of implantation in a conventional tillage area and to compare them with native forest (NF) in the Cerrado biome. The experiment was planned in a 3 x 4 factorial scheme, consisting of three soil treatments (NTS for 17 years (NTS17), NTS for 5 years (NTS5) and NF) and four soil depths (0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3 and 0.3-0.4 m), with a completely randomised design and four replicates. At deep soil layers (0.2-0.4 m) the NTS17 area had a greater soil density than the NTS5 and NF areas, and greater SOM compared with the NTS5 area. Soil macroporosity in the NTS5 area was below 10% at all soil depths evaluated. The NF area had the greatest total organic carbon content (1.39 dag kg(-1)), stock of carbon (16.63 Mg ha(--1)), amount of soil organic matter (28.66 Mg ha(--1)) and equivalent carbon credits (60.96 Mg ha(-1)). Carbon stocks were similar in the NTS areas in all soil depths evaluated. The results indicate that conventional tillage areas can be successfully recovered under the Cerrado edaphoclimatic conditions with the implantation of an NTS.

TI  - Shifting cultivation, contentious land change and forest governance: the politics of swidden in East Kalimantan
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Swidden has historically been one of the most widespread land uses in upland Southeast Asia. In recent decades, swidden systems across the region have undergone rapid transformation. While most analyses focus on swidden as a livelihood practice, we direct attention to the political nature of swidden. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork and household surveys from two villages in East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, we examine the politics of swidden along two key dimensions. First, at the household level, we describe swidden as a land control strategy. We identify territorialization and speculation as drivers of 'contentious land change' in swidden systems under pressure from expanding plantations and mines. Second, at the village and district levels, we examine the politics of swidden within new forest governance arrangements. Control of swidden has provided a focus for multi-stakeholder forest governance, but with ambivalent effects, developing village land management and livelihoods at a cost of temporary increases in swidden clearing and with minimal impact on deforestation for industrial land uses. Our analysis suggests forest governance efforts will be ineffective in eliminating contentious land change or reducing district-level deforestation until they address plantation and mining expansion as the dominant direct and indirect drivers of forest conversion.

TI  - Depth assessed and up-scaling of single case studies might overestimate the role of C sequestration by pastures in the commitments of Brazil's low-carbon agriculture plan
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The reclamation of degraded pastures has a prominent role in the Brazilian climate policy and is one of the main strategies of Brazil's Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan). Here, we aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks in livestock areas under pasture reclamation and contribute to the empirical basis for evaluating the ABC Plan. Based on the assessment of six chronosequences across Brazilian Cerrado, we observed that the effects of management practices for pasture reclamation on soil C and N stocks in livestock areas were quite variable. Any general tendencies depend on the depth evaluated. At the 0-30 cm soil layer, pasture areas under reclamation in Brazilian Cerrado showed an average soil C change rate of 0.47 Mg C ha(-1 )yr(-1). However, for the more in-depth assessment (0-100 cm), the adoption of management practices for pasture reclamation did not affect the average rate of soil C changes for these areas. In this sense, we suggest that an up-scaling from single case studies may lead to overestimations of soil C inventories. Thefore, ABC Plan must review some of its approaches based on general values and extrapolations regarding C sequestration in pasture areas.

TI  - Melissopalynology of honey from the tropical central corridor of the Atlantic Forest, Bahia State, Brazil
T2  - GRANA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest is noted for its biodiversity of flora and fauna, with a high number of endemic species. Studies that characterise the tropical bee flora and bee products in these areas are scarce. This study therefore sought to characterise the pollen spectrum of honey from Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera, Apidae) in some municipalities found in the Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest, in Bahia, Brazil. A total of 16 honey samples from Belmonte, Camacan, Eunapolis, Itabela, Itabuna, Ilheus, Medeiros Neto, and Valenca were analysed. The honey was acetolysed and the mounted slides were analysed under light microscopy, from which at least 500 pollen types per sample were counted. In total, 60 pollen types with botanically determined origin were found, comprising 52 genera in 24 families. For this study, pollen types having a prevalence equal to or greater than 10% in the samples were emphasised. Thus, we found 14 most representative pollen types, related to eight families. Fabaceae was the richest, with a total of four recorded pollen types, of which Mimosa pudica stood out, found in 56.2% of samples. Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) had a high frequency distribution, especially in Belmonte, Eunapolis, Valenca, and Medeiros Neto, where it was a predominant pollen, due to reforestation with Eucalyptus spp. for commercial purposes in these municipalities. In addition, Alternanthera brasiliana and Chamaecrista were predominant pollen in samples from Camacan and Medeiros Neto, respectively. The similarity analysis revealed the environmental heterogeneity of this tropical region.

TI  - Do we need intervention after pine tree removal? The use of different management techniques to enhance Cerrado natural regeneration
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Some Cerrado areas are suppressed by pine tree cultivation. These monoculture processes can exclude the fire presence and inhibit native species development. In Southeastern Brazil, thousands of hectares were planted with these exotic trees 44 years ago, and nowadays, efforts to remove these plantations and restore the native vegetation are being implemented. However, little is known about the regeneration of Cerrado after pine removal. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the native plant community of Cerrado, using some techniques to enhance species natural regeneration three years after pine trees removal in areas where plantations existed since 1966. Before treatments application, surveys of the herbaceous and woody community were conducted, followed by the treatment application (fire and the removal of needles) as a management intervention. Moreover, we established control plots, with no intervention. Four and 30 months after treatment application, the herbaceous and woody vegetation, as well as the dead biomass and bare soil components were monitored to observe their regeneration. The pine removal contributed to species development and both techniques contributed to soil exposition, opening space for colonization and species to resprout. The woody and herbaceous group increased in cover, mostly in fire plots, due to the soil exposition increasing light and contributing to species development.

TI  - Assessing the Most Irreplaceable Protected Areas for the Conservation of Mammals in the Atlantic Forest: Lessons for the Governance of Mosaics
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have gathered 21,353 records of 40 different medium- and large-sized species of mammals existing in the Atlantic Forest conservation units of Brazil, including full protection and sustainable use types of management. We have classified the conservation units by their irreplaceability in terms of their role in the protection of mammalian species. Most irreplaceable conservation units are concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, mainly in the states of Rio de Janeiro, SAo Paulo and Parana. Our data show that over and above the area of the conservation unit or its type of use, protection of its surroundings appears to be of most consequence. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective mosaic governance mechanisms that include protected areas and different types of land use. However, it is also necessary to establish common ground that allows the coexistence of human economic demands and wildlife preservation.

TI  - Lycophytes and ferns composition of Atlantic Forest conservation units in western Parana with comparisons to other areas in southern Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study surveyed lycophyte and fern species in four forest fragments in western Parana, Brazil, and compared them to 15 other fragments with different plant formations from the Atlantic Forest biome in southern Brazil. In total, five lycophyte species (in two families and two genera) and 98 species and two varieties of ferns (in 16 families and 38 genera) were registered in the four fragments. The most represented families were Pteridaceae (23 spp.), Polypodiaceae (18 spp.), Aspleniaceae (13 spp.), and Thelypteridaceae (11 spp.). Asplenium (12 spp.), Thelypteris (10 spp.), and Blechnum (seven spp.) were among the most represented genera. The occurrence of Dicksonia sellowiana was noteworthy because it was associated with seasonal semideciduous forest and is threatened in Brazil. Similarity among areas was determined by a cluster analysis (UPGMA and Sorensen's index) and the relation between similarity and geographic distance was determined through Matel's analysis. The analyses revealed greater similarity among the four study areas and, for these areas as a whole, greater similarity to fragments in Rio Grande do Sul, which is evidence that these areas have similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Developing conservation priorities based on forest type, condition, and threats in a poorly known ecoregion: Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The island of Sulawesi is the largest in Indonesian Wallacea, one of the most important ecoregions in SE Asia and globally. Here, we generate a comprehensive and detailed map of forest type, its condition, and some of its threats, which highlights key forest conservation areas, pinpoints frontlines within them, and provides the basis for the development of more specific objectives. We relied upon a variety of techniques to generate five main descriptors of forest quality: condition, its level of endangerment, its landscape setting, its simulated fate given a simple model of forest change, and its overall size. Using the results of this analysis, we assessed the existing protected areas (PA), recognized by the Indonesian government, and a conservation portfolio (CP) generated by a recently completed Ecoregional Conservation Assessment (ECA). Our map of conservation priorities is congruent with previous conservation activities, although several priority areas were identified outside of the current PA system and should be the focus of strategic protected area development. Our ranking system is simple, transparent, and flexible. Its modular construction will allow local managers to choose among available proxy measures and to add their own conservation values according to specific priorities and desired outcomes. We envision this analysis as the foundation upon which more specific conservation strategies, based upon detailed biotic information as it becomes available, can be developed.

TI  - Soil organic carbon and biological indicators in an Acrisol under tillage systems and organic management in north-eastern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-tillage and organic farming are important strategies to improve soil quality. This study aimed to quantify the effects of the tillage systems and organic management on total organic carbon (TOC), labile C ( CL), and biological indicators in an Acrisol in north-eastern Brazil. Five systems were studied: NV, native vegetation; NT/ORG, no-tillage plus organic fertiliser; NT/CHE, no-tillage plus chemical fertiliser; NT/CHE/ORG, no-tillage plus organic and chemical fertiliser; CT/CHE, conventional tillage plus chemical fertiliser. Soil samples were collected in the 0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20m depths. TOC stocks were higher in NT/CHE/ORG (0-0.10 m, 14.0 Mg/ha; 0.10-0.20 m, 13.0 Mg/ha) and NT/ORG (0-0.10 m, 12.6 Mg/ha; 0.10-0.20 m, 11.6 Mg/ha) than in CT/CHE and NV systems. CL stocks were higher in NT/ORG (3.61 Mg/ha) at 0-0.10m and in NT/ORG, NT/CHE, and NT/CHE/ORG at 0.10-0.20 m. At 0-0.10 m, microbial biomass C content was higher in the NT/CHE/ORG (190 mg/kg) and NT/ORG (155 mg/kg). Soil microbial respiration rate was similar in all systems. However, qCO(2) was higher in the NT/CHE and CT/CHE systems, suggesting a stress in the soil microbial biomass. No-tillage and organic management promoted positive changes in soil organic carbon and soil microbial properties and improved soil quality.

T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a key ecological factor affecting biodiversity structure and composition. Fires' effects on biodiversity can be beneficial or harmful depending on how, where, when, and why they occur. The impacts of fire on fauna vary according to species ecology and the fire regime. To understand the research effort relating fire, fauna, and mammals, we surveyed papers published in World and in Brazil. Only 5% of the publications between 1970 and 2019 with fire subject dealt with fauna and 0.5% with mammal. For Brazil, we obtained 7% of papers for fauna and 3% for mammal. The Brazilian Biome with more papers was Cerrado, followed by Atlantic Forest, Amazon, Pampas, Caatinga and Pantanal. The United States of America and Australia stand out as protagonists in their continents with the largest papers number. The volume of research is related to investment in Research and Development and to occurrence of fires. The slope of temporal trend shows the terms related to wildfire have more papers than prescribed burn and there is less interest in fauna and mammal research. It is necessary to form research groups with these themes as research lines and intensify research relating fire ecology and mammals. There is yet no unified understanding of how fire may influence animal diversity and how it influences the vegetative structure and subsequently the resources which wildlife rely on. We consider this information is essential to establish efficient conservation policies.

TI  - Fluxes of nitrous oxide from soil under different crop rotations and tillage systems in the South of Brazil
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The zero tillage (ZT) system is used in a large area (> 24 Mha) of crop production in Brazil. This management system can contribute to soil C sequestration, but many studies in other countries have registered greater nitrous oxide emissions under ZT compared to conventional tillage (CT), which may reduce greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. The aim of this study was to estimate the emission of N2O from cropping systems under conventional and zero tillage in an 18-year-old experiment conducted on a Rhodic Ferralsol in the South of Brazil. Fluxes of N2O were measured over two years using static-closed chambers in the two tillage systems with three crop rotations. Soil water filled pore space (% WFPS) and soil mineral N were monitored along with rainfall and air temperature. Estimates of N2O emissions were obtained by integrating the fluxes with time and also by applying the IPCC direct emission factor (EF1 = 1%) to the amounts of N added as fertilisers and returned as crop residues. Fluxes of N2O were relatively low, apart from a short period at the beginning of measurements. No relationship between N2O fluxes and % WFPS or mineral N were observed. Nitrous oxide emissions were not influenced either by tillage system or crop rotation. For the crop rotation receiving high rates of N fertiliser in the second year, field-measured N2O emissions were significantly underestimated by the IPCC emission factor 1 (EF1). For the other treatments measured N2O emissions fell within the EF1 uncertainty range, but always considerably lower than the EF1 estimate, which suggests IPCC EF1 overestimates true N2O emissions for the Ferralsol under evaluation.

TI  - Organic matter dynamics and carbon sequestration rates for a tillage chronosequence in a Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Amounts and rates of C sequestration under no-tillage are not known for a major ecological region of south Brazil. These were assessed in a Brazilian Oxisol under a plow and no-tillage chronosequence located in Parana State. The chronosequence consisted of six treatments: (i) native field (NF); (ii) 1-yr plow conversion of native field to cropland (PNF-1); (iii) no-tillage for 10 yr (NT-10); (iv) no-tillage for 20 yr (NT-20); (v) no-tillage for 22 yr (NT-22); and (vi) conventional tillage for 22 yr (CT-22). Soil samples were collected from five depths. No-tillage, compared with the NF treatment, caused a significant increase in soil organic C (SOC) storage. More than 60% of this increase occurred in the 0- to 10-cm soil layer. There was a decrease in the amount of SOC in the CT-22 compared with the NF soil treatment and 97% of this loss also occurred in the 0- to 10-cm layer. There was a close relationship between the SOC content and the amount of crop residues input (R-2 = 0.74, P less than or equal to 0.05). There were increased SOC concentrations in the finer particle-size fractions (< 20 mum) of no-tillage surface soil compared with the NF or CT-22 soils. However, the percentage of SOC derived from crop residues in notillage treatments, as assessed by 13C natural abundance (delta), was generally greater in the coarse (< 20 mum) than in the finer (< 20 mum) particle-size fractions. The C sequestration rate for no-tillage was 80.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the 0- to 20-cm depth and 99.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the 0- to 40-cm depth. The no-tillage C sequestration potential for South Brazil was estimated as 9.37 Tg C yr(-1).

TI  - Assessing fire risk and safeguarding Brazil's biomes: a Multifactorial Approach
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in Brazil play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and the environment, but this has been threatened by deforestation, forest fires, and the effects of climate change. Among these, forest fire has happened frequently in areas where there have been changes in land use for activities of agriculture and livestock farming, that motivate the destruction of forests particularly in biomes like the Amazon and Cerrado. In those biomes, the forest fires initiated to clear land for pasture are the most worrying because promote ecological and socioeconomic consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and impacts the regional flora and biogeochemical cycles. As a strategy to understand and identify areas at risk of forest fires, this study aimed to develop a risk zoning framework for fire hotspots in the biomes of Brazilians. This framework combines multiple variables, incorporating factors like physical terrain, land use, and climatic data, to assess the potential fire risk. The areas with greater fire risk are located in the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, in which the physical and climate variables influence directly in incidence and propagation of fire. In the Amazon biome there is a fire risk, some possibly intentional, but can be regulated by elevated precipitation in the region. The identification of areas at high fire risk allows the implementation of proactive strategies for fire prevention for safeguarding Brazil's biomes and ecosystems, which are integral to the environment and biodiversity.

T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The planning and management of street trees are indispensable for sustainable urban development and requires knowledge of the existing situation. The identification of forest species which are present on streets and their distributions is essential to support the adequate planning of street afforestation. This information enables to carry out the general characterization of the place of interest and identify priority areas for management actions. Thus, the present study aimed to identify priority areas for interventions in urban street trees of Sao Pedro do Sul and to verify the influence of exotic species on the diversity index. A census was carried out collecting information about the tree species and their geographic positions, checking it with the specialized literature. The frequencies for families and species were obtained, the Shannon-Wiener index (H ') was calculated for species diversity. The spatialization of trees within the limits of neighborhoods and roads was carried out using a Kernel map. Finally, the density of individuals per kilometer of road in each neighborhood was obtained. 3365 trees were cataloged, of which 98 were not possible to be identifiable. The presence of 91 species was registered, distributed in 34 families. The Fabaceae family obtained the highest density of individuals (19.55%). Exotic species concentrated 63.98 % of the population, with Ligustrum lucidum being the most frequent species (15.66%). The municipality obtained average values of 41.18 trees per kilometer of road and a diversity index of 3.22. The attention index made it possible to identify the neighborhoods with the greatest need for adaptation in terms of the density of road afforestation. The Kernel map made it possible to visualize the distribution of the road afforestation. It was also observed that the diversity of tree species measured in each neighborhood is represented essentially by invasive alien species and that as the diversity values increase, the composition of afforestation with invasive species trees stands out.

TI  - Can silvopasture with arboreal legumes increase root mass at deeper soil layers and improve soil aggregation?
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral system (SPS) is a multifunctional agroforestry practice. This study evaluate soil properties and root biomass under SPS in Pernambuco, Brazil. The experiment was established in 2011. The treatments were (1) monoculture signalgrass (MS) [Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. D. Webster], (2) intercropped pasture of signalgrass with legume Gliricidia (SG) [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud.], and (3) intercropped pasture of signalgrass with legume sabi & aacute; (SS) (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth). Treatments were allocated in randomized complete block design with three replications. Samples were collected at 0- to 10-, 10- to 20-, 20- to 40-, 40- to 60-, 60- to 80-, 80- to 100-, and 100- to 120-cm soil depths. Soil samples were also taken from the native forest (NF) considered as a reference at the same Experimental Station. Legume SPS (SG and SS) presented greater root biomass per unit area compared to MS at 60- to 80-cm depth (p < 0.05); however, MS had greater root biomass per hectare at the top layers. The average values of the weighted mean diameter of soil aggregates were 3.20, 3.19, 3.07, and 3.27 mm in MS, SG, SS, and NF, respectively, at 0- to 120-cm depths. The SPS increased soil cation exchange capacity in deeper layers, indicating greater biological activity at greater depth. Grasslands and SPS store 235 Mg C ha-1 with 71% of that found in deeper layers (20-120 cm). SPS with signalgrass intercropped with arboreal legumes has potential to improve deep soil C storage and resilience of livestock systems in tropical regions.

TI  - Changes in soil organic carbon storage under different agricultural management systems in the Southwest Amazon Region of Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado and Amazon regions of Brazil are probably the largest agricultural frontier of the world, and Could be a sink or source for C depending on the net effect of land use change and subsequent management on soil organic C pools. We evaluated the effects of agricultural management systems on soil organic C (SOC) stocks in the Brazilian states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso, and derived regional specific factors for soil C stock change associated with different management systems. We used 50 observations (data points) in this study, including 42 dealing with annual cropping practices and 8 dealing with perennial cropping, and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. No tillage (NT) systems in Cerrado areas increased SOC Storage by 1.08 +/- 0.06 relative to SOC stocks under native conditions, while SOC storage increased by a modest factor of 1.01 +/- 0.17 in Cerradao and Amazon Forest conditions.Full tillage (FT) had negative effect on SOC storage relative to NT, decreasing SOC stocks by a factor of 0.94 +/- 0.04. but did not significantly reduce SOC stocks relative to native levels when adopted in the Cerrado region. Perennial cropping had a minimal impact on SOC stocks, estimated at a factor Value of 0.98 +/- 0.14, suggesting these systems maintain about 98% of the SOC stock found under native vegetation. The results Suggest that NT adoption may be increasing SOC with land use change from native vegetation to cropland management in the Cerrado region of Brazil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The potential of natural shade provided by Brazilian savanna trees for thermal comfort and carbon sink
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study looked at the potential of thermal comfort provided to animals by four different Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) native trees, as well as their potential for carbon sink. The evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020, which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables. The Mean Radiant Temperature (TMR, degrees C) was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees, and from that, the Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W m(-2)) was calcu-lated as an index of thermal comfort. Solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct, diffuse, and reflected components (W m(-2)), and carbon stock from trees biomass for CO2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native Cerrado tree species. The shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures, to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals, with an average reduction respectively equal to 1.3 degrees C and 6.4 degrees C. This represents a significant difference com-pared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species (P < 0.05), reflecting in lower values of TMR and RHL in the shaded area provided by each species. Carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 8.85 Mg per tree. These results demonstrate the great potential for native tree species in the Cerrado biome to be used in agroforestry systems to provide higher levels of thermal comfort to animals and to combat climate change through their aptitude of CO2 sink.

AB  - In this study aspects of floristic composition were discussed, species diversity and diameter structure of a managed forest, in the county of Paragominas, Para. The data were obtained in two transects of 100 x 900 m, corresponding to a sample area of 18 ha, measured on seven annual occasions. The trees were classified into two inclusion levels, Level 1: DBH >= 20 cm in plots of 100 x 100 m and Level 2: 10 cm < DBH <= 20 cm in subplots of 25 x 50 m. Shannon-Weaver's index ranged from 3.97 to 4.03 nats ind(-1) for Level 1 and 3.80 and 4.03 nats ind(-1) for Level 2. The ecological groups composed of non-pioneer dominated the forest, both in terms of richness and density of trees. The results indicated that 10 years after the exploration, no significant changes were observed in the richness, diversity and diametric structure of the vegetation, possibly indicating that the forest when submitted to the sustainable forest management should maintain its characteristics near the forest not disturbed by the logging.

AB  - Studies on applying of soil management practices in the management of parica and the effects on growth and yield are essential to auxiliary its cultivation and would allow us to inform management and conservation decisions to reconciliate biodiversity, wellbeing, and sustainable production. This case study aimed to evaluate the growth and yield of parica at different soil management practices, including consortium with an agricultural production, in the Brazilian Amazon. Parica was implanted, consorted with soybean in the first year, and maize in the second, in a 5 x 2 m spacing. The treatments T1 = subsoiling, basal dressing, top-dressing, inoculation of microorganisms and consortium with soybean/maize were applied. In T2, T3, T4, and T5, we applied the same practices of T1, except subsoiling (T2), basal dressing (T3), top-dressing (T4) and inoculation of microorganisms (T5). T6 was the control, which used none of these practices, including the consortium with soybean/maize. The results indicate that the highest rate of plant survival occurred in T2, while T3 and T4 promoted greater intraspecific competition, compromising the growth in dbh and the yield (m(3) ha(-1)) of plants in future ages. Growth in dbh and th and the yield of plants in the soybean/maize consortium period was higher in T2 and T6. In future ages, the dbh and yield of plants demonstrated higher growth trends in T6, T1, and T5. Agroforestry practices of soil management influence the growth and yield of parica plants. However, there is a tendency for greater growth and yield for parica plants cultivated in the absence of agroforestry practices for soil management proposed in this case study. When opting for AFS (parica intercropped with soybean and maize), it is recommended for parica a subsoiling, fertilization, and inoculation of microorganisms.

TI  - Large scale multi-layer fuel load characterization in tropical savanna using GEDI spaceborne lidar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying fuel load over large areas is essential to support integrated fire management initiatives in fire-prone regions to preserve carbon stock, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.

TI  - Biomass accumulation after 10-200 years of shifting cultivation in bornean rain forest
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - I examined the effect of repeated long-fallow shifting cultivation on biomass accumulation in a rain-forest landscape occupied for over 200 years in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, The diameters of stems >5 cm dbh were measured in nine secondary forests using a stratified random design of nested plots (3000 m(2) per site). The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from I to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance.

TI  - The expansion of tree plantations across tropical biomes
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in agricultural practices have led to the expansion of tree plantations across the tropics, but this expansion is poorly characterized. Nearly 7 million unique patches of observed tree cover gain are classified through satellite imagery to report on tropical tree plantation expansion between 2000 and 2012.Across the tropics, recent agricultural shifts have led to a rapid expansion of tree plantations, often into intact forests and grasslands. However, this expansion is poorly characterized. Here, we report tropical tree plantation expansion between 2000 and 2012, based on classifying nearly 7 million unique patches of observed tree cover gain using optical and radar satellite imagery. The resulting map was a subsample of all tree cover gain but we coupled it with an extensive random accuracy assessment (n = 4,269 points) to provide unbiased estimates of expansion. Most predicted gain patches (69.2%) consisted of small patches of natural regrowth (31.6 +/- 11.9 Mha). However, expansion of tree plantations also dominated increases in tree cover across the tropics (32.2 +/- 9.4 Mha) with 92% of predicted plantation expansion occurring in biodiversity hotspots and 14% in arid biomes. We estimate that tree plantations expanded into 9.2% of accessible protected areas across the humid tropics, most frequently in southeast Asia, west Africa and Brazil. Given international tree planting commitments, it is critical to understand how future tree plantation expansion will affect remaining natural ecosystems.

TI  - Tillage systems effects on soil carbon stock and physical fractions of soil organic matter
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in soil management and land use influence soil organic matter (SUM) turnover through changes in quantity and quality of plant residues entering the soil, their seasonal and spatial distribution, the ratio between above- and bellow-ground inputs and through changes in soil disturbance. We hypothesized that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction (C associated in sand, silt and clay fraction). The objective of this study was to evaluate the C stock and stabilization in a tropical Dystrophic Red Latosol (Typic Haplortox) (Paty do Alferes, Brazil) subjected to 6-years soil tillage systems and soil cover. Treatments included no-tillage (NT), animal traction (AT) and conventional tillage (CT). Two additional treatments were evaluated: grass coverage (GC) and bare soil (BS). After six years crop, soil C stock in the 0-10 cm layer was higher in NT than in CT (17.6 vs. 12.3 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05). It resulted an increase of 5.3 Mg C ha-1 in NT when comparing to CT. In NT, most of the C accumulation compared to CT occurred in the mineral associated fraction. Although, only the C associated in sand fraction was statistically different (6.7 vs. 1.2 g kg(-1) soil, P < 0.05). GC had the highest C sequestration and C and N associated in the mineral fraction (14.9 g C kg(-1) and 5.1 g N kg(-1)) in the 0-5 cm depth. For all treatments, most of the soil organic C was in the heavy fraction (> 55%). GC incorporated to soil annually 0.6 Mg C ha-1. C associated with sand fractions was the most sensible mineral associated C fraction compared to C in silt and clay fraction, and can be used as a suitable soil quality indicator for sustainable use.

TI  - Vulnerability of bird species in highly fragmented forests of southern Brazil: implications for conservation
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) is the most threatened vegetation type of Parana state. Protecting large extensions of pristine forest is essential to prevent biodiversity loss, but evaluating the potential of anthropogenic areas in maintaining biodiversity is important in highly fragmented landscapes. Here, we studied the avifauna of Parana SSF in several habitats (RE, pristine forest considered as reference sites; LF, large forest fragments; MF, middle-sized forest fragments; SF, small forest fragments; UF, urban forest fragments; AF, agricultural fields; RA, reforestation areas) aiming to investigate which are the most vulnerable species in this vegetation type. In order to do so, we categorized each species according to habitat specialization, level of threat, and level of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. We also measured the similarity in bird species composition among six habitat categories with different types of anthropogenic disturbance (LF, MF, SF, UF, AF, and RA). We recorded 368 terrestrial bird species, of which 41 were considered to be vulnerable due to being forest specialist birds that were also sensitive and/or threatened. Sensitive and/or threatened species were rarely found in UF, AF, and RA (1-3 species). Therefore, large forests such as RE are of vital importance to bird species conservation. The similarity in bird species composition among LF, MF, and SF indicates that general ecological functions of birds could be similar in these habitats, suggesting that the conservation of forest fragments is important for the maintenance of bird community functionality in the present Parana SSF.

TI  - Examining the Adequacy of Legal and Institutional Frameworks of Land and Forest Fire Management from National to Community Levels in Indonesia
T2  - DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN INDONESIA: PROGRESS, CHALLENGES, AND ISSUES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Land and forest fires are increasingly becoming annual disasters in Indonesia and have a significant impact on biodiversity, health, the economy and carbon dioxide emissions. Human activities such as the clearing of forests and land for plantations and agriculture have been attributed as the major causes of these fires. They have also been associated with the impacts of El-Nino.This chapter aims to examine the adequacy of current legal and institutional frameworks for land and forest fire risk management (LFFRM) in Indonesia, from the national to local level, through utilizing a disaster risk management approach, and thereby assess progress and challenges in managing land and forest fires during the prevention and mitigation, emergency response and post-fires rehabilitation and recovery phases. This study involves a literature review of related government regulations and academic publications, as well as interviews with government officials, the community and NGOs at the local level, conducted in two provinces: South Sumatra and Central Kalimantan.The study has three major findings. First, the institutional and regulatory framework for managing land/peatland fires is not integrated with that of forest fires. Second, a lack of law enforcement hinders prevention and mitigation. Third, current institutional and regulatory frameworks are still very much focused on emergency response. Moreover, progress is slower at lower levels of governance and community livelihood has failed to be integrated into the process. We recommend that governments, from the national to sub-national and local levels, develop a more comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach with community-based livelihood activities at its core, and commit to stricter law enforcement, especially for those private sector companies responsible for large-scale fires.

TI  - Soil organic carbon sequestration under Araucaria angustifolia plantations but not under exotic tree species on a mountain range
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forests can be efficient C sinks in biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC), but the latter depends on many factors, including climate. Tropical humid, mountain areas have cooler temperatures, slowing microbial decomposition, and thus can store considerable SOC. However, the effects of forest plantations on SOC of these montane areas are still poorly studied. Here, we aimed to assess changes in SOC, and related soil properties, after conversion of native rainforest to plantations of five tree species, with rotation cycles varying from 7 to 30 years, on the Mantiqueira Range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We measured SOC contents and stocks (0.00-0.40 m layer) under a native montane rainforest (control) and plantations of Eucalyptus, Pinus, Cunninghamia, Cupressus and Araucaria, all planted in 3 x 3 m spacing, at an altitude of ca. 1,300 m, marked by humid and cool climate, where SOC contents are naturally high. Soil organic carbon varied from 55 g kg(-1) under Eucalyptus to 105 g kg(-1) under Araucaria (0.00-0.05 m layer), decreasing in depth (0.20-0.40 m) to the still high values of 20-40 g kg(-1). Soil organic carbon stocks for the top 0.20 m were also high, reaching ca. 140 Mg ha(-1) under Araucaria, significantly higher value than the native forest (ca. 90 Mg ha(-1), p<0.05), which did not differ from the other species. Soil organic carbon stocks were not affected in the 0.20-0.40 m soil layer, whereas soil structure patterns changed under some species, without however resulting in bulk density changes, and pH decreased under Araucaria. Such data showed large SOC stocks under montane native forests can not only be preserved upon conversion to forest plantations, but considerable SOC sequestration can be achieved in 30-years rotation cycles plantations of indigenous Araucaria angustifolia, marked by more open canopies and greater understory biomass.

TI  - Butterflies of two atlantic forest conservation units from.
T2  - EntomoBrasilis
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation Units are areas legally established by the government with the goal of conserving territory and its natural resources. Given the limited knowledge about the invertebrate biodiversity in the Northern Atlantic Forest, including its legally protected areas, the present study aimed to inventory butterfly species in two Conservation Units of the Northern Atlantic Forest in Paraiba, Brazil: Engenho Gargau Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN Gargau) and Mata do Xem-xem State Park (PE Xem-xem), both located in the metropolitan region of Joao Pessoa. We conducted the collections every two months, over three consecutive days, in six expeditions from February 2013 to April 2014 in RPPN Gargau and in four expeditions from August 2014 to April 2015 in PE Xem-xem. Additionally, a two-day collecting expedition was carried out in August 2021 in RPPN Gargau. We employed two sampling methods: Van Someren-Rydon traps and entomological nets. A total of 212 species (2,841 specimens) were recorded, 158 (1,867 specimens) in RPPN Gargau and 129 (974 specimens) in PE Xem-xem. Overall, Hesperiidae was the richest family (81 spp.), followed by Nymphalidae (70), Riodinidae (22), Lycaenidae (22), Pieridae (12), and Papilionidae (4). Out of the total species, 48 are new records for Paraiba, and seven for northeast Brazil. Notably, the record of Morpho menelaus eberti Weber, 1963 in RPPN Gargau, a subspecies classified as Critically Endangered (CR), stands out. The results emphasize the need to protect the forest remnants in the region, as well as to develop management and monitoring actions for butterflies and other invertebrates.

TI  - Examining protected area effectiveness in Sumatra: importance of regulations governing unprotected lands
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies suggest that protected areas conserve forests because deforestation rates are lower inside than outside protected area boundaries. Such benefits may be overestimated when deforestation rates within protected areas are contrasted with rates in lands where forest conversion is sanctioned. Here, we reexamine protected area performance by disentangling the effects of land use regulations surrounding the 110,000 km(2) protected area network in Sumatra, Indonesia.We compared 1990-2000 deforestation rates across: (1) protected areas; (2) unprotected areas sanctioned for conversion; and (3) unprotected production areas where commercial logging is permitted but conversion is not. Deforestation rates were lower in protected areas than in conversion areas (Mean: -19.8%; 95% C.I.: -29.7-10.0%; P < 0.001), but did not differ from production areas (Mean: -3.3%; 95% C.I.: -9.6-2.6%; P = 0.273).The measured protection impact of Sumatran protected areas differs with land use regulations governing unprotected lands used for comparisons. If these regulations are not considered, protected areas will appear increasingly effective as larger unprotected forested areas are sanctioned for conversion and deforested. In the 1990s, production areas were as effective as protected areas at reducing deforestation. We discuss implications of these findings for carbon conservation.

TI  - FLORISTIC SIMILARITY IN STRETCHES OF A SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUAL FOREST OF SANTA MARIA BIODIVERSITY CORRIDOR, PARANA STATE
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The function of Biodiversity Corridors is to maintain and restore connectivity between forest fragments remains. Santa Maria Biodiversity Corridor, in PR state, aims to connect Iguacu National Park to the riparian forest of the Itaipu reservoir, through the implementation of reforestation areas between remnants of Seasonal Semidecidual Forest. This study aimed to evaluate the diversity of tree species and the floristic similarity between the areas of native secondary forests and reforested areas of different ages. There were compared the density values, diversity, evenness, and floristic composition from five study areas, and the similarity was evaluated by Jaccard and Bray-Curtis distance. In two hectares, we found 2,328 individuals of 134 species and 39 families. The floristic similarity grouped the native secondary forests, which are best preserved, and the reforested areas in different groups. The 11 exotic species found in reforested areas were not observed in the most preserved areas. So, the managament of them should be encouraged in order to protect the remaining Seasonal Semidecidual Forest.

TI  - Short-term CO2-C emissions from soil prior to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) replanting in southern Brazil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - New management strategies should be identified to increase the potential of bioenergy crops to minimize climate change. This study quantified the impact of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) harvest systems, straw and soil management on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes prior to crop replanting carried out on February 2010 in southern Brazil. The soil studied was classified as Haplustult (USDA Soil Taxonomy). Three sugarcane harvest systems were considered: burned (BH) and green harvest with straw maintained on (GH SM) or removed from (GH SR) the soil surface. Our hypothesis is that intensive tillage and the management of sugarcane crop straw could lead to higher CO2 emissions from soil. We measured CO2 emissions in no-till (NT) conditions and after conventional tillage (CT), and with or without dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications. Soil CO2 emissions were measured with a Li Cor chamber (Model Li-8100). Water content of soil and soil temperature readings were first taken 24 h after tillage, over the next 25 days after tillage with 18 measurement days. The removal of sugarcane straw from the soil surface resulted in the rapid reduction of water content of soil (6% in volume) followed by a 64% increase in soil CO2-C emissions, supporting our hypothesis. Additional soil CO2-C emissions caused by removal of crop straw were 253 kg CO2-C ha(-1), which is as high as CO2-C losses induced by tillage. Dolomite and agricultural gypsum applications did not always increase CO2 emissions, especially when applied on soil surface with crop straw and tilled. The conversion from burned to green harvest systems can improve the soil C sequestration rate in sugarcane crops when combined with reduced tillage and straw maintenance on soil surface. The effect of straw removal and related CO2 emission for electricity generation should be considered in further studies from sugarcane areas.

TI  - Principle and practice of the buffer zone in biosphere reserves: from global to local - general perspective from managers versus local perspective from villagers in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The establishment of buffer zones as part of protected areas within biosphere reserves but also national parks is central to conservation strategies designed to safeguard remaining biodiversity, mainly left in tropical forests. However, the real-world situation of protected areas reveals a range of problems. This study seeks to identify the diverse ways of thinking among relevant actors in order to address these issues.In the present work, characteristics of the global perspective of managers are contrasted with findings from a field study in the forest biosphere reserve Lore Lindu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this context, the differences between the villagers' point of view regarding the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zones and the managers' perspective on the sustainability of human uses in the same areas are highlighted. This paper follows two complementary approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative research tools when examining the respective positions of both managers and villagers.Quantitative analysis of a global survey among biosphere reserve managers revealed that human uses in the buffer zones are generally considered to be sustainable (mean value for evaluation of 6.4 on a scale from 1 to 10). Besides a significant negative correlation (-0.3) between number of residents in the buffer zone and accordance to sustainability of human uses, no meaningful relation was computed either in respect to country income or tropical forest regions.Because of this lack of conclusive data, we zoomed in on the local level and included the villagers' perspective. Factors influencing the implementation of sustainable-development activities in the buffer zone were the central issue of the field study. A completely different perception was found in Lore Lindu. The villagers expressed the opinion that basic management activities such as nonexistence of boundary demarcation and lack of law enforcement are the most crucial factors in regard to how sustainable-development activities are implemented. Further barriers are insufficient awareness of forest conservation needs among groups of villagers and the ever-increasing number of immigrants. Furthermore, the results of this study point to the high relevance of a mediator in the communication process between the management body and local people. Clearly formulated rules and laws and abidance by enforcement of the law seem to play a major role in buffer-zone management. Moreover, the different ethnic groups have to be taken into account by the park management in communication processes. Local people should be considered as partners (in buffer-zone management) rather than as passive objects in this process.

TI  - Spatial variability of tree species diversity in a mixed tropical forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants. However, these analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity, leading to develop additional tools. This study aimed to estimate the spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in a Brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area. We used indices to measure the tree species diversity (dbh >= 10 cm) in 400 sampling units (25 m x 25 m) from a continuous forest inventory. Semivariograms were fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied to compose maps. Mean diversity values were constant in the continuous inventories, indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of ecological succession. On the other hand, tree diversity presented spatial patterns identified by geostatistics, in which the dynamics were composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species with different ecological features and densities, gap dynamics, advancement of forest succession, mortality, and Araucaria angustilofia's cohorts.

TI  - Bird beta-diversity of tree plantations and natural forests immersed within a grassy landscape in southern Brazil
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of natural grasslands into tree plantations has reduced the extent of natural habitats in southern Brazil, altering bird composition due to local species extinction and colonization. Tree plantations represent a new land use in the region and are within a mosaic of altered and native vegetation. We investigated whether bird composition of tree plantations immersed within a grassy landscape consists of a nested subset of species from adjacent riparian forests. We sampled birds in riparian forests and in eucalyptus plantations at two stages of development using the point count method. We partitioned beta-diversity into nestedness and turnover components to detect the strength of local extinction and colonization processes, respectively, in determining variation in composition among native forests and intermediate and old-aged plantations considering all birds together and only forest-specialist birds. We then used linear models to test the effect of land use on the pairwise turnover and nestedness that each plantation presents relative to native forests. We recorded 72 bird species, of which 62, 25, and 22 species were found in riparian forests, intermediate, and old-aged plantations, respectively. Turnover predominated in beta-diversity partitioning-whether all birds or just forest-specialist birds were analyzed-showing that the bird composition of tree plantations might not depend on adjacent forests, but instead on sparse resource availability within tree plantations. Finally, we found lower bird turnover for plantations relative to native forests with increasing cover of tree plantations in the landscape. Large extents of tree plantations in the landscape, therefore, homogenize bird composition across sites.

TI  - Definition of priority areas for forest conservation through the ordered weighted averaging method
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The general objective of this study was to evaluate the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method, integrated to a geographic information systems (GIS), in the definition of priority areas for forest conservation in a Brazilian river basin, aiming at to increase the regional biodiversity. We demonstrated how one could obtain a range of alternatives by applying OWA, including the one obtained by the weighted linear combination method and, also the use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to structure the decision problem and to assign the importance to each criterion. The criteria considered important to this study were: proximity to forest patches; proximity among forest patches with larger core area; proximity to surface water; distance from roads: distance from urban areas; and vulnerability to erosion. OWA requires two sets of criteria weights: the weights of relative criterion importance and the order weights. Thus, Participatory Technique was used to define the criteria set and the criterion importance (based in AHP). In order to obtain the second set of weights we considered the influence of each criterion, as well as the importance of each one, on this decision-making process. The sensitivity analysis indicated coherence among the criterion importance weights, the order weights, and the solution. According to this analysis, only the proximity to surface water criterion is not important to identify priority areas for forest conservation. Finally, we can highlight that the OWA method is flexible, easy to be implemented and, mainly, it facilitates a better understanding of the alternative land-use suitability patterns.

TI  - The conversion of grassland to acacia forest as an effective option for net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of forestation with leguminous Acacia mearnsii De Wild in native grasslands on the soil greenhouse (GHG) fluxes and their main driving factors. The experiment was conducted in the Brazilian Pampa over the period of one year in a six-year-old Acacia plantation, evaluating four treatments: Acacia (AM), Acacia with litter periodically removed (A-I), Acacia after harvest (AH) and native grassland (NG) (reference treatment). Air samples were obtained by the static chamber method, and gas concentrations were evaluated by gas chromatography. Soil and climate factors were monitored. The accumulated fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were statistically similar between the soils in the AM and NG treatments, which tended to oxidize CH4 (-1445 and -1752 g C-CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) and had low emission of N2O (242 and 316 g N-N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)), most likely influenced by the low water-filled pore space and the low content of mineral N in the soil. However, the soil in the AH treatment presented higher emissions of both gases, totaling 1889 g C-CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1250 g N-N2O ha(-1) yr(-1). Afforestation neither significantly affected the total organic C stocks nor their lability, keeping the C management index for the forested area similar to that in the NG treatment. The conversion from grassland to Acacia forest represents an effective option for mitigating the net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is basically determined by C accumulation in biomass and wood products.

TI  - Relative fire-proneness of land cover types in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are increasingly affecting tropical biomes, where landscape-fire interactions remain understudied. We investigate the fire-proneness-the likelihood of a land use or land cover (LULC) type burning more or less than expected based on availability-in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF). This biodiversity hotspot is increasingly affected by fires due to human activities and climate change. Using a selection ratio-based approach, we analyzed fire-LULC interactions in 40,869 fires over a 35-year period (1987-2022) across various ecoregions in the AF. Our findings revealed that secondary forests, forest areas that have regrown after major disturbances, burned 61% more than expected by chance, whereas old-growth forests, native forests that have developed over very long periods, burned 57% less than expected, highlighting a nearly inverse relationship in their fire-proneness. Interestingly, our data indicate that pastures in the AF are less prone to fire than expected, despite being considered among the land uses that burn the most in Brazil. Other LULCs showed variable fire-proneness, with some differences between ecoregions. Over time, the fire-proneness of secondary forests decreased, likely due to forest aging and changes in land management practices. We emphasize the necessity for tailored fire management strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities of secondary forests, particularly in the context of ongoing restoration efforts aimed at increasing native forests. Effective measures, including the implementation of 'firesmart management' practices and enhancing the perceived value of secondary forests among local communities, are crucial for mitigating fire risks. Integrating these strategies with incentive-based approaches can bolster fire prevention, ensuring the long-term success of restoration programs. Our study provides a framework for understanding fire-landscape dynamics in tropical forests and offers actionable insights for practitioners working to safeguard these biomes from the escalating threat of wildfires.

AB  - Anoa is an endemic Sulawesi mammal and listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This conservation status represents the critical condition of declining population in the wild due to continuing habitat loss and poaching. This paper aims to review anoa conservation efforts both in-situ and ex-situ that have been conducted by the Government of Indonesia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private companies, and local communities in Sulawesi. A number of 16 papers were reviewed in order to gather some information regarding the conservation efforts in Sulawesi. Several protected areas were established to protect Sulawesi biodiversity, including anoa. Local communities within the park (e.g., Toro local people) contribute to this effort by having customary laws, not to hunting anoa. The government also ratified relevant policies and regulations to support anoa conservation. Anoa Breeding Center in North Sulawesi was started in 2010 to foster research and breeding program. The center has been working together with other local conservation NGOs, Nature Resources Conservation Agency, and private sectors through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs to set up anoa sanctuaries. Also, to organize outreach activities to raise social awareness of this charismatic animal Increasing the anoa population depends on the continuity of these concerted efforts and regional regulations should be created to improve anoa conservation programs.

TI  - Vertical distribution of aboveground biomass in a seasonal deciduous forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of aboveground biomass stock in Seasonal Deciduous Forests is imperative for the implementation of mechanisms to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and land reclamation. The present study analyzed the vertical distribution of aboveground biomasses in a Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Seven 12 x 12 m plots were established, and all trees inside the plots were weighed directly in the field. Subplots of 5 x 5 m and 1 x 1 m were marked within the main plots to quantify the remaining vegetation. Average dry aboveground biomass was 316.5 Mg ha-1, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm accounting for over 89% of this biomass. Therefore, biomass determination of large trees deserves special attention, since they represent a large part of the biomass of this forest ecosystem. Biomass of plants taller than 1.3 m and with diameter at breast height < 5 cm was 6.9 Mg ha-1, and that of plants lower than 1.3 m was 1.5 Mg ha-1. Average litter mass was 15.6 Mg ha-1. Trees of large diameters must be analyzed very carefully for quantify the biomass and carbon in the forests, because few individuals might represent a large part of the biomass of a forest ecosystem.

TI  - Climate-related land use policies in Brazil: How much has been achieved with economic incentives in agriculture?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Until 2019, the Brazilian federal government employed a number of policy measures to fulfill the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from land use change and agriculture. While its forest law enforcement strategy was partially successful in combating illegal deforestation, the effectiveness of positive incentive measures in agriculture has been less clear. The reason is that emissions reduction from market-based incentives such as the Brazilian Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan cannot be easily verified with current remote sensing monitoring approaches. Farmers have adopted a large variety of integrated land-use systems of crop, livestock and forestry with highly diverse per-hectare carbon balances. Their responses to policy incentives were largely driven by cost and benefit considerations at the farm level and not necessarily aligned with federal environmental objectives. This article analyzes climate-related land-use policies in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean-cotton and soybean-maize cropping systems prevail. We employ agent-based bioeconomic simulation together with life-cycle assessment to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs, benefits of adoption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis confirms previous assessments but suggests a smaller farmer policy response when measured as increase in area of integrated systems. In terms of net carbon balances, our simulation results indicate that mitigation effects at the farm level depended heavily on the exact type of livestock and grazing system. The available data were insufficient to rule out even adverse effects. The Brazilian experience thus offers lessons for other land-rich countries that build their climate mitigation policies on economic incentives in agriculture.

TI  - Climate-smart agriculture and soil C sequestration in Brazilian Cerrado: a systematic review
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, mainly no-tillage (NT), cover cropping (CC), soil fertilization with organic amendments (OA), and crop-livestock (CL) and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) systems, has been widely adopted in areas from Brazilian Cerrado. The CSA may partly offset former soil C losses and contribute to climate change mitigation. However, contradictory findings brought uncertainties about the effect of CSA on soil C. Here, by a systematic review of 87 papers and using 621 data pairs, we provided a pervasive biome-scale analysis of soil C stock changes associated with the adoption of CSA across Brazilian Cerrado. All CSA practices evaluated showed average positive rates of C stock change, indicating a general tendency of soil C accretion after its adoption. In areas under NT, CC and CLF, greater rates were estimated for the deeper soil profile evaluated (0.00-1.00 m) (1.24 +/- 0.85, 0.54 +/- 0.54 and 1.00 +/- 1.47 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively), while OA and CL showed more soil C accretion when the assessment was limited down to 0.10 m depth (0.82 +/- 0.60 and 0.59 +/- 0.66 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively). Unfortunately, the lack of basic information precluded any attempt to statically compare our estimations. In this sense, we must be cautious in stating that soil C sequestration occurs at those rates after the adoption of CSA practices. Despite these limitations, the results clearly show that the diversification and intensification of agricultural areas in the Cerrado by the adoption of CSA is a promising pathway to increase soil C stocks, and consequently, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Finally, our findings emphasize the importance of efforts that stimulate farmers to adopt these practices on large scale, such as Brazil's Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan, besides providing sound empirical evidence about the role of soil C sequestration in Brazil achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions commitments.

TI  - Aggregate C depletion by plowing and its restoration by diverse biomass-C inputs under no-till in sub-tropical and tropical regions of Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Encapsulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) within aggregates is one of the principal mechanisms for long-term C sequestration, macroaggregate formation and stabilization. Our objectives were to quantify the changes in aggregate size distribution, aggregate-C concentrations and stocks upon conversion of native vegetation (NV) to conventional plow-based tillage (CT), and to assess the rate of aggregation and SOC recovery with no-till (NT) under diverse biomass-C inputs. The study was conducted at both sub-tropical (Ponta Grossa - PG, State of Parana) and tropical (Lucas do Rio Verde - LRV, State of Mato Grosso) sites in Brazil. The SOC content under NV was used as a baseline to evaluate the depletion rate under CT and the restoration rate under NT. A specific emphasis was given to the largest macroaggregate size class (8-19 mm) because of its importance to protecting the recently deposited labile SOC. A discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) indicated that NV soil is modified by conversion to an arable land use and that, mechanical tillage, biomass input, and their interactions drastically influence the distribution of aggregate-size classes, aggregation indices, and SOC distribution within aggregates. At both sites, soil aggregation indices were positively impacted by NT and associated with SOC concentration in the labile fractions (e.g., total polysaccharides (TPS), hot water extractable organic C (HWEOC), particulate organic C (POC)). At the PG site, the 8-19 mm aggregate size fraction was significantly affected by land use and tillage treatments and represented 54%, 43%, and 72%, under NV, CT, and NT in 0-20 cm depth, respectively. Furthermore, the 8-19 mm size fraction stored 55%, 45%, and 71% of the total SOC stock under NV (53.8 Mg C ha(-1)), CT (28.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and NT (51.2 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. At the LRV site, the 8-19 mm aggregate size fraction decreased from 50% under Cerrado NV to 35% under CT, and ranged from 33% to 51% under diverse biomass-C input under NT in 0-20 cm depth. The 8-19 mm size fraction stored 52%, 37%, and 41% of the total SOC stock across all aggregate sizes under NV (25.4 Mg C ha(-1)), CT (11.7 Mg C ha(-1)), and NT (9.9-18.1 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. The difference in SOC stock among land uses is largely attributed to storage in the 8-19 mm aggregate size class, indicating that NT cropping systems rebuilt the largest macroaggregates, which are crucial for stabilization of SOC.

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - The interactions between soil invertebrates and land use and management are fundamental for soil quality assessment but remain largely unaddressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in soil arthropod community of an entisol brought about by different land use systems under semiarid climate in Pernambuco State, Brazil. The soil invertebrate community was sampled using pitfall traps from areas with eight vegetation types by the end of the austral winter. The land uses studied were native thorn forest plus seven agricultural fields planted with elephant grass, apple guava, passion fruit, carrot, maize, tomato, and green pepper. Native vegetation was considered as a reference, whereas the agricultural fields showed a range of soil use intensities. The abundance of organisms, the total and average richness, Shannon's diversity index, and the Pielou uniformity index were determined, and all of these were affected by several crop and soil management practices such as residue cover, weed control, and pesticide application. Our study found differences in community assemblages and composition under different land use systems, but no single taxa could be used as indicator of soil use intensity.

TI  - Diversity of hemipterans in Eucalyptus spp. plantations in southeastern pará, Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has 10.2 million hectares of reforestation, which account for 81% of the timber produced in the country. The order Hemiptera contains the main phytophagous species. The study of population surveys allows the analysis of faunal composition, resource availability, as well as potential pests in future plantations, contributing to sustainable pest management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of insects of the order Hemiptera in Eucalyptus spp. plantations in southeastern Par & aacute;, Eastern Amazon. Yellow adhesive traps were used to collect entomofauna, with 12 collections in total, (6) during the dry season and (6) during the rainy season. A total of 28 traps were installed in areas with clones of Eucalyptus urophylla, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urograndis, in three municipalities in Par & aacute;. The insects collected were analyzed through the faunal indices of abundance,constancy, dominance and frequency, and diversity of Shanon and Pielou. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the families that most influenced the different climatic seasons and in the different clones of Eucalyptus spp. A total of 18.320 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 families. The greatest abundance was observed in the dry season, influencing the seasonality of the families that presented the highest faunal indices. Cicadellidae presented high indices in the three clones, highlighting the clone E. urograndis with the greatest diversity of insects and richness of families, during the dry season, which demonstrates the strong preference of the families for the season and for this species, and indicates a great risk of becoming a potential pest in future commercial plantations, monitoring and preventive actions are recommended to mitigate the impact of these species.

TI  - Tourism Management in the Tapajos National Forest.
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Tapajos National Forest, located in the western region of Para, ecotourism is an activity that contributes to the generation of income and involvement of local communities in forest conservation. The network of partnerships and community participation are fundamental for the ordering of ecotourism in Conservation Units. This research aims to show the initiatives that are contributing to the management of tourism and materializing the future vision of the Tapajos National Forest. The collection of information occurred through bibliographical research and consultations in internal documents of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and interviews with local actors. The study showed that the network of partnerships was essential for the planning of tourism in the Conservation Unit. The participation of partners and communities in tourism management occurred through the Tourism Group and the Tourism Sector linked to the Consulting Council of Tapajos National Forest. The network of partnerships contributed with several management activities, including the revision of the Management Plan, the mapping of trails and the elaboration of action plans and projects. Communities indicated that there is a conflict with conventional tourism. In addition, they find it difficult to negotiate with tour operators, market their tour packages and communicate with some visitors in other languages. Ecotourism in the Tapajos National Forest has contributed to strengthening partnerships and community organizations, generating income and involving local communities in forest conservation.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis on Wildfires and Protected Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire are increasingly frequent events on a planet undergoing climate change. With more favourable climate conditions for their occurrence, like prolonged periods of drought, the frequency and intensity of these catastrophes continue to increase. Protected areas are important territories for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity around the world and serve as a key management tool in national environmental policies. Many studies have been developed around the world to assess the conditions, frequency, and intensity of fires, and, on the other hand, protected areas are intensively studied to understand whether conservation actions are effective in keeping the ecosystem balanced. However, there are few studies that contemplate these two themes together. Consequently, this study offers a bibliometric analysis of the wildfires and its occurrence in protected areas, aiming to understand the spatial and temporal relation between them, characteristics of the research studies, and trending issues to be worked on. We used the Bibliometrix package in R language, which provides the option of different methods for analysing bibliometric data to understand the temporal evolution of the published documents about wildfires and protected areas. In total, 1116 publications were analysed, ranging from 1970 to 2022. The findings show that the terms "fires" (185 occurrences), "fire" (117), "wildfire" (101), and "forest fire" (92) are more frequently used and associated with studies on topics including biodiversity (304), conservation (221), environmental protection (188), deforestation (148), ecosystems (138), forestry (133), and climate change (126) as well as protected areas (399). The highest growth of research has been registered since 2002. The majority of the publications were published by authors from universities in the USA (77), South Africa (72), the United Kingdom (22), and Brazil (19). The USA leads all other countries with 7 of the top 10 international collaborations, followed by Brazil, Australia, and South Africa. However, only the United Kingdom continues to maintain an increased number of external (inter-country) collaborations, whereas the other nine continue to maintain an increased number of internal (intra-country). Considering the top 10 authors in terms of production, only 1 was active from 1999 to 2019, and the other 9 only have been active since 2009. The topics that stand out were subjected to a coupling analysis, which revealed that environmental protection is a motor theme, endangered species, Australia, and savannah are niche themes, and protected area, biodiversity, and fire management are basic themes.

TI  - Microclimate and land surface temperature in a biodiversity enriched oil palm plantation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry options such as mixed-species tree planting and natural regeneration in oil palm plantations may alleviate negative effects of forest loss on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The effects of agroforestry on microclimate and land surface temperatures (LST) remain largely unknown despite their central role in controlling abiotic and biotic factors and in buffering climate at a larger scale. We assessed spatial and temporal microclimate and LST variability in a biodiversity enrichment experiment, in which tree islands have been planted in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). Four years after establishment of the experiment, we measured microclimate and LST using mini microclimate sensors and drone-recorded thermal images. We examined experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and LST. Diurnal patterns showed ambient air temperature peaks and relative humidity (RH) minima at 3 pm, whereas diurnal soil temperatures peaked around 6 pm. The lowest LST were observed from oil palm canopy leaves and the highest from bare soils and understorey vegetation (including trees). Spatial and temporal ranges of ambient air temperature were smaller than LST ranges, and average ambient air temperature and LST were positively correlated. Tree species diversity had no overall significant effect neither on microclimate nor LST, but humidity was higher in planted tree islands compared to natural regeneration only. Smaller plots were characterized by higher mean air, soil and LST, compared to larger plots. Structurally complex plots were associated with low mean and maximum values of ambient air temperature, soil temperature and LST and high mean and minimum RH. Still, conditions were hotter and drier in several experimental plots compared to conventional oil palm plantations, considering a higher transpiration in the latest. We conclude that stand structural complexity and tree island size control microclimate and LST in the experimental oil palm agroforests, but alleviating the harsh microclimate conditions in oil palm plantations might take longer to occur.

TI  - Market-mediated responses confound policies to limit deforestation from oil palm expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The global demand for palm oil has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs.

TI  - Legume cover crops under no-tillage favor organomineral association in microaggregates and soil C accumulation
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Both no-tillage and legume cover crops have been shown to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in subtropical soils. However, the mechanisms underpinning management system effects on SOC accumulation are still not well understood. We used a combination of aggregate size and density fractionation to elucidate these mechanisms at a 30-year old experiment on an Acrisol in southern Brazil. The effects of two tillage systems [conventional system (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] combined with three cropping systems [oat/maize (O/M), vetch/maize (V/M) and oat + vetch/maize + cowpea (OV/MC)] were evaluated in the top 20 cm soil layer. Overall, macro-aggregation (> 0.25 mm) was significantly influenced by tillage with NT showing values 14% greater than CT in the 0-5 cm soil depth. On average, the occluded light fraction-C content in macroaggregates was more than twice as high under NT compared to CT (4.4 vs. 1.8 g kg(-1)). This effect was more pronounced when legume cover crops were grown. However, the most significant effect of cover crops was observed in the organomineral fraction of microaggregates, especially under NT (12.1 under O/M and 19.8 g kg(-1) under OV/MC). Our results suggest that, although NT increased the occluded light fraction-C compared to CT, this effect was smaller than the gains that legume cover crops offered in organomineral association.

TI  - The responses of leaf litter ant communities to wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon: a multi-region assessment
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is frequently used as tool for land management in the Amazon, but often escapes into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We investigated the effects of single wildfires on ant communities in four geographically distinct regions of the Brazilian Amazon (Roraima, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) where forests had burned between 8 months and 10 years before our sampling. We established 7-12 transects, 500 m each, in burned and unburned forests in each region to investigate the effects of fire on forest structure and leaf litter ant communities, which were sampled using Winkler sacks. Fire effects on forest structure were more drastic in the most recently burned forests in Acre and Mato Grosso, while the impacts of older burns in Roraima and Para were more subtle. Ant species richness was not different between burnt and unburned areas, but community composition differed between burned and control forests in all regions except Mato Grosso. At the species level, indicator species analysis showed that a limited number of species were significant indicators of unburned control forests in all regions, except Acre. Forests structure variables and leaf litter volume were all important in shaping ant communities, but their relative importance varied between regions. Our results indicate that burned forest have different ant species communities from unburned forests, and those differences are still apparent 10 years after the disturbance, highlighting the importance of effective policies for fire management in Amazon.

TI  - Monitoring soil quality changes in diversified agricultural cropping systems by the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) in southern Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment and monitoring impacts of agricultural systems on soil quality are imperative to establish best management practices and sustainable land use for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity and achieving food and energy security. The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Parana, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil.

T2  - SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS, VOL VI: ASIA/PACIFIC
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Studies on biogeography are useful to understand the present and past distribution patterns of biological diversity and their underlying environmental and historical causes. The mangrove realm, largely confined to sheltered tropical and subtropical coastlines within latitudes of around 32 degrees N and 38 degrees S, is divided longitudinally into an Atlantic realm and an Indo-Pacific realm. Because of the relatively recent closure of the Central American Isthmus, a small incursion of the Atlantic realm species has occurred into the Indo-Pacific realm along the tropical and subtropical American Pacific coast and spread north and south since the last glaciation. Although the biogeography of mangroves has been widely discussed, recent investigations of mangrove floristics and genetic diversity using molecular studies warrant a further comprehensive account of the biogeography of mangroves. Considering these facts, the biogeography of the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) mangroves has been examined in detail, and the Atlantic East Pacific mangrove region (AEP) has only been briefly discussed. The difference in species richness between the IWP and the AEP is evidence of the effectiveness of the African land mass and the East Pacific Ocean barriers. Within the IWP, two trends in relation to mangrove species richness can be identified: first, maximal species richness which occurs along the shorelines of Makassar Strait, between Borneo and Sulawesi in Indonesia, and second, the marked attenuation of species numbers with increasing latitude generally related to limiting temperatures. The contemporary and historical processes leading to these trends are summarized and discussed. Finally, the threats to the mangroves of the various regions within the IWP are subsequently briefly reviewed, and given the ecological and economic values of mangroves, the potential of mangrove restoration/rehabilitation to offset mangrove losses is also evaluated.

TI  - Mainstreaming Smart Agroforestry for Social Forestry Implementation to Support Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing need for forest resources and cultivated land requires a solution in forest management to realize sustainable land use. Smart agroforestry (SAF) is a set of agriculture and silviculture knowledge and practices that is aimed at not only increasing profits and resilience for farmers but also improving environmental parameters, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity enhancement, and soil and water conservation, while assuring sustainable landscape management. SAF, a solution for land management systems to reduce the rate of deforestation, is a smart effort to overcome the food crisis and mitigate climate change that is prospectively applied mainly in the social forestry area. Optimized forest land utilization could be achieved by implementing SAF and applying silvicultural and crop cultivation techniques to optimize productivity and meet sustainability and adaptability goals. This paper reviews the existing conditions, opportunities, and challenges in the mainstreaming of SAF in social forestry implementation to support the Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia. Mainstreaming SAF should include policy innovation and regulation implementation, the use of appropriate technology, and compromises or trade-offs among benefits, risks, and resources. SAF is a strategy to revive the rural economy and community prosperity through the optimal use of local resources as well as a form of smart landscape and land-use management that has significant roles in soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change responses, and enhanced biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Torem (Manilkara kanosiensis) is a timber tree species endemic to Yamdena Island in Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago in Papua New Guinea. Due to its high-quality timber, the trees are harvested from its natural populations. These logging activities have put the species into the endangered category according to IUCN Red List since more than 20 years ago. In the present study, the population assessment of Torem will be conducted in the customary forest of Lorulun, Yamdena Island, Indonesia. Distance sampling using line -transect was used to assess the distribution of Torem, identify population size and structure, estimate population density, and update the conservation status of the species. The results showed Torem trees were mostly located at relatively flat areas (4.5 +/- 0.2 degrees), with the elevation range of 81-134 m above sea level. A total of 228 individuals of Torem was located during the survey, with more than half of them (56.68%) were within 0-10 cm dbh class. The density estimate of the species was 14.8 +/- 4.4 individuals/ha. The assessment of conservation status against IUCN Red List Category and Criteria revealed that Torem was qualified for the status of Endangered A2cd, B2ab (i, ii, iv, v), C2a(i), D.

TI  - Natural history collections reveal species richness on a small isolated tropical island: the bats of Siberut
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - The paucity of biodiversity assessments in the Palaeotropics has constrained recommendations for tropical forest conservation in areas such as Siberut, one of the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia known for its high endemicity. Taking advantage of information from museum collections amassed from the Indo-Malaya archipelago from the early 20th century onwards, we show how species records available through online databases of natural history collections can be used to assess the state of biodiversity when used in conjunction with a field survey, using bat species on Siberut as a study case. We obtained a total of 15 years of records from 1903 to 2013 (following searches of databases up to 2020), documenting 20 bat species on Siberut. Of these, our field survey contributed records of three additional species not previously recorded on the island. The species accumulation curve has not levelled off, suggesting that future surveys may discover additional bat species and highlighting Siberut's importance as bat habitat and source of tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado: A review
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews current knowledge on changes in carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado. First, we briefly characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use, particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems, and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP), reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, N2O and CH4) to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies should include the application of an integrated modelling system, comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined changes in soil use and management.

TI  - Stratification ratio of soil organic matter pools as an indicator of carbon sequestration in a tillage chronosequence on a Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term no-tillage (NT) leads to profile stratification of soil organic matter (SOM) pools, and the soil organic carbon (SOC) stratification ratio (SR) is an indicator of soil quality. The objective of this report is to assess the feasibility of using SOC-SR as an index for estimating SOC sequestration in NT soils. The effect of a plow tillage (PT) and NT chronosequence on the SR of SOM pools was assessed in an Oxisol in Southern Brazil (50 degrees 23'W and 24 degrees 36'S). The chronosequence consisted of six sites: (i) native field (NF); (ii) PT of the native field (PNF-1) involving conversion of natural vegetation to cropland; (iii) NT for 10 years (NT-10); (iv) NT for 20 years (NT-20); (v) NT for 22 years (NT-22); (vi) conventional tillage for 22 years (CT-22). Soil samples were collected from four depths (0-5 cm; 5-10 cm; 10-20 cm; 20-40 cm layer) and soil parameters comprised by SOM pools [i.e., C, N, S, particulate organic C (POC). particulate N (PN), stable C (SC) and stable N (SN), microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN). basal respiration (BR), dissolved organic C (DOC), total polysaccharides (TP) and labile polysaccharides (LP)] were measured. In undisturbed NF soil, the SR of all parameters increased with increase in soil depth. In contrast, the SIR decreased in PT, and the SOM was uniformly distributed in the soil profile. All NT treatments restored the SR, and were characterized with higher values of all measured parameters compared to NF. The SIR for SOC ranged from 1.12 to 1.51 for CT-22 compared with 1.64-2.61 SR for NT surface and sub-soil layers, respectively. The SR for POC and PN were higher than those for stable C and N. However, SR for the biological pools (e.g., MBC, MBN and BR) were the highest and strongly correlated with the rate of SOC sequestration. An increase in SR of SOC was also positively correlated with the rate and amount of SOC sequestered. Regression analyses indicated a strong correlation between SIR of SOC and all parameters monitored in this study. The data showed that the SR of SOC is an efficient indicator of C sequestration in long-term NT management. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of pasture-burning management on anuran communities in subtropical Brazilian grasslands.
T2  - Biotropica
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic fire is a worldwide event that affects many ecosystems and organisms. In Southern Brazil, grassland management with fire has been highly employed since the mid-18th century. Although the practice is regulated by federal law (prescribed fire), there is no detailed information about the impacts of this practice on the small, non-volant fauna. We evaluated the effect of fire management on anuran species richness and community composition in Brazilian grassland areas that have adopted this practice for more than 15 years. Our results show that burning practices lead to a reduction of anuran richness. About 37% of the species occur exclusively in sites free of fire. Sites with fire management have low densities of taller grass and shrubs, which could reduce habitat availability for some anuran species. Nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity did not differ within and between treatments, but there was a tendency for a nestedness organization of the community in burned sites, suggesting that sites with fire management are a subsample of sites where fire is absent. Our results pointed out that prescribed fire practices have potentially negative effects on the anuran diversity. These results suggest that the changes in vegetation, in particular percentages of shrub cover, affect habitat suitability for some species. Therefore, anuran communities tend to become less diverse and lack arboreal species where fire occurs.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material. O fogo antropogenico e um evento mundial que afeta muitos ecossistemas e organismos. No Sul do Brasil, o manejo de pastagens com fogo tem sido muito empregado desde meados do seculo XVIII. Embora a pratica seja regulamentada por lei federal (fogo prescrito), nao ha informacoes detalhadas sobre os impactos dessa pratica sobre a pequena fauna nao-voadora. Nos avaliamos o efeito do manejo do fogo na riqueza de especies de anuros e na composicao da comunidade em areas campestres brasileiras que adotam essa pratica ha mais de 15 anos. Nossos resultados mostram que as praticas de queimadas levam a reducao da riqueza de anuros. Cerca de 37% das especies ocorrem exclusivamente em locais livres de fogo. Os locais com manejo do fogo apresentam baixas densidades de gramineas e arbustos mais altos, o que poderia reduzir a disponibilidade de habitat para algumas especies de anuros. Os componentes de aninhamento e rotatividade da diversidade beta nao diferiram entre os tratamentos, mas houve uma tendencia para uma organizacao aninhada da comunidade em locais queimados, sugerindo que locais com manejo de fogo sao uma subamostra de locais onde o fogo esta ausente. Nossos resultados apontaram que praticas prescritas de fogo tem efeitos potencialmente negativos sobre a diversidade de anuros. Estes resultados sugerem que as alteracoes na vegetacao, em particular as percentagens de cobertura arbustiva, afetam a adequacao do habitat para algumas especies.

TI  - Modelling the potential for soil carbon sequestration using biochar from sugarcane residues in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivation leaves behind around 20 t ha(-1) of biomass residue after harvest and processing. We investigated the potential for sequestering carbon (C) in soil with these residues by partially converting them into biochar (recalcitrant carbon-rich material). First, we modified the RothC model to allow changes in soil C arising from additions of sugarcane-derived biochar. Second, we evaluated the modified model against published field data, and found satisfactory agreement between observed and predicted soil C accumulation. Third, we used the model to explore the potential for soil C sequestration with sugarcane biochar in SAo Paulo State, Brazil. The results show a potential increase in soil C stocks by 2.35 +/- 0.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1) in sugarcane fields across the State at application rates of 4.2 t biochar ha(-1) year(-1). Scaling to the total sugarcane area of the State, this would be 50 Mt of CO2 equivalent year(-1), which is 31% of the CO2 equivalent emissions attributed to the State in 2016. Future research should (a) further validate the model with field experiments; (b) make a full life cycle assessment of the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation, including additional effects of biochar applications on greenhouse gas balances.

TI  - N2O and CH4 emissions from soils under conventional and no-till management practices in Goiania (Cerrados, Brazil)
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases (GHG) produced respectively by the naturally occurring microbial processes of incomplete denitrification or nitrification and methanogenesis. Tillage practices and climate affect the release of GHGs. No tillage (DMC) systems may increase CO2-C fixation in soil but also N2O and CH4 emissions. The aim of this article is to question whether the positive effect of a DMC system observed on carbon storage for the topsoil layer in Cerrado soils is offset or not by the N2O and/or CH4 emissions. Two 5-year-old systems, tillage (disc on the first 15 cm called offset: OFF) and a direct-sowing mulch-based crop system (DMC) with an additional cover crop were studied during a cropping cycle. N2O and CH4 fluxes are determined using a closed-chamber, N2O and CO2 concentrations are measured at 3 depths (10-, 20- and 30 cm). No significant difference between treatments was observed for both gases (for emissions and concentrations). Soil NO contents increase from surface to depth (30 cm) and range from 300 ppbv to 3 ppm for both treatments. Total annual estimated emissions of N2O range from 31 to 35 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC and OFF respectively which is low and corresponds only to 0.03% of he total N-fertilizer applied. Monthly means N2O emissions were strongly correlated to monthly means of N2O content at 10 cm depth (R-2 = -0.66) and seem to increase exponentially with monthly mean Water Filled Pore Space WFPS (0-10 cm layer) (R-2 = 0.33). CH4 fluxes were very low as well: both treatment act as source of CH4 (245 and 403 g CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC and OFF respectively. On a CO-C equivalent basis these results correspond to 4.1 and 4.7 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for NO and to 1.9 and 3.1 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for CH4 for DMC and OFF respectively. As a result, the carbon sequestration balance taking into account the CO2, CH4 and N2O on a CO2-C equivalent basis is in favour of DMC treatment considering that this treatment increases carbon storage originated from CO-C for the topsoil (0-10 cm) layer (350 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in comparison with OFF treatment.

TI  - Evaluation of land use and forest resources in the semiarid of Paraiba state
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of soil and forest resources of the Caatinga biome in the state of Paraibawas evaluated from 1996 to 2018. Data on vegetation cover and forest resource characteristics and their productive potential for firewood and charcoal were collected.The information used to characterize Paraiba's land use and forest resources were examined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the Ministry of Environment of Brazilian (MMA) and the Northeast Plants Association (APNE). The research is exploratory and based on secondary data and may contribute, in part, to the economic development in the state. The results point to the existence of a constant degradation of the vegetation cover, although the types of soil use have changed over the studied years. The estimates adopted for vegetation cover and land use in Paraiba showed sensitivity and a high degree of risk to desertification of the biome, requiring permanent joint actions that guarantee the sustainable use of its biodiversity. It is concluded that the effective solution conies from the awareness and the practice of the Sustainable Forest Management Plan in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, providing more effectively the sustainability of the Caatinga biome.

TI  - Moving beyond commitments: creating durable change through the implementation of Asia Pulp and Paper's forest conservation policy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Campaigns by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) pressuring companies to adopt sustainability standards have caught academic interest in recent years. Critics of this approach toward increasing biodiversity protection and social justice argue that campaign successes are often short-lived while proponents emphasize the potential of NGO campaigns to achieve positive environmental and social change in the absence of governmental legislation. Focusing on the recent forest conservation policy of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a leading pulp and paper company operating in Southeast Asia, we analyze the challenges companies face in implementing sustainability commitments made as a result of NGO and market pressure. Drawing from research on policy implementation and corporate greening we identify key activities to help entrench APP's commitments in the company's operations. Furthermore, we suggest that a range of actions by different stakeholder groups can achieve broader effects of APP's commitments toward better environmental and social stewardship in the region's pulp and paper sector.

TI  - The effectiveness of acoustic indices for forest monitoring in Atlantic rainforest fragments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas, which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. Birds are widely used for this purpose, and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices, it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes. However, previous studies yield controversial results. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional point-counts survey for forest monitoring in an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection. There was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index, from the six acoustic indices evaluated. We also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the point-count survey caused bias in acoustic indices. Therefore, more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the Atlantic tropical rainforest.

TI  - Changes in physical and hydraulic properties in sandy soils of the Pampa Biome under different uses
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The naturally fragile sandy soils of the Pampa Biome (PB) may be degraded with the introduction of poorly managed agricultural crops. Anthropic use can markedly decrease vegetation cover on sandy soils, leaving them more exposed to erosive agents. Decreases in organic matter content, biodiversity, and nutrient availability, increased soil compaction, and decreased water availability are also some of the impacts caused on PB soils by implementing poorly managed agricultural crops. In Rio Grande do Sul, in areas with sandier soils, the intense replacement of PB with commercial crops that has occurred in recent years (2000-2020) may be starting a disastrous cycle of degradation of these soils. However, it is not yet known how much these soils are degraded by recent anthropic use. There are no local scientific publications dedicated to the diagnosis of the degradation of these soils by anthropic use. Therefore, the need for this study was based on the objective of evaluating the physical and hydraulic properties of sandy PB soils with the insertion of agricultural crops. The study was conducted on three different soils, where soil samples were collected under three systems of use (extensive cattle raising on native grassland, eucalyptus afforestation, and soybean crop). Our results show that it can take more than nine years for soybean and ten years for eucalyptus land-use change to indicate some level of degradation in soil physical and hydraulic properties after replacing PB with these cultivated crops.

TI  - Oil Palm Plantations, Forest Conservation and Indigenous Peoples in West Papua Province: What Lies Ahead?
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations are currently expanding to the eastern part of Indonesia, especially into West Papua province. Many oil palm permits issued in West Papua occupy intact biodiversity-rich forest areas which have essential value for indigenous Papuans' socio-cultural life. This article discusses expansion of oil palm plantations in West Papua province, and its impacts on forests and indigenous people. It also assesses whether the plantations fit the Special Autonomy Law and Sustainable Development Regulation goals of the province. In general, plantations are being established in forest areas, and further planned expansion threatens intact and biodiversity-rich forests. In addition, plantation development rarely considers the sociocultural issues of indigenous Papuans. As a result, customary rights and institutions are commonly overlooked, undermined, or violated. Oil palm plantations are not necessarily compatible with sustainable development goals, and need to reconcile its overall economic and conservation agenda.

TI  - The problem of conserving an ecosystem that has not been completely delineated and mapped: the case of the Cocais Palm Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes threaten biodiversity and alter the geographic distribution of forests worldwide. Studies on this topic are important to establish conservation strategies and public policies. However, different studies may propose different spatial representations due to differences when identifying, classifying, and/or mapping the same vegetation formation, as observed for the Cocais Forest region. This palm-dominated ecosystem predominates the Brazilian mid-north region in an ecotone region with 3 of the 6 Brazilian biomes. In this study, we conducted a literature review of studies that delineated and mapped the Cocais Forest, aiming to compare different mapped regions and to establish a new distribution map integrating these spatial data. We found seven sources that revealed spatial divergences in identifying the spatial distribution of Cocais Forest, including its characteristics in terms of size and shape, which could affect the conservation, socioeconomic, and cultural policies and studies carried out on this emblematic vegetation formation and influence area. The delineation proposed by de Sousa Nascimento and Lima (Revista de Politicas Publicas 189-192, 2016) encompassed the largest area. In addition, there was a lack of consensus regarding the nomenclature for this ecosystem, and few works offered a detailed description of the mapping process. Despite the different spatial distributions found for the Cocais Forest, we succeeded in establishing a common area by overlapping individual maps, resulting in the identification of a core region exclusive located in the State of Maranhao.

TI  - Vertical stratification of insect abundance and species richness in an Amazonian tropical forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are among the most biodiverse biomes on the planet. Nevertheless, quantifying the abundance and species richness within megadiverse groups is a significant challenge. We designed a study to address this challenge by documenting the variability of the insect fauna across a vertical canopy gradient in a Central Amazonian tropical forest. Insects were sampled over two weeks using 6-m Gressitt-style Malaise traps set at five heights (0 m-32 m-8 m intervals) on a metal tower in a tropical forest north of Manaus, Brazil. The traps contained 37,778 specimens of 18 orders of insects. Using simulation approaches and nonparametric analyses, we interpreted the abundance and richness of insects along this gradient. Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera had their greatest abundance at the ground level, whereas Lepidoptera and Hemiptera were more abundant in the upper levels of the canopy. We identified species of 38 of the 56 families of Diptera, finding that 527 out of 856 species (61.6%) were not sampled at the ground level. Mycetophilidae, Tipulidae, and Phoridae were significantly more diverse and/or abundant at the ground level, while Tachinidae, Dolichopodidae, and Lauxaniidae were more diverse or abundant at upper levels. Our study suggests the need for a careful discussion of strategies of tropical forest conservation based on a much more complete understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of its insect diversity.

TI  - Carbon storage and physical and chemical properties of a medium-textured soil in agricultural systems in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties and carbon storage in different agricultural production systems in medium-texture soils in the subtropical region of Brazil. Soil samples were collected in three management systems: Pasture (PP), no-till (NT), and no-till + Urochloa (NT+U), in addition to a native forest area (NF), in four soil layers up to 0.40 m. Chemical and physical soil analyses were performed. Bulk density and penetration resistance results did not indicate soil compaction in the areas managed after 24 years. The PP area had higher total porosity and microporosity values than the NT and NT+U areas. The PP area had the highest values of the sum of bases and CEC. NT+U and PP areas had the highest TOC contents and carbon storage potential up to the 0-0.40 m layer. The PP area in the 0-0.40 m profile had 52.89%, 72.21%, 79.79%, and 97.08% Mg ha(-1) more stocks than the NF area in the four soil layers evaluated. In the 0.20-0.40 m stratum, the NT+U area had StockC values of 11.21 Mg ha(-1), which was 17.62% more than the NT area. These results show the potential of grasslands for carbon storage in medium-texture soils under subtropical climates, mainly due to the characteristics of grasslands that can produce significant amounts of biomass constantly deposited in the soil.

In this study, we investigated the role of fire regimes on spaces used by medium and large mammals at multiple spatial scales (0.8 ha to 78.5 ha) in a fire-prone savanna ecosystem (Brazilian Cerrado). We sampled mammals using 60 camera traps distributed in 30 sampling units located in grassland and typical savanna formations. We applied single-species occupancy models and AIC-based model selection to assess how mammals use the space in response to pyrodiversity (both diversity of fire frequencies and diversity of fire ages), the proportion of recently burned area, and the proportion of long-unburned area while accounting for detectability. Our results showed that fire regime variables affected the study species differently. Deer species used the space regardless of mosaic pyrodiversity and the proportion of specific fire ages. Fire-related variables, however, affected space use by tapirs and maned wolves. Tapirs preferred to use fire mosaics with lower diversity of fire frequencies, whereas maned wolves more intensively used mosaics with high fire age diversity and a high proportion of recently burned areas. Based on our findings, we recommend that fire management targeting specific mammal species should not necessarily focus on maximum pyrodiversity. Instead, we suggest a management strategy combining "patch mosaic burning" with the maintenance of specific fire-age patches suitable for different species' requirements.

TI  - Spore density and root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in preserved or disturbed Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze. ecosystems
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze., a native forest tree from Brazil, is under extinction risk. This tree depends on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for growth and development, especially in tropical low-P soils but, despite being a conifer, Araucaria does not form ectomycorrhiza, but only the arbuscular endomycorrhiza. This study aimed at surveying data on the spore density and root colonization (CR) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in Araucaria angustifolia forest ecosystems, in order to discriminate natural, implemented, and anthropic action-impacted ecosystems, by means of Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA). Three ecosystems representative of the Campos do Jordao (SP, Brazil) region were selected: 1. a native forest (FN); 2. a replanted Araucaria forest (R); and 3. a replanted Araucaria forest, submitted to accidental fire (RF). Rhizosphere soil and roots were sampled in May and October, 2002, for root colonization, AMF identification, and spores counts. Root percent colonization rates at first collection date were relatively low and did not differ amongst ecosystems. At the second period, FN presented higher colonization than the other two areas, with much higher figures than during the first period, for all areas. Spore density was lower in FN than in the other areas. A total of 26 AMF species were identified. The percent root colonization and spore numbers were inversely related to each other in all ecosystems. CDA indicated that there is spatial distinction among the three ecosystems in regard to the evaluated parameters.

TI  - Long-term effect of selective logging on floristic composition: A 25 year experiment in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is one of the most prominent land uses in tropical forests and although it involves harvesting a limited number of trees, the impact on forest structure, composition and aboveground biomass can be significant. Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after similar to 13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans.

TI  - Fire ash residues do not affect ecological functions of Phanaeus palaeno in Cerrado grassland
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a major force acting on the structure and dynamics of the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Post-fire conditions can be severe for soil-dwelling organisms, such as dung beetles, which play essential roles in the Cerrado ecosystem. This study evaluated whether ash residues affect the ecological functions of dung burial and soil bioturbation by the Cerrado-native beetle Phanaeus palaeno Blanchard (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Phanaeini), and how its sex and weight influence the performance of ecological functions under post-fire conditions. The beetles were collected from open natural grasslands and pastures in the Cerrado biome, and the functions performed by the individuals were evaluated in the laboratory. The response of beetles was measured by quantifying the amount of buried dung and soil by both females and males in buckets filled with soil, half covered or fully covered with ash, or in buckets without ash. The amount of buried dung or bioturbated soil did not differ among treatments, demonstrating that ash does not influence P. palaeno in performing these functions. Females bioturbated more soil and buried more dung than males, but neither were affected by ash. As dung beetles perform essential ecosystem functions, this information may be helpful in developing novel fire management practices to conserve Cerrado biodiversity.

TI  - Distribution and Quality of the Organic Matter in Light and Heavy Fractions of a Red Latosol under Different Uses and Management Practices
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in distribution and quality of organic matter in light and heavy fractions of a medium-texture Red Latosol under different uses and management practices in Capinopolis, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from different layers in the profile (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm). The following treatments were evaluated: NTs, no till (no tillage) for 4 years with maize (silage) / soybean in succession; NTg, no till for 4 years with maize/maize/maize/soybean in succession; NTtf, no till for 3 years with tifton (hay) and soybeans in the last year; CS, about 30 years with conventional cultivation system (maize/soybean) with only soybean in the past 4 years; and NF, native forest. The heavy fraction contributed 75-98% of total carbon and 94-99% of total nitrogen, indicating that most carbon and nitrogen in the soil are associated with the mineral fraction, which is fundamental for the maintenance of their stocks. Tifton grass in no tillage was efficient in increasing the amounts of light fraction (free and occluded). Increases of occluded light fraction in no-till systems were greater than in conventional cultivation system. The light fraction was shown to be sensitive to soil cultivation and can be considered indicative of soil degradation. Light-fraction analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) allowed the study of changes in the chemical structure of these fractions under different uses and management practices. Occluded light fraction was shown to be more recalcitrant and condensed than the free light fraction. The surface layer in the conventional cultivation system has a more aromatic and condensed free light fraction than in no-tillage system. In general, the upper layers were less aromatic than the deepest ones.

TI  - Conservation of Forest Remnants in Brazil: Considerations on the Main Instruments for Environmental Management
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity loss is a problem that affects several natural ecosystems in the world, occurring in alarming and crescent rates. The reduction of these rates consists in the main commitment agreed among countries that participate in the Biological Diversity Convention. This article aims at examining some of the existing legal and economic instruments in Brazil to achieve this commitment, specially regarding the conservation of forest remnants. The main command and control instruments employed and established through the Brazilian Forest Code (1934; 1965; 2012a) and the National System of Conservation Areas (2000), among other regulatory devices, are presented. Some economic instruments also considered are the Ecological Goods and Services Tax and the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage. These instruments are analyzed in light of their efficacy in maintaining the forest cover in public and private areas. Their limitations and potentialities are discussed while the predominance of command and control instruments over the economic ones is observed. Finally, it is concluded that the needed improvement of the governmental strategy towards the conservation of forest remnants could be achieved by strengthening the performance of the available command and control instruments, complementing those with new economic instruments.

TI  - Advocacy coalitions and protected areas creation process: Case study in the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are the cornerstones of conservation policies worldwide. However, only few researches are led to analyse the way they emerge, except for criticising top-down governmental choices. Yet, the historical approach and strategic analysis of public policy building over the long term allows a better understanding of the stakes of action capacity of these policies. We therefore mobilize the advocacy coalition framework to show that protected areas creation is always due to coalitions of actors who belong to different professional fields and act at different scales but nevertheless share common stakes. On the basis of a comparative study in French and Brazilian Amazon, we show that if all coalitions for protected areas share a common objective of limited deforestation, they are still very different according to the type of conservation they promote (strict biodiversity conservation, population-based conservation or sustainable forest management). We also show that the ability of the coalitions to build efficient public policies is highly depending on internal factors (i.e. their ability to gather strategic resources) and on external factors (i.e. socio-political context and international pressure). Finally, the comparative analysis of coalitions pleading for the same type of protected areas in two different countries allows us to insist on the importance of qualitative embedded researches when it comes to understand why some protected areas have more chances to reach environmental effectiveness in one socio-political context than in another one.

TI  - Short-term effects of fire on small rodents in the Brazilian Cerrado and their relation with feeding habits
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the short-term (up to 60 days) fire effects on small rodents and their relation to feeding habitats in the fire-prone Cerrado of central Brazil, the most species-rich savanna in the world. We conducted prescribed-fire experiments with pre- and post-fire simultaneous sampling in burned and unburned areas to investigate the hypothesis that the effects of fire on the abundance of small rodents is related to changes in food availability and consequently the feeding habits of the animals. The findings revealed a higher availability of invertebrates in just-burned areas compared with plant resources. Stomach analyses indicated that invertebrate consumption increased after fire for the four most common rodents, but Calomys tener and especially Calomys expulsus, consumed more invertebrates in the burned areas than Necromys lasiurus or Cerradomys scotti. These Calomys rodents were also the post-fire dominant species. Thus, even within the group of rodents that are generalist feeders, distinctive short-term responses to fire were associated with changes in resource availability and with resultant differences in the abundance of plant matter and invertebrates in the rodent diets.

TI  - Meteorological and biophysical controls of evapotranspiration in tropical grazed pasture under rainfed conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main driver of the energy balance partitioning and influences hydrological and carbon cycles at global, regional and local scales. Furthermore, it is the main requirement for developing strategies to improve water use in agriculture. It is known that there is a close relationship between ET and rainfall, especially in tropical environments. Thus, the main goal of this article was to evaluate how ET and its controls (surface conductance - Gs; decoupling coefficient - Omega; Priestley-Taylor parameter - alpha) respond to the seasonal variability of meteorological forcing in tropical grazed pastures under the climatic conditions of Northeast Brazil. ET was measured using an Eddy covariance (EC) system and analyzed based on data from two agricultural years (2015-2016 and 2016-2017) with negative (-59 mm) and positive (356 mm) rainfall anomaly, respectively. ET exhibited pronounced seasonality, closely aligned with the seasonality of rainfall. Lower daily averages were observed during the dry season in both agricultural years (1.01 +/- 0.60 and 0.89 +/- 0.44 mm, respectively). On the other hand, higher daily averages were observed during the rainy season (2.44 +/- 0.75 and 4.83 +/- 0.96 mm, respectively). The Gs patterns and the significant correlation between Gs, Omega, and alpha (p < 0.01) indicate that surface control prevails over atmospheric control on an annual scale. This finding is confirmed by the annual mean values of Omega (0.27, 2015-2016) and alpha (0.38, 2016-2017). This relationship is likely induced by a vegetative stomatal control mechanism, which protects the vegetation against excessive water loss during periods of high temperatures and low humidity levels. These findings are crucial for understanding how droughts modulate components of the energy balance and water fluxes in pastures, especially given the intensification of these events. This has implications for the implementation of climate change mitigation policies and soil management.

TI  - The importance of restoration areas to conserve bird species in a highly fragmented Atlantic forest landscape
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we tested the potential of restored areas to maintain biodiversity in the scope of a recently proposed category of protected area called "Restoration Reserves". To accomplish this, we compared bird richness and functional group structure of two small forest fragments (<250 ha) with adjacent recently reforested areas (9 and 7 years of reforestation). Reforested areas had equal or higher bird richness and similar functional group structure. These results indicate that reforested areas are capable of maintaining current levels of biodiversity and reducing species extinction debt in small forest fragments, which is the main purpose of "Restoration Reserves". However, when we compared a large forest fragment with an old adjacent reforested area (20 years of reforestation), we found that it was of limited value for certain functional groups. Therefore, "Restoration Reserves" could provide essential additional habitat in highly fragmented landscapes that consists mainly of small forest fragments.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks in sugarcane cultivation: An evidence synthesis associated with land use and management practices
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biofuels are essential to ensure the energy transition and mitigating of climate change. However, understanding the impact of land use change (LUC) and management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is fundamental to ensuring well-founded policymaking and assessing the sector's carbon footprint. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis (511 pairwise observations) to obtain Brazil's SOC stock change factors (SOCscf) for LUC and management practices in sugarcane fields. Our results showed that converting native vegetation to sugarcane reduced the SOC stock in all assessed periods. The conversion from annual crops to sugarcane showed a reduction in SOC stock in the first 10 years but with a recovery over time. The conversion of pasture to sugarcane reduced the SOC stock only in the 10-20-year period and had a neutral effect in other periods evaluated. However, our dataset showed high variability in SOCscf, with many observations indicating an increase in SOC stock, which is related to degraded pastures. We observed that the SOC accumulation rate for each ton of sugarcane straw was affected by the interaction between soil texture and precipitation. Regarding straw management, a low removal rate (< 34%) did not affect the SOC stock, while moderate (34%-66%) and high (> 66%) removal resulted in losses of 5.0% (SOCscf 0.950) and 9.9% (SOCscf 0.901), respectively. Our results also showed that reduced tillage and vinasse application increased SOC stocks by 24.0% (SOCscf 1.24) and 10.0% (SOCscf 1.10) respectively, proving to be good strategies to support C sequestration in sugarcane fields. Finally, we highlight that our results can contribute to the improvement of public policies and also be used in future life cycle assessment (LCA) and modeling studies, as they provide robust data to establishing regional SOCscf induced by LUC and management practices, enhancing the reliability of the C footprint assessment of biofuel production.

TI  - Relationship of Microbial and Fertility Attributes to Organic Carbon Accumulation in a Subtropical Weathered Soil Impacted by a Long-Term Tillage Chronosequence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of crop residues by tillage is a key determinant that affects microbial processes, leading to changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and fertility status. However, studies evaluating the long-term temporal changes caused by no-tillage (NT) system are still incipient. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 22-year tillage chronosequence on microbial activity and soil fertility attributes in a subtropical ecosystem in Brazil. Field experiments were conducted at two research sites. One site was located near Tibagi (Santa Branca Farm), and the other site was located near Ponta Grossa City (Frankanna Farm), Parana State, Brazil. The soils are classified as Typic Hapludoxes and the tillage chronosequence comprised five treatments: (i) native vegetation (NV); (ii) NT for 10 years (NT-10); (iii) NT for 20 years (NT-20); (iv) NT for 22 years (NT-22); and (v) conventional tillage for 22 years (CT-22). We determined soil microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) and nitrogen (MB-N), basal respiration (BR), microbial quotient (MB-C and SOC ratio), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), total polysaccharides (TP), and fertility attributes (pH, N, S, P and effective CEC). A strong interaction between soil management and microbial activity soil fertility attributes was observed. NV exhibited higher MB-C and MB-N and lower BR and qCO(2), suggesting that NV could support a more stable ecosystem. CT-22 depleted soil C, N, S and P concentrations, but increasing NT time restored their concentrations. There were 34%, 42% and 48% less SOC (-14.9 g C kg(-1)), N (-1.4 g N kg(-1)) and S (-0.13 g S kg(-1)), respectively, in CT-22 in relation to the NT-22 soil at 0 to 5 cm depth. In addition, CT-22 showed significantly (p<0.05) lower MB-C, MB-N and a high qCO(2), indicating intense competition among soil microbes for available C. The study emphasized NT system potential to sequester C in soils. Although further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, it can indicate that microbial communities with high C use efficiency drive SOC sequestration and this occurred more in NT than in CT.

TI  - Time since fire as a driver of taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns of grassland plant communities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire plays a key role in grasslands, determining the distribution and evolution of species and boundaries with neighboring ecosystems. Evidence of community-wide responses to fire is largely based on taxonomic and functional descriptors, while the phylogenetic dimension is overlooked. Here we evaluated how the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of grassland plant communities responded to a time since fire (TSF) gradient. We sampled 12 communities in Southern Brazil under varying TSF and calculated taxonomic species richness (S) and dominance (D), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and mean phylogenetic distances (MPD). We used Structural Equation Models to test the relationships between the environmental gradient and community descriptors. Communities with longer TSF presented higher PD and MPD but lower species richness and increased taxonomic dominance. These sites were dominated by monocots, specifically C4 grasses, but also presented exclusive clades, whereas recently-burned sites presented lower taxonomic dominance and more species distributed in a wider variety of clades. Our results indicate that these scenarios are interchangeable and dependent on fire management. Fire adaptation was not constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, contrasting with previous findings for tropical savannahs and indicating that temperate and tropical non-forest ecosystems from South America respond differently to fire, possibly due to different evolutionary histories.

TI  - Quantifying above- and belowground biomass carbon loss with forest conversion in tropical lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia)
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests in South-East Asia have been extensively converted into other land-use systems in the past decades and still show high deforestation rates. Historically, lowland forests have been converted into rubber forests, but more recently, the dominant conversion is into oil palm plantations. While it is expected that the large-scale conversion has strong effects on the carbon cycle, detailed studies quantifying carbon pools and total net primary production (NPPtotal) in above- and belowground tree biomass in land-use systems replacing rainforest (incl. oil palm plantations) are rare so far. We measured above- and belowground carbon pools in tree biomass together with NPPtotal in natural old-growth forests, jungle rubber' agroforests under natural tree cover, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in Sumatra. In total, 32 stands (eight plot replicates per land-use system) were studied in two different regions. Total tree biomass in the natural forest (mean: 384Mgha(-1)) was more than two times higher than in jungle rubber stands (147Mgha(-1)) and >four times higher than in monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations (78 and 50Mgha(-1)). NPPtotal was higher in the natural forest (24Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) than in the rubber systems (20 and 15Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), but was highest in the oil palm system (33Mgha(-1)yr(-1)) due to very high fruit production (15-20Mgha(-1)yr(-1)). NPPtotal was dominated in all systems by aboveground production, but belowground productivity was significantly higher in the natural forest and jungle rubber than in plantations. We conclude that conversion of natural lowland forest into different agricultural systems leads to a strong reduction not only in the biomass carbon pool (up to 166MgCha(-1)) but also in carbon sequestration as carbon residence time (i.e. biomass-C:NPP-C) was 3-10 times higher in the natural forest than in rubber and oil palm plantations.

TI  - Gender influences decisions to change land use practices in the tropical forest margins of Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the role of gender as a factor in decision making about alternative land use options and in responses to new investment opportunities, which has received little attention to date. An observational study to determine the different factors affecting male and female decisions to change land use at the individual level in a forest margin landscape in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia) was combined with a set of role playing games (RPGs) designed to assess participant responses in a simulated social setting of women-only and men-only groups. The RPG included simulated agents offering new opportunities to convert or conserve agroforest. In the study area, rubber (Hevea braziliensis) agroforests that support high biodiversity and carbon storage are giving way to monoculture rubber and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations. When women from both the upland and lowland villages played the RPGs, external investors proposing logging or oil palm conversion were approached very positively and the resulting land use change was more dynamic and extensive than in the equivalent men-only groups. Consequently, women outperformed men in achieving income targets. In lowland areas gender is strongly associated with land use change, while in the uplands the level of conservation awareness plays a more crucial role in the maintenance of rubber agroforests. Based on the data, and contrary to expectations and gender stereotypes, it is expected that the greater involvement of women in landscape level decision making will increase emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the area, posing further challenges to efforts to reduce such emissions.

TI  - Certification of acai agroforestry increases the conservation potential of the Amazonian tree flora
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The harvesting of acai berries (palm fruits from the genus Euterpe) in Amazonia has increased over the last 20 years due to a high local and global market demand and triggered by their widely acclaimed health benefits as a 'superfood'. Although such increase represents a financial boom for local communities, unregulated extraction in Amazonia risks negative environmental effects including biodiversity loss through acai intensification and deforestation. Alternatively, the introduction of certified sustainable agroforestry production programs of acai has been strategically applied to reduce the exploitation of Amazonian forests. Local acai producers are required to follow principles of defined sustainable management practices, environmental guidelines, and social behaviors, paying specific attention to fair trade and human rights. In this study we investigate whether sustainable agroforestry and certification effectively promotes biodiversity conservation in Amazonia. To address this question, we conducted a forestry inventory in two hectares of long-term certified acai harvesting areas to gain further knowledge on the plant diversity and forest structure in acai managed forests and to understand the contribution of certification towards sustainable forest management. On average, we found that certified managed forests harbor 50% more tree species than non-certified acai groves. Trees in certified areas also have significantly higher mean basal area, meaning larger and hence older individuals are more likely to be protected. Certified harvesting sites also harbor dense populations of threatened species as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. Virola surinamensis, classified as 'endangered'). Besides increasing the knowledge of plant diversity in acai managed areas, we present baseline information for monitoring the impact of harvesting activities in natural ecosystems in Amazonia.

TI  - A bolder conservation future for Indonesia by prioritising biodiversity, carbon and unique ecosystems in Sulawesi
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As more ambitious protected area (PA) targets for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework are set beyond Aichi Target 11, renew thinking into spatial prioritisation is required to enable PA expansion that maximises environmental values. Our study focuses on the biodiverse and forest-rich Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which has a terrestrial PA network that covers 10% of the island. We used Marxan to investigate trade-offs in the design of an expanded PA network that prioritised different conservation features (biodiversity, forest cover, carbon stock, karst and valuable metal-rich areas) under varying island-wide coverage targets (17%, 30%, and 50%). Our first scenario, which required existing PAs to be selected, required larger areas to meet these coverage targets, in contrast to our second scenario, which allowed for any part of the island to be chosen, irrespective of PA status. The vast Mekongga and Bangkiriang Landscapes, and Gorontalo corridor were consistently identified as a high priority for protection under all scenarios. To meet our conservation targets through expanding current PAs, creating new PAs, and creating corridors that connect existing PAs, we used a spatially explicit three-phase approach. Our findings identified 26,508 km(2) of priority areas to be included in the current PA network, potentially assisting Indonesia in meeting its post-2020 GBF target, if our approach is replicated across Indonesia as a national or sub-national analysis. We discuss various land management options through other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) and the costs to deliver this strategy.

CL  - Mindanao State Univ, Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Studies on waste in Indonesia has intensified after this country was identified as the second most plastic waste in the world. The study site was in Pulau Rambut Wildlife Sanctuary (Jakarta Bay area), where 13 rivers ended in the bay. Waste that has landed in Pulau Rambut could disturb waterbirds's habitat. Waste was usually classified by using foreign country's situation. Researchers usually classify waste into 6 categories: plastic, metal, glass, rubber, processed lumber/paper, and cloth/fabric. These categories are then divided in more detail, e.g. 18 types of plastic and 3 types of metal. However, some of the wastes that has been found were not classified yet. The objective of this paper was to propose classification of waste that has landed on small island in Indonesia. We identified waste that has landed in Pulau Rambut then reviewed and modified the standard classification by NOAA and UNEP. The proposed classification is organic and non-organic. This classification is to be applied for the waste that landed on small island. For household waste in urban area or along the rivers need to be developed further..

TI  - Investing in local capacity to respond to a federal environmental mandate: Forest & economic impacts of the Green Municipality Program in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, the Brazilian federal government has offered a negative collective incentive to reduce deforestation by 'blacklisting' the municipalities in the Amazon with the highest deforestation rates. As for any unfunded mandate, the responses to blacklisting depend on both local incentives and local capacities. We evaluate a state program - Programa Municipios Verdes (PMV) or the Green Municipality Program - to increase the capacity of municipal governments in the state of Para to respond to this federal incentive. The PMV is voluntary, as municipal governments choose whether to participate. To control for differences due to self-selection into the program, we employ quasi-experimental methods: two-way, fixed-effects regressions in matched samples of municipalities; and the synthetic control method that compares outcomes in a participating municipality to outcomes in a weighted blend of control municipalities. Neither approach suggests that the PMV reduced deforestation beyond the effect of the blacklist. We hypothesize that municipalities joined the PMV to ameliorate the costs of complying with blacklist requirements, including the costs of exiting the blacklist. We show that the PMV increased total value added - with substantial heterogeneity - in participating blacklisted municipalities, and that these gains likely are not due to agricultural intensification. They may result from reductions in compliance risk and cost that make economic investments in a municipality more appealing. In the long run, this could make forest conservation more socially and politically sustainable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil organic C affected by dry-season management of no-till soybean crop rotations in the tropics
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Cover crop species selection for soybean (Glycine max) production under no-tillage (NT) management may affect soil organic C sequestration by altering the quantity and quality of C inputs, thereby affecting cropping system sustainability. If so, the underlying mechanisms for such regulation are still unclear. Methods We assessed changes in soil C and N fractions at 0-0.1 m depth and soil C stock at 0-0.6 m depth during the last three years of dry-season cover cropping in a soybean production system managed with NT for 9 years on a Rhodic Hapludox in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dry-season management treatments were repeated yearly in a split-plot scheme. Main plots during the fall-winter were (1) ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis), (2) grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and (3) the intercropping of ruzigrass and sorghum. Subplots during spring prior to planting soybean were (a) pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), (b) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and (c) forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Results Soil C and N fractions were affected according to crop residue characteristics of the rotations. Higher soil C stocks in 2012 and 2015 (7 % an average) were observed at 0.2-0.4 m depth by ruzigrass compared to sorghum. High crop residue input with ruzigrass in the fall-winter sequestered 0.61 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1) at 0-0.1 m soil depth compared with lower C sequestration using grain sorghum (0.29 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1)). Conclusions The quantity and quality of crop residues impact its retention on soil surface controlling the dynamics of soil C and N fractions and can be considered relevant for soil C sequestration. These aspects could contribute to the mitigation of atmospheric CO2 in crop production systems.

TI  - Modeling soil organic matter changes under crop diversification strategies and climate change scenarios in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, land conversion and agricultural management have historically accounted for the largest share of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the Cerrado region being one of the most affected areas. Although cropping diversification has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate GHG emissions through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, the long-term effects of these systems in the Cerrado are unknown. The DayCent model was used to simulate the impact of crop diversification and tillage on SOC dynamics until 2070 ( 50 years), including common crop succession systems and crop rotations associated with cover crops under climate change scenarios. First, we calibrated and evaluated the DayCent model using plant and soil observations from three sites in the region, where Pearson coefficients (r values) ranged from 0.50 to 0.94 (calibration sites) and 0.53-0.99 (validation site) for crop yields, SOC, and nitrogen. We then used the model to investigate how cropping systems and climate interact to control SOC levels. Results indicate that SOC stocks would decrease under the long-term (50 years) soybean-cotton succession, regardless of soil management (-0.04 to -0.17 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Crop diversification with crop rotation and cover crops (i.e., millet, ruzigrass, sunn hemp) had the highest SOC accrual potential ( 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)), resulting in SOC stocks of up to 130 Mg C ha(-1) by 2070. Ruzigrass, either single or intercropped with maize on crop succession systems, showed substantial potential for SOC sequestration ( 0.55 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and could be a viable strategy if implementing more complex rotations is not feasible. The SSP2 - 4.5 and SSP5 - 8.5 climate change scenarios increased SOC stocks by 6.3 and 8.2% in SOC across treatments by 2070, respectively. Results suggest that diversified cropping systems are a promising strategy for increasing SOC sequestration, and they offer valuable guidance for enhancing current management practices in the region.

TI  - Nocturnal Bees as Crop Pollinators
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Bees are typically diurnal but around 1% of described species have nocturnal activity. Nocturnal bees are still poorly studied due to bias towards studying diurnal insects. However, knowledge concerning their biology and role as crop pollinators has increased. We review the literature on nocturnal bees' traits and their host plants, and assess the crop pollination effectiveness of this neglected group. Nocturnal bees have visual adaptations to cope with low light intensities, and floral scents are a key sensory cue used to find their host flowers. Nocturnal bees generally show high flower constancy, the ability to vibrate flowers, and high transfer rates of pollen grains to stigmas. The flowers visited by nocturnal bees range from small radial and zygomorphic flowers to large brush blossoms; moreover, they visit plants with different flowering strategies. Nocturnal bees are effective pollinators of regional fruit crops in Brazil, such as cambuci (Campomanesia phaea), guarana (Paullinia cupana), caja (Spondias mombin), and in North America of cultivated pumpkins (Cucurbita species). However, they most likely are pollinators of several other crops. Strategies to host high numbers of nocturnal bees around cropping areas should be taken, such as preserving adjacent native forests, restricting soil management, providing food resources beyond crop flowers, and avoiding light pollution.

TI  - Earthworms in the state of Parana, Brazil: State of the art
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Parana State has approximately 74 % of its territory destined for agricultural activities. Several agricultural management practices modify soil quality and biodiversity, including earthworm populations that can contribute to soil health. This study aimed to review the studies carried out in the state of Parana, Brazil, focusing on earthworm populations (abundance, biomass, richness, proportion of native and exotic species) in different land-use systems. In total, 51 publications were compiled, including peer reviewed papers, book chapters, dissertations and theses. We used studies that analyzed chemical and physical soil properties (n = 14) to perform a principal component analysis to explore the relationships between these properties and earthworm populations. In total, 90 earthworm species are known from Parana, of which more than half (n = 46) may be new species that still must be formally described. Of the total, 24 are exotic and 66 are native species, though only 62 (16 %) of the 399 counties have earthworm records. Of the land-use categories sampled, the lowest abundance and biomass were recorded in annual crops under conventional tillage, and the highest populations were found in agroforestry systems. Higher earthworm abundance and species richness were related to higher chemical fertility (soil P and base contents), while biomass was related to higher silt and sand contents.

TI  - Forest conservation maximises acai palm pollination services and yield in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Agricultural expansion is one of the main drivers of global pollinator loss. Paradoxically, this occurs while agriculture is becoming increasingly dependent on biotic pollination, raising concerns about food production. Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP), the use of both wild and managed pollinators in crop fields, can help conserve pollinator diversity while ensuring effective pollination services for growers. However, given the context-dependent nature of this approach, there is an urgent need to evaluate its application across different landscapes and crops.2. We apply the ICP approach to acai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon to explore effects of a native stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff. postica (Apidae: Meliponini), and landscape-level forest conservation on yield and socioeconomic outcomes for acai fruit growers. We assessed flower visitor assemblages and fruit production on 18 plantations across a landscape forest cover gradient, with bee colonies introduced on nine plantations. Field data were combined with information from semistructured interviews of growers to estimate yield and profit per hectare under different pollinator management scenarios.3. Bee colonies and forest cover enhanced flower visitor abundance on palm inflorescences, but abundance increases attributed to managed bees were associated with shifts in flower visitor evenness and diversity (species richness), due to reduced visitation of wild bees near managed colonies.4. Fruit production on inflorescences was positively related to bee abundance and bee diversity. Consequently, overall pollination performance was lower in plantations with bee colonies. This was repeated at the hectare scale, where yield and profit were associated with surrounding forest cover and not bee colonies.5. Synthesis and applications. Managed bees can increase pollinator densities and fruit production, but the increased environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with this activity means acai growers should prioritise forest conservation to safeguard pollination services and improve overall sustainability of acai production in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Silvopastoral management of beef cattle production for neutralizing the environmental impact of enteric methane emission
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well recognized that commercial beef cattle production systems have a major impact on climate change, mainly due to the emission of enteric methane (CH4). The objective of this research was to evaluate if integrating animal + pasture + timber production in silvopastoral systems (SPS) would help neutralize the impact of enteric CH4 emission by facilitating carbon storage as soil organic carbon (SOC). This paper reports a study conducted in Brazil with a herd of 150 cows in 100 ha of Urochloa brizantha with Eucalyptus urograndis, on four tree configurations: SPS 1-clone GG-100 at 2 x 3 x 15 m spacing; SPS 2-clone i-144 at 2 x 3 x 15 m; SPS 3-clone GG-100 at 3 x 15 m; and SPS 4-clone i-144 at 3 x 15 m. Based on data collected through eight consecutive years, the gas balance was estimated. For all SPS treatments average, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) of additional C stock exceeded the emissions. Considering only C sequestration from trees, the average CO(2)e sequestration was - 26.27 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1), while the average emissions of CO2 e was 23.54 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1) for enteric CH4 + pasture + tree, giving a net balance of - 2.73 Mg center dot CO(2)e ha(-1). The "loss" of CO(2)e analyzed was compensated by the soil C sequestration in long-lived SOC pools, enhancing the resilience of farming systems by increasing soil organic matter and soil fertility capacity, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, providing benefits in livestock production and for environmental remediation.

TI  - Selective logging intensity and time since logging drive tropical bird and dung beetle diversity: a case study from Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how selective logging affects biodiversity is crucial to planning cost-effective conservation strategies in tropical forests, yet there is limited understanding of its impacts on fauna functional diversity in the tropical Americas. We assessed how selective logging intensification and time since logging influence multiple metrics of fauna functional integrity in the Brazilian Amazon by collecting bird and dung beetle data within 48 logging management units that had experienced varying exploitation intensities between 1.5-2.0 and 5.0-6.0 years before the faunal surveys. We investigated assemblage responses and used functional attributes to assess changes in functional diversity, specialization, originality and species rarity. Using point counts and pitfall traps, we collected 5081 records of 182 bird species and 7892 dung beetles from 45 species. Logging intensification led to significant declines in most dung beetle responses and bird body mass, whereas time since logging was a key driver of dung beetle and bird functional and taxonomic diversity. Our study presents novel empirical evidence of how logging intensification effects vary across taxa, ecological metrics and time since logging, which is key to informing forest conservation and further investigating environmental degradation impacts on tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Short-term buildup of carbon from a low-productivity pastureland to an agrisilviculture system in the Brazilian savannah
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrisilviculture systems that combine two or more species with agricultural practices may potentially increase soil organic matter (SOM) quality due to its diversified and large carbon (C) inputs. The implementation of integrated agricultural systems in Brazil has reached over 11 Mha of area and is a promising strategy to revert widespread land degradation and increase ecological intensification for cropping systems. This study aimed to evaluate the transition of a low-productivity pasture to an agrisilviculture system (corn + Gliricidia sepium + Panicum maximum cv. Massai) along a four-year field experiment under a clayey Oxisol on SOM fractions, C stocks and C management index (CMI). A native Cerrado vegetation was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected in four cropping seasons: T0 - under low-productivity pasture, T1, T2, T3 - 2nd, 3rd and 4th years after implementing the integrated production system, respectively. Both mineral associated and total soil organic C (TC) increased from TO to T3. Accordingly, C from the particulate SOM increased by 476%, 305% and 368% at 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m layers, respectively, and was found to be the most sensitive indicator for changes in soil management systems. Surprisingly, inert C increased up to 0.20 m layer from TO to all the other seasons and represented 21 to 42% of TC. C stocks at the 0.00-0.40 m layer increased from 52.6 Mg ha(-1) at TO to 66.5 Mg ha(-1) at T3. The CMI significantly increased from TO to T3 - reaching CMI of native vegetation (considered CMI = 100%). The no-till agrisilviculture system with the use of Panicum maximum cv. Massai and Gliricidia sepium managed to accomplish the goal of building up soil organic C and increasing SOM quality, thus showing its potential to be used as a sustainable agricultural practice in terms of soil quality improvement and short-term C sequestration.

TI  - Limited effects of low-intensity forest management on ant assemblages in southwestern Amazonian forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - One important strategy to conciliate forest conservation and economic development is the use of reduced-impact logging techniques. Here we evaluated the effects of low-intensity forest management on ant assemblages and vegetation structure in a managed area in the southeast of Acre State, Brazil. Ground-dwelling and arboreal ants, and several forest-structure descriptors were sampled in nine paired areas located in control (unlogged) and logged areas in 2005, 2007 and 2009. None of the forest structure predictors were related with either the treatment or the time since logging. However, some ant assemblage' descriptors were related with logging activities. Arboreal and ground-dwelling ant species richness was similar between unlogged and logged areas, but more ground-dwelling ant species were found in areas logged in 2005 compared with areas logged in 2009. Ground-dwelling ant assemblage composition differed between treatments (logged and unlogged) and year of logging, but species composition heterogeneity was similar between areas. Arboreal ant assemblage composition was not related with treatment and year of logging, but assemblage composition was more heterogeneous in managed areas, suggesting that species that forage on the understory vegetation may be more resilient than ground-dwelling species. The general results of functional group approach suggest that changes of species composition between control and managed areas are more related with differences in ant species occurrence than ant species richness. Selective logging had limited effect on both vegetation descriptors and ant assemblage structure, suggesting that the conciliation of impact reduction techniques with low intensity extraction seems a promising alternative for sustainable logging activity in tropical forests.

TI  - Intensification of land use in Neotropical environments determines loss of taxonomic and functional diversity of spiders.
T2  - Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure and complexity of landscapes can significantly impact the composition and functional traits of spiders, given their strong response to environmental changes. Understanding these effects helps to assess the impact of agricultural practices on spider communities. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of land use and management systems on taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as changes in spider functional traits. Conducted in the eastern and western regions of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, the study focused on land use systems (LUS), including native forest (NF), eucalyptus reforestation (ER), pasture (PA), crop-livestock integration (CLI), and no-tillage (NT). The sampling of the eastern region occurred between July, August and December 2011 and January 2012 and in the western region occurred in April, August 2018. Each collection site represented a sampling station with up to 1 km distance between stations, totaling 888 sampling points. Two collection methods were employed: Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) and pitfall traps. Spider functional diversity was assessed based on eight functional traits. Taxonomic diversity was evaluated through richness, and indices such as FRic, FEve, FDis, FDiv, and CWM were calculated. Generalized linear models (GLMM) were applied to compare the indices. The highest functional and taxonomic richness of spiders was found in native forest (NF). Functional traits, particularly dispersal capacity and stratum preference, showed significant variation across land use systems (LUS), with CLI and PA exhibiting the greatest impacts on functional diversity. The intensity of management practices appears to favor generalist species that are more just more plastic, tolerant and/or dispersive to environmental changes, which could lead to functional biotic homogenization.

TI  - Agroforestry systems recover tree carbon stock faster than natural succession in Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for atmospheric carbon sequestration in degraded tropical lands is of key interest for climate change and rural development policies. This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0-20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 +/- 2.0 and 47.2 +/- 8.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 +/- 2.5 and 26.5 +/- 19.5 Mg ha(-1)). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 +/- 11.0 Mg ha(-1)), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 +/- 5.1 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 +/- 7.5 Mg ha(-1)). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (+/- 16) in AFS and 35% (+/- 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon.

TI  - Eucalyptus PLANTATION BENEFITS TO PATCH SIZE AND SHAPE OF FORESTED AREAS IN SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of mixed plantation systems (exotic and native species) is viable and represents an important alternative in the context of forest and landscape restoration. This study evaluated whether Eucalyptus cultivation is associated with changes in native forest cover and fragment connectivity in the region from 1987 to 2017. The study region (Southeast Atlantic Forest) has been undergoing a forest transition process. Based on land use/land cover maps obtained from satellite images and a pair-wise comparison, it was detected that the dynamics in one land cover were not necessarily associated with the other one. It was verified an increase in Eucalyptus cover since 2007, possibly related to the New Forest Code that allows the use of exotic species in reforestation, provided it does not exceed 50% of the total area. An increase in the native vegetation cover was also observed, highlighting the importance of restoration actions and national regulations. In addition, forest patches were larger and less complex with Eucalyptus presence, indicating that this land cover is potentially beneficial for the landscape connectivity.

TI  - Carbon stock in soil and aggregates in Ultisol under different management of long duration
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the content and stock of total organic carbon in the soil and aggregates of a Red-Yellow Ultisol under management systems-conventional tillage with disc plow, disc plow plus harrow, harrow and only no-tillage system in an experiment conducted over 23 years in the Zona da Mata region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A remnant of native forest was used as reference. Soil samples were collected at different layers, to evaluate the total organic carbon based on soil mass, their storage in the soil depth and total organic carbon content in macro, meso and microaggregates. The results showed that in the long term, no-tillage system stored 1.5 Mg ha(-1) total organic carbon in the surface layer. In the conventional management, the balance was negative, soil lost around 1.0 Mg ha(-1) of organic carbon. There was no recovery of carbon in the deeper layers of all evaluated systems. The content of total organic carbon in aggregates varied with the size and form of adopted management, with higher accumulation in macroaggregates.

AB  - Koneri R, Nangoy MJ, Maabuat PV, Saroyo, Wakhid. 2022. Diversity and composition of butterflies in three habitats around Rayow Waterfall, Minahasa District, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 1091-1098. Butterflies play an important role in ecosystems as pollinating agents, and their beautiful colors have a high potential for ecotourism activities. This study aims to analyze the diversity and composition of butterflies on three habitats around Rayow Waterfall, Minahasa District, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, which might be developed as ecotourism paths for butterfly-watching. Butterfly sampling using the sweeping technique was conducted on ecotourism paths in three habitat types: residential, agroforestry, and waterfall. Each ecotourism path consisted of three transect lines with a length of each transect of 300 m. The results showed 5 families of butterflies consisting of 56 species and 943 individuals. The most common family and species found were Nymphalidae and Eurema tominia (Snellen van Vollenhoven, 1865), and the highest abundance, number, and diversity index were found in agroforestry habitat. Meanwhile, the composition of butterflies differed significantly across the three habitats. Waterfall habitat was characterized by high relative humidity and low air temperature, while the high air temperature characterized residential habitat. The highest diversity of butterflies was found in the agroforestry habitat, and this was because of the complex vegetation structure that supported the survival of butterflies. The result of this study can serve as baseline information for the development of butterfly-based tourism programs in the Rayow Waterfall.

TI  - Regeneration after fire in campo rupestre: Short- and long-term vegetation dynamics
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering 22% of the country, and campo rupestre is one of the most biodiverse ecosystem. Campo rupestre are extremely old mountaintop tropical ecosystems, composed of a mosaic of herbaceous, shrubland and savanna vegetation, generally located above 900 m above sea level characterized by shallow, acidic and nutrient-poor soils. In the context of increased land-use changes, effective conservation and management projects appear necessary to guarantee the conservation of these ecosystems. Although fire is a natural disturbance in campo rupestre, the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of fire on vegetation recovery and plant composition on both the short- and long-term in the main herbaceous vegetation types: the sandy and stony grasslands. We monitored plant community composition before and after a wildfire in order to assess the short- term vegetation recovery. Diachronic analyses of grasslands burnt at various dates were used to understand the effects of fire on the long-term vegetation dynamics. Our results highlighted a rapid recovery of campo rupestre vegetation after wildfires, suggesting a high adaptation to fire of plant communities. We did not find a significant variation in species richness of sandy grasslands according to time after fire, whereas higher species richness was observed in the recently burnt stony grasslands. No change in plant composition of campo rupestre in response to fire was highlighted, probably due to the high heterogeneity of this ecosystem. After fire, biomass gradually increased over time in both vegetation types. High biomass accumulation could lead to stronger fires. Further studies are necessary to understand the relationship between biomass accumulation and fire intensity in campo rupestre in order to set up adapted fire management strategies to conserve campo rupestre biodiversity.

TI  - CARBON STOCK AND ITS COMPARTMENTS IN A SUBTROPICAL OXISOL UNDER LONG-TERM TILLAGE AND CROP ROTATION SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a crucial role in soil quality and can act as an atmospheric C-CO2 sink under conservationist management systems. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects (19 years) of tillage (CT-conventional tillage and NT-no tillage) and crop rotations (R0-monoculture system, R1-winter crop rotation, and R2- intensive crop rotation) on total, particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon (C) stocks of an originally degraded Red Oxisol in Cruz Alta, RS, Southern Brazil. The climate is humid subtropical Cfa 2a (Koppen classification), the mean annual precipitation 1,774 mm and mean annual temperature 19.2 degrees C. The plots were divided into four segments, of which each was sampled in the layers 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.30 m. Sampling was performed manually by opening small trenches. The SOM pools were determined by physical fractionation. Soil C stocks had a linear relationship with annual crop C inputs, regardless of the tillage systems. Thus, soil disturbance had a minor effect on SOM turnover. In the 0-0.30 m layer, soil C sequestration ranged from 0 to 0.51 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), using the CT R0 treatment as base-line; crop rotation systems had more influence on soil stock C than tillage systems. The mean C sequestration rate of the cropping systems was 0.13 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) higher in NT than CT. This result was associated to the higher C input by crops due to the improvement in soil quality under long-term no-tillage. The particulate C fraction was a sensitive indicator of soil management quality, while mineral-associated organic C was the main pool of atmospheric C fixed in this clayey Oxisol. The C retention in this stable SOM fraction accounts for 81 and 89% of total C sequestration in the treatments NT R1 and NT R2, respectively, in relation to the same cropping systems under CT. The highest C management index was observed in NT R2, confirming the capacity of this soil management practice to improve the soil C stock qualitatively in relation to CT R0. The results highlighted the diversification of crop rotation with cover crops as a crucial strategy for atmospheric C-CO2 sequestration and SOM quality improvement in highly weathered subtropical Oxisols.

TI  - SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN STOCKS IN TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL AND AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS IN THE SEMIARID REGION OF BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semiarid region of Brazil, inadequate management of cropping systems and low plant biomass production can contribute to reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks; therefore, management systems that preserve C and N must be adopted. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks that were promoted by agroforestry (agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral) and traditional agricultural systems (slash-and-burn clearing and cultivation for two and three years) and to compare these systems with the natural Caatinga vegetation after 13 years of cultivation. The experiment was carried out on a typical Ortic Chromic Luvisol in the municipality of Sobral, Ceara, Brazil. Soil samples were collected (layers 0-6, 6-12, 12-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) with four replications. The plain, convex and concave landforms in each study situation were analyzed, and the total organic C, total N and densities of the soil samples were assessed. The silvopastoral system promoted the greatest long-term reductions in C and N stocks, while the agrosilvopastoral system promoted the smallest losses and therefore represents a sustainable alternative for soil C and N sequestration in these semiarid conditions. The traditional agricultural system produced reductions of 58.87 and 9.57 Mg ha(-1) in the organic C and total N stocks, respectively, which suggests that this system is inadequate for these semiarid conditions. The organic C stocks were largest in the concave landform in the agrosilvopastoral system and in the plain landform in the silvopastoral system, while the total N values were highest in the concave landform in the native, agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems.

TI  - Exploring mammalian diversity in a human-modified landscape: insights from a small Cerrado fragment surrounded by silviculture
T2  - MAMMALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural environments have undergone significant alteration and devastation, often becoming immersed in a matrix of anthropogenic activities. Therefore, it is imperative to ascertain whether mammals inhabit these modified areas. We present the composition of medium and large-sized terrestrial mammal species in a Cerrado area surrounded by a eucalyptus matrix. Our study area comprises a 363 ha Cerrado fragment. Surveys were conducted using 10 camera traps from December 2015 to April 2017, totaling 125 sampling stations and a sampling effort of 3,018 trap-days. We identified 19 mammal species, seven of them regionally threatened (37 %), representing 61 % of the potential species pool in the region. Omnivores and insectivores accounted for most of the recorded species. Notably, records include the Priodontes maximus, Tapirus terrestris, and Ozotoceros bezoarticus, cubs and a predation record. Given that T. terrestris was recorded only in our study and P. maximus in a single other study in the region, our findings suggest that these species can inhabit small vegetation fragments. Additionally, we include O. bezoarticus in the list of mammals inhabiting the region. Our study underscores the capacity of Cerrado fragments surrounded by silviculture to harbor a rich diversity of medium and large-sized mammals, especially considering those threatened with extinction.

TI  - Differences in seed rain composition in small and large fragments in the northeast Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are seriously threatened by fragmentation and habitat loss. The impact of fragment size and forest configuration on the composition of seed rain is insufficiently studied. For the present study, seed rain composition of small and large forest fragments (8388 ha) was assessed in order to identify variations in seed abundance, species richness, seed size and dispersal mode. Seed rain was documented during a 1-year period in three large and four small Atlantic Forest fragments that are isolated by a sugarcane matrix. Total seed rain included 20,518 seeds of 149 species of trees, shrubs, palms, lianas and herbs. Most species and seeds were animal-dispersed. A significant difference in the proportion of seeds and species within different categories of seed size was found between small and large fragments. Small fragments received significantly more very small-sized seeds (<0.3 cm) and less large-seeded species (>1.5 cm) that were generally very rare, with only one species in small and eight in large fragments. We found a negative correlation between the inflow of small-sized seeds and the percentage of forest cover. Species richness was lower in small than in large fragments, but the difference was not very pronounced. Given our results, we propose changing plant species pools through logging, tree mortality and a high inflow of pioneer species and lianas, especially in small forest fragments and areas with low forest cover. Connecting forest fragments through corridors and reforestation with local large-seeded tree species may facilitate the maintenance of species diversity.

TI  - Fragment size and the disassembling of local bird communities in the Atlantic Forest: A taxonomic and functional approach
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss is the primary driver of the decline of biodiversity in ecological communities. However, which ecological processes are implicated in the removal of species following habitat loss, i.e. the disassembling of the community, remains unclear in many ecosystems. We address this question by investigating how the taxonomic and functional diversity of bird assemblages are related to fragment size in the Atlantic Forest from northeastern Brazil. We used complementary metrics of diversity and a randomization procedure to test whether changes in diversity result from either random or deterministic processes, such as limiting similarity or habitat filtering. The species-area (SAR) and functional richness-area (FAR) relationships were positive, as expected. However, the FAR had a lower slope than the SAR, which indicates a slower loss of functional richness than that predicted by the loss of species richness. Communities in smaller fragments contain more functionally overdispersed species and a more even distribution of abundance. These results indicate that limiting similarity drives the disassembling of bird assemblages in small fragments of the Atlantic Forest, which presumably reflects increased competition. This dynamic tends to reduce functional redundancy in the impoverished assemblages, with potentially deleterious consequences for ecosystem functioning and forest conservation.

TI  - Effect of 26-years of soil tillage systems and winter cover crops on C and N stocks in a Southern Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil management and crop rotation are key factors in controlling the accumulation of C and N in the soil profile, but their long-term effect remains poorly understood for deep soil layers, especially in subtropical conditions. Using a long-term experiment (26-years), this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different soil management systems associated with different winter cover crops on C and N accumulation in a very clayey (72 % clay) soil up to 1 m deep. Two tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] were cultivated with eight winter cover crops (black oat, rye, common vetch, hairy vetch, oilseed radish, wheat, blue lupine, and fallow) in a subtropical Oxisol from Southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in eight soil layers up to 1.00 m soil depth after 26 years of experiment and, also from an adjacent native forest. After forest clearing, the C stock in the 0.00-0.20 m soil layer was reduced by 45 % in only 10 years (from 1976 to 1986) of soil tillage. Twenty-six years after the beginning of the experiment, C and N stock in 0.00-0.20 m soil layer were 13 and 20 % higher in NT compared to CT, with the greatest differences in C and N content observed in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. When associated with winter cover crops, NT accumulated 0.6 and 0.06 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) more C and N than CT with winter fallow in the 0.00-0.20 m soil layer. No-tillage and CT recovered 95 and 83 %, respectively, of the C stock found in the 0.00-0.20 m layer from the native forest. However, in the 0.00-1.00 m soil layer, the positive effect of NT on soil C accumulation compared to CT was diluted, and no clear effect of NT was verified. Moreover, no difference in winter cover crops on soil C and N stocks were observed in all soil layers, possibly due to their similar residues input (3.3-4.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). No-tillage associated with high biomass input through winter cover crops promoted a faster recovery of soil C and N stock than in CT and, therefore, is an efficient tool to improve soil C and N accumulation even in Oxisols with high clay content.

TI  - Rainforest transformation reallocates energy from green to brown food webs
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial animal biodiversity is increasingly being lost because of land-use change(1,2). However, functional and energetic consequences aboveground and belowground and across trophic levels in megadiverse tropical ecosystems remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed changes in energy fluxes across 'green' aboveground (canopy arthropods and birds) and 'brown' belowground (soil arthropods and earthworms) animal food webs in tropical rainforests and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our results showed that most of the energy in rainforests is channelled to the belowground animal food web. Oil palm and rubber plantations had similar or, in the case of rubber agroforest, higher total animal energy fluxes compared to rainforest but the key energetic nodes were distinctly different: in rainforest more than 90% of the total animal energy flux was channelled by arthropods in soil and canopy, whereas in plantations more than 50% of the energy was allocated to annelids (earthworms). Land-use change led to a consistent decline in multitrophic energy flux aboveground, whereas belowground food webs responded with reduced energy flux to higher trophic levels, down to -90%, and with shifts from slow (fungal) to fast (bacterial) energy channels and from faeces production towards consumption of soil organic matter. This coincides with previously reported soil carbon stock depletion(3). Here we show that well-documented animal biodiversity declines with tropical land-use change(4-6) are associated with vast energetic and functional restructuring in food webs across aboveground and belowground ecosystem compartments.

TI  - Bird Assemblages in Coffee Agroforestry Systems and Other Human Modified Habitats in Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Given the high degree of deforestation in the tropics due to shifting agriculture, it is a priority for conservation to find sustainable agriculture systems. We assessed bird communities over 1228 plots from 21 sites in the highly populated island of Java, Indonesia. We found that commercial coffee polycultures (i.e., fields comprised of coffee plants, other crops and/or fruit trees, and diverse shade trees) could sustain similar levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness than coffee systems under natural forests and community managed forests. Commercial coffee polyculture fields host higher bird abundance, diversity, and richness than sun-exposed coffee fields, fields with other crops or fruit trees, and tree farms. We provide evidence that complex commercial agroforestry systems can host similar levels of biodiversity to agroforestry systems under natural forest. Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in Java, Indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on Java from February to August 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade.

AB  - Arthropods have essential roles in the forest ecosystem; they act as herbivores, carnivores and detritivores in the food webs. This study aimed to analyze the diversity and abundance of arthropods inhabiting peat soil both in monoculture and polyculture plantation of balangeran (Shorea balangeran). The research was conducted in Riding Village, Ogan Komering Ilir District, South Sumatra, through an observation approach with pitfall trap and sweep nets, followed by selection and morphological identification. The identified arthropods were from 10 orders, and 24 families with the highest number of individuals belonged to the Forrnicidae family. The arthropods were classified mostly as predators (43.64%), closely followed by phytophag (38.18%), and the rest were parasitoid (14.54%) and pollinator (3.64%). The diversity index of arthropods under balangeran plants mixed with paddy and mixed with cajuput were 0.78, 0.65, and 0.93, respectively. The highest abundance of arthropods was found on balangeran plants mixed with paddy crop. These results revealed that planting systems have significant effects on diversity and abundance of peat soil arthropods.

TI  - Assessing humification and organic C compounds by laser-induced fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopies under conventional and no-till management in Brazilian Oxisols
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on humification is important to assessing the rate and magnitude of soil carbon (C) sequestration. Thus, this study assessed the humification degree (H-LIF) of soil organic matter (SOM) and the changes in functional C groups (aromatic-C and aliphatic-C) for contrasting land use and management practices (native vegetation (NV), conventional plow-based tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) systems) in sub-tropical and tropical Brazilian environments. Experiments were conducted at Ponta Grossa (PG) in Parana State and Lucas do Rio Verde (LRV) in Mato Grosso State of Brazil. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIFS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FIR) spectroscopies, were used on whole soil samples to 1-m depth, and on seven aggregate size classes (8-19, 4-8, 2-4, 1-2, 0.5-1, 0.25-0.5, 0.053-0.25 mm) obtained by wet sieving of 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers. Three functional C groups were selected based on FTIR: aliphatic-C-1 (1404 cm(-1)), aromatic-C (1632 cm(-1)), and aliphatic-C-2 (2852 and 2922 cm(-1)). The H-LIF was 3 to 5 times higher at the LRV site than at PG at all soil depths, indicating that selective preservation by aromaticity of SUM is the predominant mechanism in this environment. Relatively lower H-FIL was observed in NT soils at both locations because of aggregation which protects most labile moieties. The depletion of C concentration in CT was related to the decrease in functional C groups (i.e., aromatic-C and aliphatic-C) and an overall increase in the humification degree, indicating that physical protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect the labile fractions of OM. In contrast, the intensity of functional C groups under NT systems was similar to that in the soil under NV at both locations. A discriminant analysis of principal components clearly showed that soils at both locations can be clustered into three groups, corresponding to the three main land-use and management practices. Thus, soils under NV, NT, and CT differed significantly in terms of the composition of organic compounds, and in the interactions between inorganic and organic fractions. Land use changes modify the arrangement of organic compounds necessitating the diversification of agroecosystems and conversion to NT farming. Altogether, our results reveal that LIFS and FTIR are fast, efficient, and precise techniques for analyzing the degree of SOC humification, functional C groups, and hence the efficiency of NT cropping systems in promoting long-term carbon sequestration in soils.

TI  - Finding alternatives to swidden agriculture: does agroforestry improve livelihood options and reduce pressure on existing forest?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Swidden cultivation can contribute to deforestation and land degradation, which can subsequently result in a number of serious environmental problems. This paper examines the economic and social potential of agroforestry systems and the barriers to their widespread adoption, as a land use alternative to swidden cultivation, which may potentially help protect local forest. The Gunung Salak valley in West Java, Indonesia is presented as a case study. Based on farmers' and experts' assessment, costs and benefits have been estimated, which show that the two investigated agroforestry systems have higher net present value and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) than the two swidden cultivation systems. Tree ownership also creates more permanent rights to farmland and is prestigious in the community. Agroforestry products (fruit, vegetables etc.) have high monetary value and help strengthen social cohesion when shared with neighbors. However, farmers are reluctant to implement agroforestry. Stated reasons are related to both culture and capacity. Farmers practicing agroforestry are less involved in forest clearing and forest products collection than swidden farmers indicating that it may contribute positively to conservation of local forests. Increasing the adoption of agroforestry farming in the study area will require support to overcome capacity constraints.

TI  - Grassland degradation and restoration: a conceptual framework of stages and thresholds illustrated by southern Brazilian grasslands
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a complex concept that integrates different aspects, including changes in soil conditions, biodiversity, productivity and socio-economic implications, compared to a reference state. We propose a new conceptual framework to analyze degradation stages and restoration thresholds in species-rich natural grasslands. The framework integrates different degradation stages with their respective thresholds and describes key processes of land-use change that lead to certain stages and thresholds. Specifically, we discuss two scenarios of grassland degradation, i.e. unsuitable grassland management and complete change of land use, sometimes followed by spontaneous recovery. We illustrate the framework with the case of south Brazilian grasslands, which are rich in biodiversity, but suffer from a series of degradation processes and are poorly considered from a conservation perspective. The conceptual framework can be applied by studies on degradation and restorability of tropical and subtropical grasslands after changes in management or transition to other land use; it will facilitate decisions on alternative management and conservation.

TI  - Decomposition of black oat straw and pig slurry in a soil under no-tillage
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of pig slurry in no-tillage systems is relatively recent in South Brazil, so it is important to evaluate the decomposition of pig slurry as well as its effects on the cover crop residue decomposition in this system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pig slurry decomposition and its influence on the decomposition rate of black oat straw in a soil under no-tillage. Two experiments were carried out under field conditions in an experimental area of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), on a Hapludalf. The CO2-C emission was measured right after the application of 0 and 40 m(3) ha(-1) of pig slurry in static chambers, in the absence or in the presence of oat straw on the soil surface. The CO2-C emission was monitored for 62 days in experiment 1 and for 97 days in experiment 2. Pig slurry and oat straw showed a different decomposition pattern. While the pig slurry had an initial phase of fast CO2-C mineralization followed by a slower phase, CO2-C-liberation by oat straw was more constant. About one third of C added through pig slurry and oat straw was emitted to the atmosphere in the form of CO2-C. Results of this study showed that the decomposition rate of black oat straw was not influenced by pig slurry application in soil under no-tillage system.

TI  - Agricultural expansion in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso; implications for C stocks and greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso in Brazil together make up the world's largest agricultural frontier. Between 2001 and 2004, deforestation, to provide land for highly mechanized agriculture in this area, reached unprecedented rates. The environmental consequences of this include increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from above and below ground sources. In this area where agriculture is a relatively new activity, land use and management practices change rapidly as farmers react to market pressures but also use trial and error to increase productivity/reduce losses. Farmers routinely make use of the latest technologies making agricultural expansion very different from historical examples. The fact that systems are in a state of flux has implications for sustainability and the ability of scientists to produce local and national GHG inventories and project future GHG emissions and carbon stock changes. Such projections are necessary to assess the full environmental impacts of such large scale native vegetation loss and to inform policy makers accordingly.A pilot study of farmer interviews around the town of Sinop, Mato Grosso, found that land management methods have varied over time, with a recent trend emerging to move from monoculture systems to integrated crop/livestock systems. The interviews also revealed that management practices employed by the small (<500 ha) farms differed markedly from those employed by medium (>500 ha) and large (>10,000 ha) farms. Wider studies carried out in the neighbouring state of Rondonia have shown soil C stocks and GHG emissions to be highly dependent on agricultural management. We discuss the implications of rapidly changing management practices in the agricultural frontier region of Mato Grosso and Rondonia on past regional estimates of C stocks and GHG fluxes and future projections. The future outlook is discussed in the context of possibility of REDD being included in a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.

TI  - Revisiting the 'cornerstone of Amazonian conservation': a socioecological assessment of Brazil nut exploitation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The Brazil nut (the seeds of the rainforest tree Bertholletia excelsa) is the only globally traded seed collected from the wild by forest-based harvesters across the Amazon basin. The large geographic scale of Brazil nut exploitation and the significant contributions to local livelihoods, national economies, and forest-based development over the last decades, merit a review of the "conservation-through-use'' paradigm. We use Elinor Ostrom's framework for assessing sustainability in socioecological systems: (1) resource unit, (2) users, (3) governance system, and (4) resource system, to determine how different contexts and external developments generate specific conservation and development outcomes. We find that the resource unit reacts robustly to the type and level of extraction currently practiced; that resource users have built on a self-organized system that had defined boundaries and access to the resource; that linked production chains, market networks and informal financing work to supply global markets; and that local harvesters have used supporting alliances with NGOs and conservationists to formalize and secure their endogenous governance system and make it more equitable. As a result, the Brazil nut model represents a socioecological system that may not require major changes to sustain productivity. Yet since long-term Brazil nut production seems inextricably tied to a continuous forest cover, and because planted Brazil nut trees currently provide a minimal contribution to total nut production basin-wide, we call to preserve, diversify and intensify production in Brazil nut-rich forests that will inevitably become ever more integrated within human-modified landscapes over time.

TI  - Spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) in Agricultural Land Use Systems in Subtropical Environments
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use management in agricultural areas can affect the biodiversity of spider families. This study aimed to evaluate spider diversity in different land use systems with capture by two sampling methods, and to identify soil properties that can modulate the occurrence of spiders. Five land use systems, representative of traditional agricultural areas, were evaluated in the west of Santa Catarina, Brazil, to establish a scale of land use intensity: native forest, eucalyptus reforestation areas, pastures, crop-livestock integration areas, and annual crops under no-tillage. The collection methods were manual from soil monoliths and soil traps. Altogether 479 individuals were captured, which were distributed among 20 families, 40 genera, and 8 species. Principal component analysis separated the land use systems and showed an association of spider families with land use in the two sampling methods. There was reduction in spider diversity as the intensity of land use increased. The manual collection method was more efficient for families of soil spiders, whereas traps were more efficient for epigeic spiders. The Lycosidae family was more resistant to environmental pressures, while Oonopidae and Amaurobiidae were more sensitive to environmental modifications. The differences in the spider communities were explained by the following soil properties: organic matter, mean weight-diameter of soil aggregates, and resistance to penetration, which were associated with the degree of anthropic intervention in the land use systems.

AB  - Efforts to reduce deforestation are increasing worldwide through the implementation of climate change mitigation schemes and have recently been promoted as one of the goals of the United Nations' 2015-2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Fire Regimes and the Demography of the Lizard Micrablepharus atticolus (Squamata, Gymnophthalmidae) in a Biodiversity Hotspot
T2  - SOUTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance caused by anthropogenic fires are increasingly affecting the biodiversity of fire-prone ecosystems worldwide. The Cerrado biodiversity hotspot suffers higher deforestation rates than Amazonia and concentrates most of the burned areas in South America. To support adequate fire-management decisions in Cerrado, knowledge on the effects of altered fire regimes upon its animal populations is necessary. Based on a long-term, large-scale fire experiment, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes on the demography of the gymnophthalmid Micrablepharus atticolus, an endemic lizard of the Cerrado. Because M. atticolus is more abundant in open habitats, we predicted that frequent burns should favor its populations. Over eight years, we conducted a mark-recapture study using pitfall trap arrays in five 10 ha plots of cerrado sensu stricto, subjected to prescribed burns. Using generalized linear mixed-models of time series data and an information theoretic approach to select demographic models, we describe the life history of M. atticolus and assess the response of apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment to burn regimes and climate variation. Micrablepharus atticolus has an annual life cycle, with complete annual population turnover; breeding takes place during the dry season, when activity is higher, and hatchlings appear in the wet season. Apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment increased in the short-run after the passage of fire in all experimental plots. In the long run, however, both fire-suppression and more severe fire regimes were seemingly detrimental, presumably by affecting microclimatic conditions and food availability. Short-term studies may not adequately describe the effects of fire on the demography of lizard populations. Adequate fire management is warranted for biodiversity conservation in Cerrado, both inside and outside protected areas, including a reduction in the frequency and severity of burns in open physiognomies and controlled, patch mosaic fires to prevent excessive fuel accumulation in denser physiognomies.

T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Can democratic processes favour conservation outcomes in the tropics? This study focuses on local viewpoints within a forested landscape of high conservation significance in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). Stakeholders received posters displaying results from a previous study; these posters emphasised local priorities and views regarding local biodiversity. We assess local attitudes to this information, and consider some implications. Knowledge of, and agreement with, poster content increased among villagers, townspeople and civil servants after they received posters. All respondents appreciated the posters and all supported some form of forest conservation. All respondents agreed that biodiversity conservation and local views are vital in land-use planning. All agreed that logging companies need to be better controlled, while 80% consider them a "major environmental threat". These results bolster our belief that involving communities is not only an ethically defensible way to achieve conservation outcomes, but also a pragmatic opportunity to do so.

TI  - Soil Quality Indicators in Peasant Agroecosystems in Paraíba State, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research Aims: Soil quality (SQ) is the basis for the Sustainability of Peasant Farming Systems (PFS). We hypothesized that different land uses modify soil quality through changes that can be analyzed by determining the Soil Quality Index (SQI).Methods: Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm layer in five subsystems of peasant agroecosystems located in the municipalities of Solanea (A), Casserengue (B), and Serraria (C). SQI was calculated using non-linear scoring, while a principal component analysis was performed using all data (bulk and particle density, total porosity, particle size, pH, macronutrients, and soil organic carbon) to determine a Minimum Data Set (MDS).Results: The MDS composed of P available, Ca+2, Al+3, sand, silt, H+Al, base saturation (BS%), and the aluminum saturation (AS%) indicate that these parameters can serve as indicators for soil quality assessment in peasant agroecosystems. Sand and silt are related to pedogenic processes and parent material, while the remaining indicators reflect management practices. Land conversion from forest to cropland decreased nutrient availability and soil organic matter in agroecosystems A (Arenosol) and B (Luvisol) and increased the cation exchange capacity in agroecosystem C (Lixisol).Conclusions: All agroecosystems showed low SQI values, highlighting the need to expand conservation practices in the studied agricultural subsystems, especially regarding the increase of soil organic matter. Our results contribute to improving the use and management of soils and the vulnerability assessment in peasant farming, an essential requirement for the sustainability of agroecosystems.Implications for Conservation: Our results also demonstrated that agroforestry practices can significantly increase soil quality and soil carbon sequestration, a viable alternative for maintaining organic matter in areas susceptible to degradation.

TI  - Soil carbon losses in conventional farming systems due to land-use change in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional farming systems reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in tropical regions, predisposing these soils to emit CO2 to the atmosphere. However, studies conducted worldwide have shown that the magnitude of these losses depends on the management practices adopted as well as climate and soil conditions; thus, accurately quantifying these SOC changes can be a major challenge. In this regard, the aim of this study was to derive specific SOC stock change factors for conventional farming systems in the semi-arid region of Brazil and to evaluate the impacts caused by the conventional systems of annual crops throughout time and soil profile on SOC stocks in this region. A total of 66 pairs of comparisons were used, and datasets were analyzed through a mixed linear model. Conventional systems with annual crops reduced the SOC stocks by 17, 13 and 4% for the 0-30, 0-50 and 0-100 cm soil layers, respectively, and for the period of 20 years of land use change. The SOC losses increased with the crop period, since the land-use change factors derived for 40 years showed a decrease of 26, 22 and 13% for the 0-30, 0-50, and 0-100 cm soil layers, respectively, when compared to the SOC stocks in native vegetation.

AB  - Losses of carbon (C) stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are challenges that scientists and policy makers have been facing in the recent past. Intensified agricultural practices lead to a reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks, mainly due to removal of aboveground biomass as harvest and loss of carbon as CO2 through burning and/or decomposition. Evidence is emerging that agroforestry systems are promising management practices to increase aboveground and soil C stocks and reduce soil degradation, as well as to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In the humid tropics, the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in vegetation can be over 70 Mg C ha(-1), and up to 25 Mg ha(-1) in the top 20 cm of soil. In degraded soils of the sub-humid tropics, improved fallow agroforestry practices have been found to increase top soil C stocks up to 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) above continuous maize cropping. Soil C accretion is linked to the structural development of the soil, in particular to increasing C in water stable aggregates (WSA). A review of agroforestry practices in the humid tropics showed that these systems were able to mitigate N2O and CO2 emissions from soils and increase the CH4 Sink strength compared to cropping systems. The increase in N2O and CO2 emissions after addition of legume residues in improved fallow systems in the sub-humid tropics indicates the importance of using lower quality organic inputs and increasing nutrient use efficiency to derive more direct and indirect benefits from the system. In summary, these examples provide evidence of several pathways by which agroforestry systems can increase C sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Patterns of fine root mass and distribution along a disturbance gradient in a tropical montane forest, Central Sulawesi (Indonesia)
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots < 2 mm until 50 cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding 'root gaps' in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia's remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.

TI  - Short-term changes in an ombrophilous atlantic forest
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing and monitoring the Brazilian Atlantic Domain provide important direction for the conservation of its remnants. Short-term variations in forest composition and structure are usually lost in larger intervals between inventories and could better elucidate forest dynamics. This study aimed to analyze temporal changes in the structure, floristic composition and diversity of a tree community of an Ombrophilous Dense Forest remnant in Bocaina de Minas, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in two short intervals. The study was conducted based on circumference at breast height (1.3 m) (CBH) data from three forest inventories (2009, 2011, and 2012) in twelve 400 m (2) permanent plots randomly distributed in the area. The results point out to a forest characterized by the increase in plant density and basal area, mainly due to the continuous local anthropogenic disturbances observed in the area, such as the presence of cattle and trails. These disturbances start early successional processes in various sectors of the forest. The altitudinal gradient leads to great environmental heterogeneity, resulting in a high species turnover, as well as high values of diversity which remained unchanged in the intervals considered.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in two Brazilian Cerrado soils under no-till
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A considerable proportion of the 200 million hectares of the Brazilian Cerrado is suitable for annual crops but little is known about the effects of tillage on the C dynamics of Cerrado soils. We evaluated the role of two representative Cerrado Oxisols (350 and 650 g clay kg(-1)) as sources or sinks of atmospheric C when managed under three tillage systems (conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT)) in 8- and 5-year long-term experiments. A literature review was also carried out and the mean C sequestration rates in no-till soils of tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil were calculated and compared with values for soils from temperate regions of the world. The original C stocks in 0-20 cm layer of soils under native Cerrado were higher in the clayey (54.0 Mg ha(-1)) than in the sandy clay loam soil (35.4 Mg ha(-1)), suggesting a higher physical stability of organic matter associated with variable clay minerals in the clayey Oxisol. The original C stocks of the native Cerrado soils appear not to have decreased after 23 years of conventional tillage in the sandy clay loam Oxisol, except when the soil had been subjected to erosion (15% loss of C), or after 25 years in the clayey Oxisol. Compared to conventionally tilled soil, the C stocks in no-till sandy clay loam Oxisol increased by 2.4 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and in the clayey Oxisol by 3.0 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.60 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The mean rate of C sequestration in the no-till Brazilian tropical soils was estimated to be 0.35 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), similar to the 0.34 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) reported for soils from temperate regions but lower than the 0.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) estimated for southern Brazilian subtropical soils. Considering the large area (about 70 million hectares) of the Cerrado which is currently used and potentially available for cropland, the adoption of no-till systems could turn the Cerrado soils into a significant sink for atmospheric C and contribute to the mitigation of global climate change.

TI  - Land sparing or sharing? Exploring livestock fodder options in combination with land use zoning and consequences for livelihoods and net carbon stocks using the FALLOW model
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock as an integral part of farming systems can increase resource use efficiency and land use intensity of agricultural systems, but can also be a driver of forest conversion and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Forest policies that limit land use options may be able to halt forest change, if strongly enforced, but concurrently may also reduce livestock carrying capacity. This study explored the use of the spatially explicit FALLOW model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name 'land-sparing' but de facto combined with 'land sharing' approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers' welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers' welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples' livelihoods and protecting environmental services.

TI  - Small seed bank in grasslands and tree plantations in former grassland sites in the South Brazilian highlands
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - The soil seed bank can be an important source for vegetation regeneration, and data on the similarity between aboveground vegetation and the seed bank can provide information about successional pathways after disturbances or land-use change. We conducted this study in natural grasslands in the subtropical highland region in southern Brazil. We evaluated the effect of silviculture on richness, density, and composition of the seed bank at former grassland sites converted to pine plantations 25 years ago. We worked at six grassland sites and three pine plantation sites and used the seedling emergence method. Seed bank density and richness in grasslands were lower than those reported in similar environments in other regions. Species richness and density varied considerably within each vegetation type; therefore, richness and density were not statistically significant, while composition varied among vegetation types. In terms of species, the pine plantation seed bank was a small subset of the grassland seed bank. Seeds of typical grassland species were missing in the pine plantation, but also had only low abundances in the grassland, and similarity of seed bank and vegetation were low (less than 20%). The low seed density found in this study, including in grasslands areas, indicates that regeneration of species from the soil seed bank likely is of a limited role for the maintenance of plant populations after disturbances in this system. Our data further suggest that natural regeneration after tree planting in grasslands is reduced due to seed limitation.in Portuguese is available with online material

TI  - Effects of natural forest and tree plantations on leaf-litter frog assemblages in Southern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anuran amphibians are extremely sensitive to changes in the environment and are severely threatened with extinction by human activities. The conversion of natural habitats to tree plantations is expanding in southern Brazil, emphasising the need for both scientists and society to understand the potential effects of this practice on animal communities. Here, we evaluated whether the richness, composition and abundance of leaf-litter frogs change among natural forests, plantations of the native Araucaria angustifolia and plantations of an introduced pine Pinus spp. We obtained data on the composition of the leaf-litter frog assemblages by sampling natural forest and tree plantations in the Passo Fundo National Forest, southern Brazil. We sampled leaf-litter frogs using pitfall trap arrays from March 2017 to February 2018. We used generalised linear mixed models to estimate the effect of habitat type on leaf-litter frogs while considering variation induced by season effect and spatial autocorrelation. We recorded 311 individual leaf-litter frogs belonging to nine species and five families. We did not find differences in species richness and composition, total abundance and abundance of the most frequent species Physalaemus cuvieri, P. carrizorum and Rhinella icterica among Pinus plantations, Araucaria angustifolia plantations and natural forests. These results indicate that tree plantations and natural forests can be equally suitable to leaf-litter frogs. Such suitability is promoted by the light levels of management exerted on these plantations, the old age of the plantations and the heterogeneous mosaic of habitat types maintained within this National Forest. Our study shows that some management decisions can preserve habitat quality to wildlife in modified landscapes.

TI  - Demographic effects of collecting rattan cane and their implications for sustainable harvesting
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rattan, Old World climbing palm, is an extremely valuable nontimber forest product whose canes are gathered for both market and nonmarket uses. I evaluated the effects, of harvesting commercial rattan, Calamus zollingeri Becc., on genet survival and ramet demography in two primary forest sites near Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia. I monitored 168 permanently marked C. zollingeri genets for 4 years and surveyed random transects for C. zollingeri genet and ramet populations and evidence of cane harvesting in 1996 and 2000. Cane harvesting had no significant effect on genet survival or mean ramet densities. However, current cane extraction rates significantly reduced mean cane lengths and total available cane throughout the study period. Based on observed genet and ramet populations and average cane growth rates area during the stud of 1.4 m/year, the sustained-yield harvesting potential of C. zollingeri is approximately 101 m and 56 m/ha/year in the two study sites. Although C. zollingeri exhibits life-history traits well suited to sustained-yield harvesting, including production of multiple canes, cane resprouting following harvest, rapid cane growth, and widespread abundance below 1100 m, current harvest rates exceed growth and yield, and supplies of cane are being depleted. Rattan harvesting is widespread in Lore Lindu National Park. Approximately 18% of the park (42,000 ha) is likely subject to intensive and unsustainable extraction of C. zollingeri.

TI  - Soil C and N stocks as affected by cropping systems and nitrogen fertilisation in a southern Brazil Acrisol managed under no-tillage for 17 years
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter is an ecosystem component with agronomic and environmental functions and is affected by soil management. The objectives of this study were to evaluate (i) soil organic C and N losses during a period of conventional cultivation (1969-1983) that followed on native grassland and (ii) the potential of four long-term (17 years) no-till cereal-and legume-based cropping systems (bare soil, oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)/maize (Zea mays L.), lablab (Lablab purpureum L. Sweet) + maize and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.)+maize) with different N fertilisation levels (0 and 180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) to increase the C and N stocks of a southern Brazilian Acrisol. Samples were taken from 0 to 107.5 cm depth, in 10 soil layers. The C content in the 0-17.5 cm layer of grassland decreased by 22% (8.6 Mg C ha(-1)) during the period of conventional cultivation. Meanwhile, N decreased by 14% (0.44 Mg N ha(-1)). Additional C and N losses occurred after the establishment of bare soil and oat/maize (no N). With N fertilisation, the C and N stocks of oat/maize were steady with time. Legume-based cropping systems (lablab + maize and pigeon pea + maize) increased C and N stocks due to the higher residue input. Although the major soil management effects were found in the 0-17.5 cm layer, up to 24% of the overall C losses and up to 63% of the gains of the whole 0-107.5 cm layer occurred below the 17.5 cm depth, reinforcing the importance of subsoil as a C source or sink. The average C sequestration rate of legume-based cropping systems (with N) was 0.83 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the top 0-17.5 cm layer and 1.42 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the whole 0-107.5 cm layer, indicating the remarkable potential of legume cover crops and N fertilisation under no-tillage to improve SOM stocks and thus, soil and environmental quality in humid subtropical regions.

TI  - Detecting ecological thresholds for biodiversity in tropical forests: Knowledge gaps and future directions
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Protecting tropical forests and their biological diversity is a global priority. Understanding if thresholds of forest cover exist beyond which biodiversity displays non-linear declines is key to developing appropriate conservation strategies and policies, but uncertainty remains around the identification and characteristics of these thresholds. We performed a global systematic review of studies using forest cover gradient to identify an ecological threshold across tropical forest ecosystems. Our systematic review finds 68 ecological thresholds reported in 33 peer-reviewed publications. Three main conclusions emerged: first, we show clear geographical gaps in ecological thresholds studies, with 72% of reported thresholds found in South America, over half in Brazil; second, we see ecological threshold studies follow taxonomic biases in line with wider conservation research; and third, there is a lack of homogeneity and comparability in the metrics and sampling designs used to identify a threshold. This global review shows interest in ecological thresholds continues to grow, but further evidence is needed to understand their application in tropical forest management. We identify the main gaps in knowledge and provide guidance to focus research efforts on six key aspects to better understand their potential as a policy-making tool for tropical forest conservation. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon in Forest and Other Land Use Types at Bengkulu City, Indonesia
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of natural forest into agricultural land uses has decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and increased carbon emission into the atmosphere, but proper management of agricultural land can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and increase the SOC This study was conducted to estimate the SOC content and storage in a forest, agroforestry land, oil palm plantation, and agricultural experimental field and to analyze the correlation between the SOC and other soil characteristics at Bengkulu City, Indonesia. Soil were sampled from the . following depths: 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm. The biomass of litter and ground cover was also sampled. This study found that the forest had the highest average SOC content from the three depths, and 0-30 cm depth SOC storage, while the agroforestry system had the lowest of both SOC content and storage. The 0-10 cm depth had the highest SOC content and storage, while the 20-30 cm depth had the lowest of both variables. The SOC was positively correlated with litter biomass, field capacity, exchangeable potassium, cation exchange capacity, and negatively correlated with bulk density and exchangeable calcium, but not correlated with total nitrogen and available phosphorus. High litter biomass input is the key to the maintenance of high SOC.

TI  - Global uses of Australian acacias - recent trends and future prospects
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim This study reports on the contribution of the Australian Tree Seed Centre (ATSC) to the international dissemination of Australian acacias. It also describes the current uses and the scale of economic benefits derived from planting Australian acacias, and speculates about possible future trends in usage. This information is crucial for the evaluation of overall human-mediated transfers of Australian acacias as a global experiment in biogeography.Location Australia and Global.Methods ATSC databases were used to determine which taxa were sent to which regions of the world and in what numbers. Location, scale and value of uses of the most important species were described from a review of published and grey literature, and we drew on our collective experience to speculate about future trends.Results The ATSC despatched samples of 322 taxa (or roughly a third of Acacia species native to Australia) between 1980 and 2010 to 149 countries. Plantations in SE Asia and South Africa supplying the pulp and paper industry cover an area of over 2 M ha and produce pulp worth around $US4.3B p.a. In SE Asia, pulpwood species also provide logs for an expanding industry based on solid wood product. Tannin is produced from Acacia mearnsii in South Africa and Brazil. A suite of multi-purpose species helps meeting the demand for food, fodder, fuelwood, poles and site amelioration in dry zone regions of Africa and elsewhere and are widely incorporated into agro-forestry systems. Acacia saligna is the most widely planted non-timber species with around 600,000 ha established worldwide. Many acacia species also have horticultural uses particularly in Europe.Main conclusions The ATSC has been the major agent for systematic exploration and worldwide dissemination of Australian acacias over the past 30 years, but seed from local and regional sources of exploited species will dominate future movements. The scale of production from currently planted species will expand to meet the demands of population growth, using improved varieties. Plantations for energy and carbon sequestration might become increasingly widespread.

TI  - Forest dynamics and carbon stocks in Rio Doce State Park - an Atlantic rainforest hotspot
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are significant biodiversity epicentres and work as important modulators of climatic change. In natural cycles, carbon stocks are regulated by vegetation dynamics through the rates of mortality, recruitment and turnover. This study was conducted in five permanent monitoring plots (1 ha each: total 5 ha) in the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP), the most continuous Atlantic Forest remaining in Minas Gerais, Brazil and considered one of the world's hotspots. The aboveground biomass ranged from 201 Mg/ha in the primary forest to 92 Mg/ha in the secondary forest. The recruitment rate (1.8) was higher than the mortality rate (1.1); however, the average diameter of dead trees was higher than that of the recruited trees. Notwithstanding this result, the internal diametric increment (ingrowth) in RDSP was compensated by the biomass loss of dead trees, producing positive growth in the annual biomass and increasing their carbon stocks by 1.0 Mg C/ha/yr. Interest in conservation and management of tropical forests has intensified since the 2007 IPCC results. Thus, our study provides data that will help calibrate the use of international methodologies in local projects using data previously collected with a standardized methodology.

TI  - Leakage and boosting effects in environmental governance: a framework for analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In an increasingly interconnected world, leakage-broadly understood as unintended displacement of impacts caused by an environmental policy intervention-has become a major governance concern. Yet, leakage remains both loosely conceptualized and poorly understood as a phenomenon in policy making. To fill this gap and broaden the leakage research agenda, we conduct a state-of-the-art review of scientific assessments on leakage (particularly on land use) and combine it with conceptual and analytical frameworks from the environmental governance literature. We then propose a rigorous definition of leakage, discuss frequently overlooked political dimensions, and develop a typology of leakage pathways. Our analysis of leakage through a governance lens yields five core insights: (1) Leakage is not simply a mechanistic phenomenon, but a complex governance issue involving questions of institutional fit, interactions, and political agency. (2) Although the land use literature traditionally focuses on leakage through markets or activity displacement, a governance lens shows that it also occurs through information, motivation, or institutional channels. (3) As policy-makers may act strategically, the unintentionally of leakage should not be assumed but rather become an object of research. (4) A phenomenon not initially regarded as leakage can come to be framed as such through the action of 'problem brokers' and changes in policy fields. (5) Policy-makers and researchers should broaden their focus from only avoiding leakage to seeking positive spillovers and institutional synergies. These insights are illustrated with examples from two cases relating to land use policy in Brazil and Southeast Asia.

TI  - Impact of native forest remnants and wild host plants on the abundance of the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus in Brazilian apple orchards
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Parana, southern Brazil, apple orchards are commonly bordered by highly biodiverse Atlantic Forest remnants. The main insect pest in these orchards is the highly polyphagous South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus. Technical advisers recommend that farmers remove wild host plants of A. fraterculus around orchards, which is at odds with the need for forest conservation. We thus investigated whether the presence of Atlantic Forest remnants and A. fraterculus host plants surrounding commercial apple orchards affect A. fraterculus populations in apple orchards in Parana, southern Brazil. For this purpose, we monitored A. fraterculus using McPhail traps in a total of 67 100 m x 200 m apple orchard plots that differed in their adjacent landscape (forest with A. fraterculus host plants, forest without host plants, open areas). In total, we captured 6412 Anastrepha fruit flies during four growing seasons. At the time when the apple fruits were susceptible to A. fraterculus, the probability of occurrence (i.e. of presence or absence) of A. fraterculus did not differ among the adjacent landscape types and was not affected by the presence of specific host plants. Its abundance in traps where at least one individual was found was also not affected. In contrast, at the time when the apple fruits were absent or not susceptible to A. fraterculus, A. fraterculus probability of occurrence was significantly higher in plots adjacent to open area than in plots adjacent to native forest remnants and intermediate in plots adjacent to native forest remnants with A. fraterculus host plants. At that time, its probability of occurrence and its abundance increased only with the presence of Psidium cattleyanum in these forest remnants. These results indicate that forest remnants had a limited impact on A. fraterculus abundance in orchards and do not support the recommendation to indiscriminately remove wild host plants adjacent to apple orchards.

TI  - Carbon Footprint Calculation of Net CO2 in Agroforestry and Agroindustry of Gayo Arabica Coffee, Indonesia
T2  - JORDAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere occurs as the result of various chemical, physical, and biological processes. The presence of CO2 around atmosphere greatly affects the agroforestry and agroindustry of coffee. This study aimed to describe the CO2 cycle in agroforestry and agroindustry of Gayo Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) and net CO2 ha(-1) of coffee plantation. CO2 cycle was analyzed based on the movement of CO2 around the agroforestry and agroindustry of coffee. CO2 cycle model describes net CO2, CO2 emission, CO2 reduction, and CO2 sequestration. Net CO2 ha(-1) of coffee plantation was 162.75 x 10(-2) t CO2 e ha(-1), with CO2 emission was 203.84 x 10(-2) t CO2 e ha(-1), CO2 reduction was 3.10 x 10(-2) t CO2 e ha(-1), and CO2 sequestration was 363.49 x 10(-2) t CO2 e ha(-1). This research formulates the calculation of equivalent carbon emissions in the arabica coffee production system in the field and primary processing, using various methods (remote sensing analysis and calculation of direct and indirect equivalent carbon emissions). The CO2 cycle positively impacts the sustainability of agroforestry and agroindustry of Gayo Arabica coffee.

TI  - Oil palm plantation systems are at a crossroads☆
T2  - OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS
M3  - Review
AB  - The future of most tropical sectors is clouded by growing constraints linked to, among many other parameters, climate change, price volatility and labour scarcity. Perpetuating agricultural systems inherited from the colonial era (a time of abundant arable land, protected markets, and cheap and disciplined labour) will not be enough to prepare these sectors in facing immediate crucial challenges unless substantial structural transformations are made.Implementing a successful agroecological transition in a 70-billion USD sector, covering 25 million ha worldwide, calls for drastic changes in mind-sets and practices. The key issue is no longer simply to increase productivity, but to foster innovations designed to support endangered tropical biodiversity, while providing a decent living for shrinking agricultural communities in the Global South.Agroforestry practices have a role to play in providing substantial climate change mitigation with an impact comparable to other climate-focused solutions, such as reforestation. The expected contribution of oil palm-based agroforestry relies on agro-environmental services, as basic agricultural functions such as soil preservation, pollination, or pest control can be ensured by living organisms inside and around the plantation. Diversified systems are able to achieve both economic and environmental gains, as they use land more efficiently than monocultures. Building on regenerative agriculture, new plantation designs are emerging and deserve to be thoroughly assessed to establish evidence-based advocacy for change.

AB  - Fire is a major environmental factor influencing vegetation heterogeneity, with closed forest and savanna ecosystems having different management needs due to their different responses to fire disturbance. However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics in an upland forest savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m(2) plots in closed forest, savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain, loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types. However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas. Understanding the longer-term vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management strategies for forest-savanna mosaics.

TI  - Comparison of benefits, stakeholders, implementation, and locations of community forestry in Taiwan and Indonesia based on experts' views
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the benefits, stakeholders, program implementation, and locations of community forestry (CF) programs in Taiwan and Indonesia based on expert views. An online survey was submitted to 49 experts between December 2019 and January 2020. We evaluated CF benefits, stakeholder roles, and available programs in both countries using the Friedman and Hollander-Wolfe tests. Concerning benefits, Taiwan and Indonesia differed considerably, in that environmental, economic, and social benefits of CF in Taiwan were all assigned equal values. However, in Indonesia, economic benefits (R = 55.0) had the highest score. Regarding stakeholders' contributions, community organizations (R = 99.5) constituted the highest contribution in Taiwan, while the government (R = 79.5) was the dominant stakeholder in Indonesia. The government mostly contributed by providing financial support (R = 67.5) for community organization development in Taiwan, while in Indonesia, it focused on devolving forestland and forest resources (R = 61.0) to communities. The contributions of non-governmental organizations in facilitating CF were the same in Taiwan and Indonesia. In terms of the available programs, Taiwan and Indonesia also differed, indicated by the community participation motives that were equally important to increase income, protect forests, and conserve biodiversity and ecosystem in Taiwan, whereas in Indonesia, increasing income (R = 63.0) was the most important to communities. For community development programs, ecotourism (R = 51.5) is more influential than product industry development in Taiwan, while in Indonesia, they were equally influential. CF implementation in Taiwan was more likely located in mountainous areas, while CFs were situated throughout Indonesia.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils via cultivation of cover crops - A meta-analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R-2 = 0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32 +/- 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in a mean soil depth of 22 cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7 +/- 1.5 Mg ha(-1) for a soil depth of 22 cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12 +/- 0.03 Pg Cyr(-1), which would compensate for 8% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global chocolate supply is limited by low pollination and high temperatures
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) provides livelihoods for 5 million smallholder farmers, but the factors limiting cocoa yield are poorly understood. We present a global analysis of pollination, cocoa tree, plantation, and climate factors affecting cocoa yield, with experimental data from three major cocoa-producing countries: Brazil, Ghana and Indonesia. Hand-pollination increased yield by 20%, showing cocoa yield is limited by pollination, but not nutrients. Leaf litter and large cacao trees, measures of soil resource availability and access, increased yield by 9-19%. Cooler temperatures by 7 degrees C during the hot season increased yield by up to 31%, indicating substantial risks from climate warming. Agricultural production that enhances cocoa pollinator abundance, protects soils, and mitigates climate risks will be the most effective way to secure global cocoa production and support livelihoods into the future.

TI  - The effects of different rice cultivation systems and ages on resting stages of wetland invertebrates in southern Brazil
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of machinery and pesticides in modern agriculture are supposed to negatively affect the viability and diversity of invertebrate egg banks. Studies that evaluate the emergence of invertebrates through analysis of their dormant stages are needed in order to identify the resiliency of food webs in wetlands. In this study, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) richness is lower in conventional rice fields than in organic ones and natural wetlands; (2) richness is lower in older rice fields than younger fields; (3) composition varies among different rice systems and ages; and (4) emergence rate may vary among rice systems and ages over time. Dry sediment samples were collected from six rice fields cultivated under different systems, nine conventional rice fields with different cultivation ages and three natural wetlands. Our study showed that the richness was surprisingly higher in conventional rice fields than wetlands, with cladocerans being more associated with the former and insects more frequent in the latter. Invertebrate richness was similar among rice fields of different ages, but the composition differed between 20-year-old fields and younger fields. Variation in the viable resting stages found across different rice cultivation systems and ages contributes valuable information to wetland restoration initiatives.

TI  - Fire shapes mammal abundance at the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone: Scale of effect, species traits and land-cover interaction
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical regions, which harbour the majority of the Earth's biodiversity, land-cover change emerges as the primary driver of biodiversity loss. However, despite the propensity for many tropical biomes to experience fires, and the rapidly accelerating pace of intensification in fire regimes, the role of fire in shaping ecological communities has largely been overlooked. We examined whether and how fire regime affected the abundance of mammal species, the scale at which these putative effects operated and how fire effect interacted with land cover. Using camera traps, we studied four mammal species with different ecological traits in the Kadiwe<acute accent>u indigenous territory, a Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. Specifically, we used abundance models to analyse the response of mammal species to fire frequency, spatial extent, and time since fire. Our results showed that mammals responded to fire at scales that align with the scale of responses to land cover. We found that the type of response to fire, and the scale at which fire effects operate, depended on species and possibly on their traits. The smallest species Sylvilagus brasiliensis demonstrated a clear response to fire, as well as to the mean patch area of savanna, exclusively at the smallest scale studied (i.e., within 500-m radius buffers). The abundance of this species decreased with increasing proportion of land burned in the 12 months preceding the monitoring. In contrast, larger species, including Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris, showed no response to fire, while Pecari tajacu would exhibit a marginal response, at the larger scale of 1000 m. Our results emphasize the importance of adopting trait-based approaches that consider the multiple aspects of fire regimes, at multiple scales, to disentangle the mechanisms governing the effects of fire on biodiversity. This should promote effective and sustainable fire management compatible with systemic conservation of species and ecological traits in fire-prone biomes.

TI  - Spatially explicit modeling of land use and land cover in the State of Rio de Janeiro-Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of the types of land use and land cover (LULC) can be one of the first requirements to monitor and evaluate the flow of environmental dynamics, due to the accelerated process of changes in terrestrial space, causing environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The region chosen for this study is an area of high biodiversity and has within its geographical limit the second largest city in the Southeast region of Brazil. The objective of this work was to parameterize a model of LULC, which comprises the State of Rio de Janeiro inserted in the Atlantic Forest Biome. For that, it was necessary to calibrate and validate the simulations, in the period between 2010 and 2016, respectively. The LuccME (Land Use and Cover Change Modeling Environmental) model was adopted, which identified the process of LULC changes, and made it possible to project future scenarios for 2020 and 2030, being optimistic and pessimistic. The study indicated the trend in pessimistic growth scenarios in areas that previously had forest in pastures and urban growth, with a low rate of native vegetation area. This is a warning for public and private sector management about territorial planning, for that in the future the population will suffer from the scarcity of natural resources. In the optimistic scenarios, the changes in vegetation are shows more intensely, since in the areas that were undergoing the process of restoration and reforestation, they recover to the point of changing from pasture to forest. In both scenarios, agriculture remained in the most productive and productive areas, with no significant increases or loss of area. Therefore, the use of this model allows the evaluate to have more consistent of environmental estimates, which can be used in different areas of knowledge.

TI  - Estimating state-wide biomass carbon stocks for a REDD plan in Acre, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As in many other developing countries, the state government of Acre, Brazil, is developing a program for compensating forest holders (such as communities of rubber tappers and indigenous peoples as well as small, medium and large private land holders) reducing their emission of atmospheric heat-trapping gases by not deforesting. We describe and then apply to Acre a method for estimating carbon stocks by land cover type. We then compare the results of our simple method, which is based on vegetation mapping and ground-based samples, with other more technically demanding methods based on remote sensing. We estimated total biomass carbon stocks by multiplying the measured above-ground biomass of trees >10 cm DBH in each of 18 forest types and published estimates for non-forest areas, as determined by measurement of 44 plots throughout the state (ranging from 1 to 10 ha each), by land-cover area estimated using a geographical information system. State-wide, we estimated average above-ground biomass in forested areas to be 246 +/- 90 Mg ha(-1); dense forest showed highest (322 +/- 20 Mg ha(-1)) and oligotrophic dwarf forest (campinarana) the lowest biomass (20 +/- 30 Mg ha(-1)). The two most widespread forest types in Acre, open canopy forests dominated by either palms and bamboo (for which ground-based data are scant), support an estimated 246 +/- 44 and 224 +/- 50 Mg ha(-1) of above-ground biomass, respectively. We calculate the total above-ground biomass of the 163,000 km(2) State of Acre to be 3.6 +/- 0.8 Pg (non-forest biomass included). This estimate is very similar to two others generated using much more technologically demanding methods, but all three methods, regardless of sophistication, suffer from lack of field data.

TI  - Agroforestry as a Biodiversity Conservation Tool in the Atlantic Forest? Motivations and Limitations for Small-Scale Farmers to Implement Agroforestry Systems in North-Eastern Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry practices support agricultural resilience against climatic variability, increase soil productivity, can diversify and increase farmers' incomes, and support native fauna in agricultural landscapes. However, many farmers are still reluctant to implement agroforestry practices. We distributed questionnaires to 75 agroforestry and 64 "conventional agriculture" small-scale farmers working in the northeastern region of the Atlantic Forest to identify the motivations and limitations to implement agroforestry practices. We reveal the four main reasons why farmers worked with agroforestry: Higher income generation (89%), diversification of the production system (86%), increase in the land's quality and productivity (86%), and increase in self-sufficiency (82%). The three most common mentioned reasons for conventional agriculture farmers to not shift to agroforestry practices were: Uncertainty if the system will work (62%), reduction in yield of the main agricultural crop (43%), and a lack of models and knowledge in the region (41%). Agroforestry in Brazil's Atlantic Forest region can support native fauna, but farmers need to be educated about agroforestry practices and encouraged to switch from conventional agriculture to agroforestry through an increase in available technical assistance and capacitation/training in agroforestry practices.

TI  - Sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) for livelihoods and biodiversity conservation in the orangutan habitat of Batang Toru, North Sumatra, Indonesia: mixed prospects for domestication
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestication of desirable forest resources in agroforestry is expected to contribute to community based forest conservation efforts, but there may be an optimum level of domestication in this respect. Aren or sugar palm (Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr.) is a multipurpose tree that provides livelihoods for local people and food for other biota in the landscape. However, its domestication is still limited in many places, such as in Batang Toru Forest Block, an area of high conservation value, including habitat for the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Options for aren management were prioritized as part of a landscape-scale conservation study by comparing domestication levels in the area. Data on economic indicators and ecological knowledge were gathered through interviews with key farmers, focus groups and transect walks. Four representative villages were selected for the study, that is, (i) two villages with no domestication of aren; and (ii) two villages with aren cultivation in rubber-based land-use systems. Costbenefit analyses suggested that in a rich biodiversity area, such as Batang Toru, although aren was one of the sources of local livelihoods, additional investment for domestication beyond cultivation was not an option considered by farmers. Farmers still perceived wildlife as an efficient mode of aren regeneration, supported by the coexistence of people and other biota in the area. It appears the value of aren for local people's livelihoods and conservation can be enhanced by increasing its stocking density. There is also scope for improving market access and share of end-user value received by farmers.

TI  - An experimental assessment of landscape configuration effects on frog and toad abundance and diversity in tropical agro-savannah landscapes of southeastern Brazil
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amphibians are an imperiled group of vertebrate animals that typically have biphasic life histories involving a shift from aquatic larval habitats to terrestrial adult habitats. Habitat loss is the greatest threat to amphibians and the importance of the spatial configuration of terrestrial and breeding habitats upon the landscape in determining amphibian persistence is poorly known. The information gap is particularly acute in tropical landscapes that simultaneously host the greatest and most imperiled amphibian fauna on Earth. We installed 125 artificial ponds at different distances from forest fragments embedded in an agricultural matrix in southeastern Brazil. Constructed ponds attracted 13 anuran species; ponds at the forest fragment-matrix transition hosted a greater abundance and higher species richness of frogs and toads than those installed either far from or well within forest fragments. Forest fragments larger than 70 ha in agricultural areas harbored more individuals than smaller fragments. Our results indicate that landscape configuration has an important influence on frog and toad distribution and abundance in tropical agricultural landscapes and we suggest guidelines for maintaining favorable configurations of aquatic and terrestrial habitats for conserving this rich and imperiled species suite.

TI  - Bat assemblage of Guaribas Biological Reserve, an Atlantic forest conservation unit in North-eastern Brazil: Results of a two-stage long-term survey
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Inventories are the basis of every work with biodiversity, with increased importance due to the current environmental crisis. Bats are one of the most diverse groups of mammals, with high ecologic versatility and are good bioindicators to monitor environmental impacts. We performed a two-stage survey at an Atlantic Forest reserve in the State of Paraiba, the first stage registering 187 individuals of 24 species and the second stage, 1073 individuals of 11 species; the second stage's richness being a subset of the first as pointed by the Mann-Whitney test. The second stage was more efficient in accumulating individuals, while the first accumulated species more efficiently. The diversity estimation (Chao 1) pointed that the survey was efficient in registering 93.75% of the species richness predicted for the area, and that diversity estimators are more reliable to evaluate sampling efficiency than methods based in number of captures. The inventory survey registered over 42% of the species richness registered for the State of Paraiba, as well as included a new register, Natalus stramineus, pointing that the bat richness for the state is yet to be sufficiently studied.

TI  - Assessing Dominant Production Systems in the Eastern Amazon Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agricultural frontiers in the Amazon region poses a significant threat to forest conservation and biodiversity persistence. This study focuses on Par & aacute; state, Brazil, aiming to identify and characterize the predominant production systems by combining remote sensing data and landscape structure metrics. A rule-based classification tree algorithm is applied to classify hexagonal cells based on land cover, deforestation patterns, and distance from dairy facilities. The results reveal three dominant production systems: Natural Region, Non-Intensive Beef, and Initial Front, with livestock production being prominent. The analysis indicates that there is a correlation between the productive area and deforestation, emphasizing the role of agriculture as a driver of forest loss. Moreover, road networks significantly influence production system spatial distribution, highlighting the importance of infrastructure in land use dynamics. The Shannon diversity index reveals that areas with production systems exhibit greater diversity in land use and land cover classes, reflecting a wider range of modifications. In contrast, natural vegetation areas show lower Shannon values, suggesting that these areas are more intact and are less affected by human activities. These findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable development policies that will mitigate threats to forest resilience and biodiversity in Par & aacute; state.

TI  - Food matters: Trophodynamics and the role of diet in the invasion success of Procambarus clarkii in an Atlantic Forest conservation area
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Procambarus clarkii is an important invasive freshwater species whose ecological plasticity allows for its establishment in different kinds of environments; such plasticity is also reflected in its diet with two main consequences: invasion success and impact on native biota. In order to investigate P. clarkii's feeding habits, examine how its diet varies both seasonally and among different demographic groups (reproductive males, non-reproductive males and females) and explore the two consequences mentioned above, we investigated the trophic role of this species in an Atlantic Forest conservation area in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil). A total of 540 specimens collected monthly over a year were measured and weighed. Their stomachs were weighed and classified according to the degree of stomach fullness. Stomach contents were examined, and animal and plant matter weighed. Food items were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and the percentage of occurrence of each item was calculated, as well as the diet diversity. Collected data were compared according to seasons and demographic groups through the Analysis of Similarity and Similarity Percentage Analysis. The percentage of animal weight attributed to stomach weight and the degree of fullness of stomachs did not vary significantly among seasons; however, non-reproductive males had significantly less full stomachs. Diet composition was evenly balanced between plant and animal material for both reproductive males and females, while non-reproductive males consumed a lower proportion of animal matter. The diversity in diet composition was high in all seasons and for all demographic groups, although always slightly lower for non-reproductive males. The percentage of occurrence of food items evidenced high consumption of algae and macrophytes throughout the year. It also reflected the seasonal variation of consumed prey, with a shift in consumption of insects and microcrustaceans in spring and summer to decapods and amphibians in fall and winter. The dissimilarity in diet composition was more pronounced among demographic groups than among seasons, being non-reproductive males the most different, with higher ingesting of less evasive prey. Nonetheless, winter differed from other seasons and was the season with least different food composition among demographic groups, indicating a homogenization in diet composition, which might be due to restricted availability of resources. Procambarus clarkii at Jaragua State Park demonstrated conspicuous dietary variability and flexibility. The occurrence of filled stomachs indicates that food resources are not a constriction for this population. The species presented a diversified and adaptable diet, foraging on algae and macrophytes, and preying on different vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Its trophic plasticity favors successful establishment in invaded areas and summed to its notable voracity, P. clarkii offers a wide, variable and significant interaction in food webs, being able to generate major impacts on native species by its feeding habits.

TI  - Testing the benefits of conservation set-asides for improved habitat connectivity in tropical agricultural landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for tropical biodiversity conservation. Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set-asides for forest connectivity. We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest-dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo. Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set-asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no-RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by similar to 3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by similar to 16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5-3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting). Future revisions to the RSPO's Principles and Criteria should also ensure that large (i.e. with a core area >2 km(2)) HCVAs are reconnected to continuous tracts of forest to maximize their connectivity benefits.

TI  - Total organic carbon and the humic fractions of the soil organic matter in silvopastoral system
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural production systems soil organic matter (SOM) is of paramount importance when assessing soil quality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the total organic carbon (TOC) and the humic fractions of the soil organic matter in silvopastoral system (SS) and to compare them with the conventional pasture system (CP) and a native vegetation area of Cerrado (NV). In the SS, soil samples were collected at distances 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 m from the eucalyptus row. Soil samples in each system were collected in the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers. The following parameters were determined: TOC, organic carbon associated with minerals (OCam), particulate organic carbon (OCp) and carbon of the humic soil substances. Carbon management index (CMI) and the sum of humic substances (SHs) were also calculated. SS was able to promote larger increases in the TOC, OCam and carbon stocks in the humic fractions when compared to CP and was also able to increase OCp and CMI values in depth. Soil sampling distances in the silvopastoral system had no significant influence on the changes in total carbon stocks and short-term SOM fractions. Furthermore, the land use with two years of SS implementation is not yet able to provide for most of the evaluated attributes with values equal to or higher than the soil with NV.

TI  - Research and conservation of biodiversity in Gunung Halimun National Park, west Java Indonesia.
T2  - Tropical Biodiversity
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive study was conducted in Gunung Halirnun National Park (GHNP) in west Java from April 1996 to January 1998 under a joint research project of the Indonesian Institute for Science (LIPI), the Ministry of Forestry, Directorate General Nature Preservation and Forest Conservation (PKA was PHPA), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) during a 3 year project from July 1995 to June 1998. A vegetation study focusing on altitudinal zonation ascertained that the forest in GHNP could be classified into 3 zones, 1) colline, 2) submontane forest, and 3) montane forest. Three I-ha permanent plots were established, two at Cikaniki at l.lOOm asl.and one on Gunung Botolat 1,700 masl. These plots contained a total of 116, 105 and 46 tree species respectively. At 5 other sites in GHNP, a botanical survey identified approximately 750 flowering plants species belonging to 266 genera and 93 families. Thirty- seven small mammal species were collected. This included 20 species of Chiroptera which were caught in traps or mist nets. A total of 34 bird species including 8 newly recorded ones that were not mentioned in previous reports, were recorded during a bird-banding study. Alist of 37 species of amphibian and reptile were systematically arranged, and consist of 16 frog, 12 lizard and 9 snake species (Sidik, 1998). Seventy- seven butterfly species were also identified. Species richness of trees, small mammals, birds, and butterflies decreased in the montane zone in comparison with the lower montane or colline zone in GHNP. Density of primates also decreased in the upland area. The results suggest that park management should pay more attention to the lower part of the national park from the viewpoint of biodiversity conservation. However, we have to also consider habitat preservation of the particular species and the fragile ecosystem in the upland area.

TI  - Recovery of biomass and merchantable timber volumes twenty years after conventional and reduced-impact logging in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns about the sustainability of tropical forestry motivated this study on post-logging timber and carbon dynamics over a 20-year period in Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Previously unlogged forest was subjected to conventional logging (CL), reduced-impact logging (RIL), or was set aside as an unlogged control. All trees >= 25 cm DBH and all trees of commercial species >= 10 cm DBH were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot in each treatment, with a 5.25 ha subplot in each for monitoring all trees >= 10 cm DBH. Above-ground biomass and bole volumes of merchantable species were tracked based on 10 inventories made between 1993 and 2014. Pre-logging biomass and bole volumes of commercial species were estimated as 237, 231, and 211 Mg ha(-1), and 78, 80, and 70 m(3) ha(-1), in the RIL, CL, and unlogged plots, respectively. One year after logging, biomass was reduced 14% by RIL and 24% by CL with corresponding merchantable species volume reductions of 21% and 31%. By 2014, biomass and bole volumes of commercial species had recovered 95% and 98% of their pre-logging stocks in the RIL plot but only 76% and 72% in the CL, plot, respectively; timber volumes from large trees (>= 50 cm DBH) were only recovered to 81% in the RIL plot and to 53% in the CL plot. Over the first twenty years after logging, average volume increments from commercial species were substantially higher in the RIL plot (0.72 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) than in the CL plot (0.08 m(3) ha(-1) 1 year). Recovery of both biomass and timber volumes were temporarily reversed between 2009 and 2014 due to a 4-fold increase in annual mortality rates in the RIL plot and a 5.5-fold increase in the CL plot (as well as a 3-fold increase in the control plot), all presumably related to the extreme drought of 2010. Our findings support the claim that use of RIL techniques accelerates rates of biomass and timber stock recovery after selective logging. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Earthworm species in no-tillage agroecosystems and native Atlantic forests in Western Parana, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthworm populations often increase with the adoption of no-tillage (NT) practices, but few studies have evaluated earthworm diversity in these agroecosystems. In the present study we assessed earthworm species richness in 40 sites under NT and six native Atlantic forest fragments in Western Parana, Southern Brazil. At each site earthworms were sampled quantitatively (n=5) and qualitatively (n=5), by handsorting soil monoliths (20 x 20 cm width x 20 cm depth), totaling 460 samples overall. Earthworms were killed and fixed in 96% ethanol, counted and identified. Overall, 18 species were found, in the families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Megascolecidae, Rhinodrilidae and Ocnerodrilidae, of which 10 were native and eight exotic. No-tillage agroecosystems had larger earthworm populations and higher species richness overall than native forests, although this was mainly due to colonization of these agricultural fields by exotic species. Mostly native species were found in the Atlantic forests, highlighting the importance of these habitats as refugia for native earthworm species conservation.

TI  - Evaluation of soil organic matter from integrated production systems using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural areas under integrated production systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), have the potential to sequestrate carbon (C) since both Soil Organic Matter (SOM) content and trees biomass increase thus mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture. Regarding soil aspects, the C content stands out as the main indicator, but the structural aspect of SOM is also relevant since it plays a key role in the chemical stability of C compounds and the soil lifetime of C compounds. Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) is an effective technique to evaluate the SOM humification index (HLIFS) from practically intact whole soil samples under different agricultural systems. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the SOM humification index in different integrated systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), Integrated Livestock-Forest System (LFS), Integrated Crop-Livestock System (CLS), and in references areas, such as Intensive Pasture (INT), Extensive Pasture (EXT) and Native Forest (NF). For this purpose, samples of Redyellow Latosol (Haplorthox by Soil taxonomy) from the experimental site located at Embrapa Pecu ' aria Sudeste (Southeast of Brazil) were collected five years after the establishment of the integrated systems. Samples were collected at soil depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. Pellets of the whole soil samples were prepared for LIFS analysis. In these areas, SOM humification indices (HLIFS) presented the following descending order: CLS > EXT > INT > LFS > CLFS > NF. Previous results have shown a greater soil organic carbon stock in these integrated production systems than in the NF area, suggesting C sequestration in agricultural soil. In the present study, SOM was classified by LIFS as more chemically stable in integrated production systems than in native vegetation. Higher amounts of fluorescent compounds were identified from LIFS data, probably resulting from condensed aromatic groups. SOM with more recalcitrant groups normally has a longer lifetime in the soil, indicating a long-term contribution to mitigating climate change by avoiding fast SOM decomposition and CO2 return to the atmosphere. Also, for the first time, this study was able to identify a positive correlation (R = 0.79) between the SOM humification index (HLIFS) and the Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)/C content ratio of whole soil samples, another innovative contribution from soil LIFS analyses.

TI  - Lime and gypsum application increases biological activity, carbon pools, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of lime and gypsum has been recognized as an important strategy for correcting soil acidity and for improving soil fertility, soil aggregation, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soils. We hypothesized that the combined application of lime and gypsum would create favorable conditions for biological activity and result in increased SOC storage and agronomic productivity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., 15 years) impact of lime and gypsum application on the biological activity, SOC stocks, and agronomic productivity of plots under no-till soil management. The experiment was established in 1998 at a site with clayey Oxisol in southern Brazil, and was designed with a split-plot arrangement, completely randomized blocks, and three replicates. The main plot was subject to three lime treatments: (i) control (no lime); (ii) incorporated lime (IL):incorporation of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1) to a depth of 0-20 cm by; and (iii) surface lime (SL): surface application of 4.5 Mg lime ha(-1), which was equally divided among three annual applications during the first three years of the experiment. The subplots were comprised by surface applications of gypsum at 0, 3, 6, or 9 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected in 1998, before of the experiment, and in October 2013, in order to evaluate soil enzyme activities, SOC pool stocks, crop productivity, C-biomass input, and soil fertility attributes. Both forms of lime application significant improved the stocks of several SOC pools, crop productivity, biomass-C input rates, soil fertility attributes, and enzyme activity. The SOC stocks were positively correlated with Ca2+ content and biomass-C input, demonstrating the potential of calcium to improve C accumulation. Enzyme activities were significantly affected by both soil fertility and SOC pools, with increases in hot water extractable organic C yielding the greatest increases in enzyme activity. In addition, we also found that gypsum application significantly increased the stocks of labile SOC pools and arylsulfatase activity. However, effects of gypsum application were less apparent than those of lime application and the combination of surface lime (4.5 Mg ha(-1)) and gypsum (9 Mg ha(-1)) application yielded the greatest long-term increase in the stock of total organic C stock. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that lime and gypsum application, along with no-till management and biomass-C input, constitutes an efficient strategy for improving the biological activity, C stocks, and productivity of agricultural soils.

TI  - Climate change could threaten cocoa production: Effects of 2015-16 El Nino-related drought on cocoa agroforests in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models predict a possible increase in the frequency of strong climate events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which in parts of the tropics are the cause of exceptional droughts, these threaten global food production. Agroforestry systems are often suggested as promising diversification options to increase farmers' resilience to extreme climatic events. In the Northeastern state of Bahia, where most Brazilian cocoa is grown in wildlife-friendly agroforests, ENSOs cause severe droughts which negatively affect forest and agriculture. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is described as being sensitive to drought but there are no field-studies of the effect of ENSO-related drought on adult cocoa trees in the America's; there is one study of an experimentally-imposed drought in Indonesia which resulted in 10 to 46% yield loss. In our study, in randomly chosen farms in Bahia, Brazil, we measured the effect of the 2015-16 severe ENSO, which caused an unprecedented drought in cocoa agroforests. We show that drought caused high cocoa tree mortality (15%) and severely decreased cocoa yield (89%); the drought also increased infection rate of the chronic fungal disease witches' broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa). Ours findings showed that Brazilian cocoa agroforests are at risk and that increasing frequency of strong droughts are likely to cause decreased cocoa yields in the coming decades. Furthermore, because cocoa, like many crops, is grown somewhat beyond its climatic limits, it and other crops could be the 'canaries in the coalmine' warning of forthcoming major drought effects on semi-natural and natural vegetation.

TI  - Physical fractionation of organic carbon in areas under different land uses in the Cerrado
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the expansion of agricultural production, native Cerrado areas are replaced with other forms of land use. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the physical fractionation of organic carbon (C) in areas under different forms of land use in the Cerrado. The treatments, with five repetitions, corresponded to the following forms of use: area under conventional tillage, area under pasture plantation, area under eucalyptus plantation and area under native Cerrado vegetation, at the depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm in the municipality of Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, BA, Brazil. The highest C contents and stocks were found in the eucalyptus area, which were equal to those of the area under native Cerrado vegetation, while particulate C stocks were higher in the area under pasture at the depth up to 10 cm, not differing from the area under native Cerrado. Pasture and eucalyptus had positive effect on C management index, regardless of depth.

TI  - Does deforestation promote or inhibit malaria transmission in the Amazon? A systematic literature review and critical appraisal of current evidence
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Considerable interest in the relationship between biodiversity and disease has recently captured the attention of the research community, with important public policy implications. In particular, malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However, despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use/land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia, contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns). In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru, and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

TI  - Effects of integrating legumes or trees on soil C stock and organic matter dynamics in tropical grasslands
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of integrated systems in livestock production has been implemented as a practice aimed at intensifying pasture area utilization while maintaining sustainable soil management to enhance total organic carbon (TOC) storage. However, the dynamics of organic carbon in the soil of integrated systems, involving the inclusion of legumes or tree components in pastures, are not fully understood. Our research assessed soils from pastures composed of grass-legume consortia (GLS), silvopastoral systems (SPS), and monoculture grass pastures (MP), comparing them to native forest soil (NF) in the Cerrado biome, at different evaluation depths: 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm. The objective was to evaluate the potential of each system to store carbon in the soil in contrast to native forest soil by determining the labile carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, carbon management index, and soil carbon stock. No differences were observed for TOC and soil carbon stock between GLS and SPS, but both were demonstrated to be lesser than in the NF soil (p < 0.05). SPS, MP, and NF did not differ in terms of labile carbon, water-soluble carbon, and microbial biomass carbon content (p > 0.05), while GLS did not show similarity to NF in any of the analyzed variables (p < 0.05). Only the SPS achieved a CMI >100 in all soil depth ranges evaluated. Our study demonstrated that the association among labile carbon fractions dynamics and the relationship between CMI and soil biological attributes can be used as a proxy for TOC dynamics and indicators of a production system's potential to sequester carbon in the soil. Collectively, the studied variables indicate that the silvopastoral system exhibited greater potential for carbon recovery compared to the grass-legume integration system or monoculture grass pasture.

TI  - Liming in the sugarcane burnt system and the green harvest practice affect soil bacterial community in northeastern So Paulo, Brazil
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we show that both liming the burnt sugarcane and the green harvest practice alter bacterial community structure, diversity and composition in sugarcane fields in northeastern So Paulo state, Brazil. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing were used to analyze changes in soil bacterial communities. The field experiment consisted of sugarcane-cultivated soils under different regimes: green sugarcane (GS), burnt sugarcane (BS), BS in soil amended with lime applied to increase soil pH (BSL), and native forest (NF) as control soil. The bacterial community structures revealed disparate patterns in sugarcane-cultivated soils and forest soil (R = 0.786, P = 0.002), and overlapping patterns were shown for the bacterial community structure among the different management regimes applied to sugarcane (R = 0.194, P = 0.002). The numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the libraries were 117, 185, 173 and 166 for NF, BS, BSL and GS, respectively. Sugarcane-cultivated soils revealed higher bacterial diversity than NF soil, with BS soil accounting for a higher richness of unique OTUs (101 unique OTUs) than NF soil (23 unique OTUs). Cluster analysis based on OTUs revealed similar bacterial communities in NF and GS soils, while the bacterial community from BS soil was most distinct from the others. Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla across the different soils with Acidobacteria Gp1 accounting for a higher abundance in NF and GS soils than burnt sugarcane-cultivated soils (BS and BSL). In turn, Acidobacteria Gp4 abundance was higher in BS soils than in other soils. These differential responses in soil bacterial community structure, diversity and composition can be associated with the agricultural management, mainly liming practices, and harvest methods in the sugarcane-cultivated soils, and they can be detected shortly after harvest.

TI  - Amazonian Anthrosols Support Similar Microbial Communities that Differ Distinctly from Those Extant in Adjacent, Unmodified Soils of the Same Mineralogy
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the microbial community composition in soils from the Brazilian Amazon with two contrasting histories; anthrosols and their adjacent non-anthrosol soils of the same mineralogy. The anthrosols, also known as the Amazonian Dark Earths or terra preta, were managed by the indigenous pre-Colombian Indians between 500 and 8,700 years before present and are characterized by unusually high cation exchange capacity, phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) contents, and soil carbon pools that contain a high proportion of incompletely combusted biomass as biochar or black carbon (BC). We sampled paired anthrosol and unmodified soils from four locations in the Manaus, Brazil, region that differed in their current land use and soil type. Community DNA was extracted from sampled soils and characterized by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNA bands of interest from Bacteria and Archaea DGGE gels were cloned and sequenced. In cluster analyses of the DNA fingerprints, microbial communities from the anthrosols grouped together regardless of current land use or soil type and were distinct from those in their respective, paired adjacent soils. For the Archaea, the anthrosol communities diverged from the adjacent soils by over 90%. A greater overall richness was observed for Bacteria sequences as compared with those of the Archaea. Most of the sequences obtained were novel and matched those in databases at less than 98% similarity. Several sequences obtained only from the anthrosols grouped at 93% similarity with the Verrucomicrobia, a genus commonly found in rice paddies in the tropics. Sequences closely related to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria sp. were recovered only from adjacent soil samples. Sequences related to Pseudomonas, Acidobacteria, and Flexibacter sp. were recovered from both anthrosols and adjacent soils. The strong similarities among the microbial communities present in the anthrosols for both the Bacteria and Archaea suggests that the microbial community composition in these soils is controlled more strongly by their historical soil management than by soil type or current land use. The anthrosols had consistently higher concentrations of incompletely combusted organic black carbon material (BC), higher soil pH, and higher concentrations of P and Ca compared to their respective adjacent soils. Such characteristics may help to explain the longevity and distinctiveness of the anthrosols in the Amazonian landscape and guide us in recreating soils with sustained high fertility in otherwise nutrient-poor soils in modern times.

TI  - A comparison of bird communities in natural and revegetated grasslands in south Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural grasslands are declining due to loss, fragmentation and degradation, resulting in the decline of grassland-associated bird species. The Pampas Biome in south Brazil is not exception to this worldwide trend, facing the expansion of croplands and afforestation with exotic tree plantations for cellulose production. To cope with the continuous degradation and loss of grasslands, restoration is an important conservation strategy, but basic information regarding the response of the fauna to restoration practices in southeastern South America grasslands is lacking. Here we compared the structure of bird communities in natural grasslands and revegetated grasslands after mining by planting native and exotic grasses. We sampled birds using 5-min point counts with unlimited radius in three replicates of each habitat (natural and revegetated grasslands; average size 22.2 +/- 2.3 ha). We also compared the vegetation density between the two habitat types. The structure of bird communities at natural and revegetated grasslands differed, with natural grasslands presenting higher species richness (42 vs. 35 species) and abundance (1459 vs. 839 records) than revegetated areas, and also a distinct species composition. Ten of the 11 grassland species that were associated to one of the two habitat types occurred more frequently in natural grasslands, which had higher vegetation density than revegetated areas. Even a decade after the beginning of the restoration process, revegetated areas did not resemble natural grasslands in bird species richness, abundance, and composition. These results differed from another study conducted in the Brazilian Pampas in which native plant species were used to actively restore a grassland. Therefore, until we have additional studies addressing the use of exotic grasses for the recovery of bird communities in South America grasslands, we encourage greater representation of native plant species in restoration projects.

AB  - In Indonesia, amount of biodiversity could be found including soil microorganism which were useful for sustainable agriculture. Everything lives in agricultural land were interacts and influences each others. Many factors of biotic and a-biotic environment such as land and climate fluctuation influences microbial expansion within the soils. For example arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) which was formed by myches (fungus) and root of higher plant maybe fluctuated in the expansion due to the soil tillage. Land management and the present higher plant affected its growth and expansion. Mycorrhizae spores as one of the important generative form of various species in the difference host plant. The implication of different host plant often close related to the soil management and properties. Soil sample that was collected from various host plant in the fields or bare land have been found varied spores. Andisols and its properties conserve higher organic matter relatively and developed in the cold temperature, therefore very suitable for AM expansion and also as natural resources stock of AM potentially.

AB  - Tarsius fuscus (tarsier) has a high potential to be developed as a tourism attraction at Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park (Babul NP). This study aims to identify challenges in developing sustainable tourism of Tarsius fuscus. Surveys, interviews, and documentation methods were employed in collecting data. Data were analyzed quantitatively and by using descriptive analysis, potential tourism analysis, internal factor and external factor evaluation analysis, and the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Babul NP has potential resources that can be used to enhance tourism, such as Tarsius fuscus that serves as the main attraction, its habitat' beautiful panorama, and local communities who can play a role in tourism. Nevertheless, the initiation and development of tarsier tourism face difficulties because infrastructure is limited, it is not a primary program of the management, tarsiers are not popular among tourists, and promotion is limited. It requires management effort and great advertising. It also needs to use all of the potency, especially using abandoned potency such as culture and tradition of the local community It opens the opportunity of tourists to involve actively (co-creation) in tourism. This strategy to initiate and develop this tourism will form a new model and innovation of tourism, namely Tarsius fuscus creative eco-tourism.

AB  - Burning of sugarcane residue after cutting is often practiced by sugarcane farmers in ratoon sugarcane. Burning of crop residue facilitates soil management in addition to land sanitation needs to avoid pests and diseases in the next planting season. However, until now very limited information on effects of burning the sugarcane residues on the diversity of Arthropods in sugarcane plantations in the next planting season. Ecological sampling was conducted in Pakis Village, Malang Regency, East Java Province from September 2015 to December 2016. The study used an area of 1 ha, divided into two each with 0.5 ha for land with sugar cane residues not burned and 0.5 ha for land with sugarcane residues burned as farmers practice. Arthropods were surveyed using pitfall traps, yellow pan trap, net traps, and malaise traps. Speciemens are brought in to the laboratory for sorting and identification. Shannon-Weaver index, evenness index, and dominance index (lambda) were calculated to evaluate burning treatment on Arthropod community. The results showed that the burning of sugarcane residue after cutting is able to reduce diversity (H '), decrease the evenness index (E) and increase the dominance index (lambda) of arthropods. Burning of sugarcane residues after cutting will have detrimental effects on ecosystem instability.

TI  - Long-term Impacts of Tillage and Cover Cropping on Soil Organic Carbon and Carbon Oxidizable Fractions in a Tropical Sandy Soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeA growing body of evidence has pointed out diverse factors limiting carbon (C) sequestration in soils under conservation tillage. This suggests the need for site-specific evaluations for better understanding agricultural practice effects and deployment of sustainable agriculture.MethodsWe used a long-term experiment (18 years) to explore 12 scenarios of corn production [conventional (CT), minimum (MT), and no-tillage (NT) combined with four cover crops] in a tropical sandy soil. The soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) and C-pools with different turnover rates (active and passive) were measured over 60 cm depth. C-pools were determined under a gradient of C-oxidation.ResultsIncrements in SOC stocks in MT and NT were observed up to 40 cm depth, but it relied upon the cover crop choice. NT resulted in higher increments in the active-C pool (23%), while MT increased both the active (26%) and passive-C pools (78%) at 0-40 cm depth compared to CT. Higher N stocks were observed in conservation tillage systems than CT. Cover cropping did not influence SOC pools in superficial layers of CT. Conversely, it dictated the maximum C accrual over the soil profile (60 cm) of MT (53.9 Mg C ha- 1) and NT (47.8 Mg C ha- 1) systems. The combination of MT and leguminous species resulted in increments of up to 6 Mg C ha- 1 in the active and passive-C pools when compared to CT.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that higher soil C and N storage downward tropical sandy soils profile can be achieved by a long-term combination of reduced soil disturbance and cover crop choice. MT has the ability to increase both labile-C and stable-C pools, thereby potentially promoting biological activity and acting as a longer-term C sink simultaneously.

TI  - Combined role of no-tillage and cropping systems in soil carbon stocks and stabilization
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in carbon (C) input and stabilization are key processes to turn soils into sinks of atmospheric CO2-C and help mitigating global warming. We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20 cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8 Mg ha(-1), P < 0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25 Mg ha(-1) in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18 Mg ha(-1) in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76 mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10 cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C. In NT, most of the C accumulation relative to CT occurred in the mineral-associated fraction, showing the importance of organo-mineral interaction in C stabilization and supporting our second hypothesis. However, the physical protection by aggregates played equally important role by stabilizing the occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) before it was further stabilized by organo-mineral interaction. No-tillage is recommended as a sustainable soil management, but to increase soil C accumulation, the potential of cropping systems such those based on legume cover crops must be concurrently explored.

TI  - Composition of bat assemblages (Mammalia: Chiroptera) in tropical riparian forests
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Various studies have focused on the richness and abundance of bats in tropical forests and how the composition of these forests affects bat assemblages, but there are few studies on the relationship of bats with riparian forests. The aim of this study was to ascertain the differences among bat assemblages of three riparian forest areas of the Tingua region, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. These areas were: I) an agricultural area (Takume); II) a reforested area in primary succession (Canavarro); and III) an area with late secondary vegetation (Tingua Biological Reserve). Assessments of bat species composition in these areas may shed light on how anthropogenic modifications in riparian forests can influence local bat assemblages. Bats were captured with mist nets during 72 sampling nights. Total bat abundance was 1,511 individuals in 26 species. The three areas differed in their species composition. The Tingua Biological Reserve was the richest area, Canavarro presented the lowest diversity and the highest abundance of individuals, and the evenness index was highest in Takume. The differences found in the composition and ecological indices indicate that bat assemblages have distinct characteristics in the three areas studied, with varied degrees of transformation and anthropization.

TI  - Frugivory by birds in a mosaic of seasonal semideciduous forest and a mixed reforested area in Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - (Frugivory by birds in a mosaic of seasonal semideciduous forest and a mixed reforested area in Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil). To support future forest recovery projects based on plant-animal interactions, this work aimed to evaluate the ornithochoric species and fruit consumption by birds in both a mosaic of seasonal semideciduous forest and a mixed reforested area in Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil. By monitoring and evaluating fruiting and frugivory events in focal and ad libitum sessions, 31 ornithochoric species were found that provide fruits to 38 species of frugivorous birds. In the mixed reforested area, 90.3% (n = 28) of the ornithochoric species had fruit throughout the year, while in the forest fragment this percentage was only 51.6% (n = 16), with higher temporal variations in the availability of the fruits; 65.2% (n = 1027) of fruits were consumed in the reforested area and 34.8% (n = 547) in the forest fragment. These results may be related to the smaller size of the forest fragment, which, proportionately, could determine a lower richness of plant species, and/or to the fact that abiotic dispersal tends to predominate in fragmented and disturbed sites. The mixed reforested area, although it has some exotic plant species, is ecologically more functional for birds and, due to its proximity to the fragment, apparently contributes to the maintenance of the resident and visiting bird communities of this region by providing food resources.

TI  - [Fire in marshes: evaluation of the impact on Odonata communities (Insecta).]
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - The marshes are open areas of Cerrado (brazilian savannas), which play an essential role in protecting water sources. Moreover, the marshes are also considered of great importance to direct use of rural people living in the Cerrado. These conflicts of use of the marshes are now a major challenge for biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to test the effect of fire on the richness and composition of Odonata (dragonflies) in burned and unburned marshes within the EstaYao Ecologica Serra Geral do Tocantins (EESGT). Species richness was estimated for each of the sampled marshes through non-parametric method of first order Jackknife. The analysis of indicator species was made by IndVal. The similarity in community composition of Odonata were obtained through the index of Chao. In total we sampled 33 species of Odonata, distributed among five families. No species of Odonata were associated specifically with burned or unburned environments. The marshes burned recently showed a greater similarity in community composition of Odonata than unburned marshes and the same pattern is evident when considering only the suborder Zygoptera. This work with Odonata communities has shown that there is impact of fire on species composition of the suborder Zygoptera which has less ability to disperse. This reinforces the idea that the fire is known to be one of the main threats to protected areas of the Cerrado and a threat to the biodiversity of EESGT marshes. If decisions of fire management are taken, it is crucial that it come together with research monitoring marshes in EESGT.

TI  - BIOCHAR: PYROGENIC CARBON FOR AGRICULTURAL USE - A CRITICAL REVIEW
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Review
AB  - Biochar (carbonized biomass for agricultural use) has been used worldwide as soil amendment and is a technology of particular interest for Brazil, since its "inspiration" is from the historical Terra Preta de Indios (Amazon Dark Earth), and also because Brazil is the world's largest charcoal producer, generating enormous residue quantities in form of fine charcoal and due to the availability of different residual biomasses, mainly from agroindustry (e.g., sugar-cane bagasse; wood and paper-mill wastes; residues from biofuel industries; sewage sludge etc), that can be used for biochar production, making Brazil a key actor in the international scenario in terms of biochar research and utilization). In the last decade, numerous studies on biochar have been carried out and now a vast literature, and excellent reviews, are available. The objective of this paper is therefore to deliver a critical review with some highlights on biochar research, rather than an exhaustive bibliographic review. To this end, some key points considered critical and relevant were selected and the pertinent literature "condensed", with a view to guide future research, rather than analyze trends of the past.

TI  - Changes in carbon storage in fallow forests in the tropical lowlands of Borneo
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The range of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from tropical land-use change has long been debated. A major source of uncertainty is attributable to the fluxes of CO2 due to changes in tropical land use. For example, estimate is different depending on whether the biomass or carbon content of tropical forests is totally lost by burning or recovered by regrowth. To estimate CO2 absorption by fallow forests after shifting cultivation, we investigated the floristic composition and measured the biomass of fallow forests in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Above-ground biomass of fallow forests were 8-10 t/ha at one-year-old stands and 45-56 t/ha at 10-12-year-old stands, regardless of the floristic composition. It seems reasonable to suppose that 7.4% of carbon released to the atmosphere by tropical rain forest destruction is reabsorbed and stored by fallow forests in Indonesia. If this is a universal trend in other tropical forests, a significant amount of CO2 is reabsorbed in fallow forests. We consider that fallow forests like the one studied here are substantial carbon sinks and help to offset the effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Teak plantation occupies 67% of plantation areas in Java-Indonesia; however, its impact on hydrological responses has not been studied in detail. Therefore, a study to assess the impact of teak areas on water yield and peak discharge was conducted in Blora, Central Java. Five catchments with different percentages of the mature teak plantation from 53% to 82% were chosen. Five stream water level recorders were installed at the outlet of the catchments to measure stream water level (SWL). The SWL data were converted into a discharge. Based on 2008 - 2018 data, the results showed that the lowest monthly (8 - 41 mm mo(-1)) and annual (140 - 445 mm yr(-1)) water yield were found in Modang catchment with teak areas (82%), and the highest monthly (41 - 107 mm mv) and annual (526 - 1,500 mm yr(-1)) water yield occurred in Kejalen catchment with teak areas (74%). Generally, all the catchments had the highest water yield in 2010 and the lowest in 2012. It was found that the broader the teak areas, the lower the peak discharge. Although the catchments with the highest (82%) teak areas produced less monthly and annual water yield compared to the catchments with less teak coverage, however, the catchments with high teak coverage can control peak discharge.

TI  - Managing grazing intensity to reduce the global warming potential in integrated crop-livestock systems under no-till agriculture
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34-98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1) on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. HighlightsOn-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs.

TI  - Assessing soil carbon storage rates under no-tillage: Comparing the synchronic and diachronic approaches
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-tillage (NT) practices with crop residue mulching are seen as an effective way to accumulate soil carbon (C). The rate of soil C accumulation can be determined by measuring soil C stocks over time (diachronic approach) or along a chronosequence that substitutes spatial history differences for time differences (synchronic approach). The objective of this communication is to compare the diachronic and synchronic approaches for determining the rates of soil C storage under NT in the Cerrado region of Brazil. In 2003 and 2007, soil C stocks (0-20 cm) were determined in three NT fields with 5, 9 and 17 years of NT adoption in 2007 (NT-5, NT-9 and NT-17, respectively), one conventionally tilled field (CT, 30 years of tillage in 2007) and one native Cerrado plot (CE) in Rio Verde (Goias state, Brazil). Soil C accumulation rates were calculated following both the synchronic and diachronic approach. Results from the synchronic approach showed that 30 years of cropping under CT depleted the soil C stock to 34.4 Mg C ha(-1), which is a decrease of about 27% of the original levels observed under the native vegetation (CE, 47.1 and 47.3 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in 2003 and 2007). Instead, NT adoption had been accumulating soil C through the evaluated years. Soil C stocks measured under NT areas in 2003 and 2007 were 29.9 and 31.3 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-5), 33.4 and 34.4 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-9) and 45.8 and 46.4 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-17), respectively. Much more moderate rates of soil C accumulation were observed diachronically (0.12-0.28 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) than with the synchronic approach (133 and 1.27 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in 2003 and 2007, respectively). Soil C stocks under CE between 2003 and 2007 (in the diachronic approach) did not change, indicating that diachronic measurements were accurate. Thus, it appears to be very difficult to eliminate all non-wanted sources of soil C variation (i.e. soil texture, land-use history) analysing the soil C accumulation in a chronosequence (synchronic approach). In spite of a time span of years between sampling dates, our results suggest the need for using the diachronic approach when assessing soil C changes under altering land-use or management patterns. Increasing the number of diachronic assessments may also help the parameterization of process-oriented models for exploring the effects of no-tillage systems on soil C storage rates more accurately.

T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is a tropical savanna hotspot that is impacted by frequent wildfires, but where many effects of fire still are poorly understood. This is especially true for the herbaceous strata at the community level, in which reproductive efforts are deeply affected by fire. The objectives of this study were the following: evaluate if fire qualitatively and/or quantitatively affects the production of sexual reproductive structures in an open cerrado community; describe fire-stimulated or fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species; and evaluate the influence of water availability on flowering and fruiting. The number of species with flowers and fruits/m(2) and the number of reproductive units/m(2) were sampled in eight 20x20 m(2) plots in Chapada Diamantina, Brazil. After the first sampling in the beginning of the rainy season (November 2009), the vegetation in four plots was burned and then the eight plots were resampled over five months. Indexes of fire-stimulated and fire-inhibited flowering and fruiting species were calculated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cross-correlation analyses were calculated and differences between the burnt and unburnt plots were compared with an analysis of variance. Sexual reproduction was deeply affected by fire, which changed the composition of reproducing species. Profuse reproduction of graminoids (Poaceae) and geophytic herbs classified as fire-stimulated flowering and/or firestimulated fruiting species concomitantly occurred with a high increase of water in the burnt soil compared to the unburnt soil in the first two months after the fires. The sexual reproduction of shrubby species was inhibited by fire. In an objective way, 21 species stimulated or inhibited by fire were recorded. Fire also changed the influence of rainfall on reproductive efforts. This study shows quick qualitative and quantitative effects of fire on open cerrado functioning and highlights the necessity of fire management for biodiversity conservation in savannas.

TI  - Dairy liquid manure and no-tillage: Physical and hydraulic properties and carbon stocks in a Cambisol of Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of liquid manure is often related to risks of nutrient losses by runoff and thus to the deleterious effects on water quality; but scarce is the information about the beneficial effects of liquid manure on soil physical conditions and its contribution in reducing runoff and nutrient losses in long-term, especially in no-tillage (NT) soils in tropics and subtropics. This study assessed the contributions of dairy liquid manure (DLM) on structural and hydraulic quality and on total organic carbon (TOC) stocks of a sandy clay loam Cambisol under NT, in Southern Brazil. The DLM was applied during 2 years, at rates of 0, 60, 120 and 180 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (DLM-0, DLM-60, DLM-120 and DLM-180, respectively). In the 0-5 cm layer, the application of DLM-180 decreased soil bulk density (1.32 to 1.17 Mg m(-3)), increased macroporosity (0.24 to 0.32 m(3) m(-3)), increased mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (1.59 to 1.94 mm), increased the larger macroaggregates (>4.00 mm), decreased the microaggregates (<0.25 mm) and increased nearly five times the saturated hydraulic conductivity (54 to 246 mm h(-1)), compared to unamended soil. Similar but smaller trends for those properties were observed in 5-10 cm, while no alterations occurred in 10-20 cm layer. Application of DLM increased the soil water sorptivity from 2.78 mm min(-0.5), in unamended soil, to 10.34 mm min(-0.5), in DLM-180-amended, and so the respective infiltration rate from 164 to 241 mm h(-1). The total annual C addition (crops plus manure) increased almost linearly from 5.5 to 10.5 Mg ha(-1) with increments in DLM rate, but increments in TOC stocks in the whole 0-20 cm layer were observed only between unamended (stock of 23.4 Mg C ha(-1)) and amended soils (average stock of 26.5 Mg C ha(-1)), and not among amended soils. In general, findings of structural and hydraulic improvements support the possibility of DLM application to diminish runoff and associated nutrient losses in coarse-textured NT soils in long-term, contributing thus to mitigation of water eutrophication problems. Additionally, the tendency for increments in TOC stocks due to DLM application might indicate a potential of this management practice into promoting C sequestration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term effects of continuous direct seeding mulch-based cropping systems on soil nitrogen supply in the Cerrado region of Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Cerrado region of Brazil conventional soybean monoculture is since the 1980s being replaced by direct seeding mulch-based cropping (DMC) with two crops per year and absence of tillage practices. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term impact of DMC on soil organic matter accumulation and nitrogen (N) mineralization. Measurements of soil organic carbon (C) content, soil total N content and soil N mineralization, both under laboratory conditions using disturbed soil samples and under field conditions using intact soil cores were conducted on a chronosequence of 2-, 6-, 9- and 14-year-old DMC fields (DMC-2, DMC-6, DMC-9 and DMC-14, respectively). The average increase of organic C in the 0-30 cm topsoil layer under DMC was 1.91 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Soil total N increased with 103 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (0-30 cm). The potential N mineralization rate under laboratory conditions (28 degrees C, 75% of soil moisture at field capacity) was 0.27, 0.28, 0.39 and 0.36 mg N kg soil(-1) stop day(-1) for, respectively, the DMC-2, DMC-6, DMC-9 and DMC-14 soils. The corresponding specific N mineralization rates were 0.16, 0.15, 0.22 and 0.17 mg N g Npt(-1) day(-1). There was no obvious explanation for the higher specific N mineralization rate of soils under DMC-9, given the similar soil conditions and land-use history before DMC was introduced. Results from the in situ N incubation experiments were in good agreement with those from the laboratory incubations. We estimated that soil N mineralization increases with about 2.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under DMC. The increase was mainly attributed to the larger soil total N content. These results indicate that even in the medium term (10 years), continuous DMC cropping has limited implications for N fertilization recommendations, since the extra soil N supply represents less than 20% of the common N fertilization dose for maize in the region.

TI  - The influence of land use systems on soil and surface litter fauna in the western region of Santa Catarina
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the abundance of soil and surface litter fauna in the western region of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, in the following land use systems (LUS): no-tillage crops (NT), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), pasture (PA), Eucalyptus plantation (EP) and native forest fragments (NF). Sampling was done in three counties in the western region of Santa Catarina: Xanxere, Chapeco and Sao Miguel do Oeste, in two seasons (winter and summer). The evaluation of soil/litter fauna in each LUS was performed by installing nine "pitfall traps" per sampling grid (3 x 3). The counties are true replicas. The soil for the chemical attributes was collected at the same sampling points for soil fauna. Altogether, 17 taxa were identified in the five LUS. The presence of groups of fauna was influenced by the type of soil management used. The LUS NF and EP provide better soil conditions for the development of a higher diversity of soil fauna groups compared to other LUS, which showed varying degrees of human intervention, regardless of the sampling season (winter or summer). However, annual crop systems NT and ICL groups showed greater richness and total abundance when compared to the perennial systems (EP and PA). Principal component analysis is an important tool in the study of biological indicators of sustainability because it allows use of soil attributes (chemical and physical) as explanatory environmental variables, which helps in the interpretation of ecological data.

AB  - Peatlands can be used for crop cultivation with various combination patterns both agroforestry and monoculture systems. Utilization of these lands not only produces high economic value products, but also contributes in providing environmental services, including carbon sequestration. This study aims to measure aboveground carbon stock of agroforestry and agricultural monoculture systems in Rasau Jaya, Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan Province. The agroforestry system observed is divided based on the level of peat depth, which are 0-2 m and 3-4 m. The pattern of agroforestry at a depth of 0-2 m is a combination of timber and non timber tree species and agricultural crops, while the pattern of agroforestry at a depth of 3-4 m is a combination of timber and non-timber tree species and plantation crops. Timber tree species are Pulai (Alstonia pneumatohara) and Gerunggang (Cratoxylon arborescens Bl); the non-timber tree species is jelutung (Dyera costulata); and plantation crop species are Jengkol (Archidendron pauciflorum) and Pinang (Areca catechu); and the agricultural crops are peanuts, cayenne pepper, tomatoes, bitter melon and eggplant. Observations were also conductedon the agricultural monoculture pattern, including the eggplant, chili, bitter melon and tomato. The components of measured carbon stocks are plant biomass (trees and lower plants), wooden necromasses, non-woody necromasses, and wild plant biomass. The measurement results show a shallow peat agroforestry system (0-2 m) with a combination of one year old trees and agricultural crops contributing to carbon stock of 0.8 tons/ha. Deep peat agroforestry systems (34 m) with a combination of timber trees, non-timber trees and plantation crops contribute to carbon stocks of 3 tons/ha. While the monoculture system of agricultural crops produce an average carbon stock of 1.1 tons/ha. Contribution of tree component in the agroforestry system are still relatively small, which is 2.6% of total carbon stock. However, it is estimated that the carbon stocks will continue to increase with increasing age.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Dynamics in the Brazilian Caatinga Dry Tropical Forest
T2  - CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing to determine land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics is often applied to assess the levels of natural forest conservation and monitor deforestation worldwide. This study examines the loss of native vegetation in the Campo Maior Complex (CMC), in the Brazilian Caatinga dry tropical forest, from 2016 to 2020, considering the temporal distribution of rainfall and discussing the trends and impacts of forest-degradation vectors. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is used to obtain the rainfall data from the CHIRPS collection and to create the LULC maps. The random forest classifier is used and applied to the Landsat 8 collection. The QGIS open software and its SPC plugin are used to visualize the LULC dynamics. The results show that the months from June to October have the lowest average rainfall, and that 2019 is the year with the highest number of consecutive rainy days below 5 mm. The LULC maps show that deforestation was higher in 2018, representing 20.19%. In 2020, the proportion of deforestation was the lowest (11.95%), while regeneration was the highest (20.33%). Thus, the characterization of the rainfall regime is essential for more accurate results in LULC maps across the seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF).

TI  - Birds from an Atlantic Forest remnant in southern Brazil under the influence of quarrying
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of our work was to survey the composition (richness and abundance) of birds in a forest remnant of the Atlantic Forest in Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, susceptible to the expansion of quarrying activities to support future analyzes of the environmental impacts. We recorded 142 bird species, distributed in 16 orders and 42 families. We propose that species richness shall not be affected by the expansion of quarrying into the remnant; however, we recorded that bird abundance was significantly lower near the forest edge than in the interior, especially of endemic, threatened and understory specialist species. Thus, if quarrying operation expands, we expect the bird abundance in adjacent forest remnants will be higher after species displacement, then will decrease over time as intra- and interspecific ecological relationships increase through competition for resources and territory. The size and quality of the remaining fragments are fundamental to reduce impacts of the activity and ensure the persistence of populations of sensitive and specialized birds in the region. For this reason, if the quarrying expands into the remnant area, then we propose that the surrounding forests be protected to ensure the migration and persistence of sensitive birds, mainly understory insectivores. In this context, we propose the following five actions to be implemented by the entrepreneur: 1) acquisition of surround remnants to be converted into Private Protected Areas, 2) reforestation equivalent to deforested area, 3) contribute to the National Action Plan for the Conservation of Atlantic Forest Birds through compensatory measures, 4) reduction of quarrying area, and 5) bird monitoring program.

TI  - Exploring Local Perspectives for Conservation Planning: A Case Study from a Remote Forest Community in Indonesian Papua
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconciling conservation and livelihoods is a concern wherever forests are important in local people's lives. We plead for engaging these people in survey activities to clarify what is important to them, as a first step in conservation planning. This will help to address their priorities and gain their guidance and support for interventions. This paper presents the results of such a survey with the community of Kwerba in Mamberamo, a remote and little known part of Indonesian Papua. Views and priorities were explored through interviews, scoring exercises, community mapping and a field survey. Whereas small gardens provided most staple food, culture and livelihoods were linked to the forest. People scored primary forest highest for nearly all use categories. Primary forest was particularly highly valued as a source of construction materials, ornaments and rituals, and as a hunting place. We developed a list of the overall most important plants and animals. Many natural resources were used, but few were commercially exploited. The community had rules to control access to certain areas and resources. Taboos to restrict access to sacred places were also maintained. Our evaluation identified opportunities to achieve conservation outcomes jointly with the Kwerba people. In follow-up activities, the community presented local government with a land-use plan for their territory. The government recognized the value of our approach and requested training to implement it more widely in the region.

AB  - Pepper foot rot is one of the most destructive diseases. There were three cropping patterns in the research area, i.e., agroforestry, pepper-cocoa and pepper monoculture patterns. As one of the most common cropping patterns, the observation of foot rots in the agroforestry pattern compared to other cropping patterns. The study was conducted in Simbune Village, East Kolaka Regency, Southeast Sulawesi, from October 2013 to September 2014. The research was conducted by direct observation methods. In each cropping pattern, a permanent measurement plot was made by sampling 30% of the total pepper individuals. The intensity of the disease was observed monthly for 12 months. The observation revealed that the intensity of foot rot disease was getting more severe toward the end of observation. The intensity on agroforestry (26% - 33%) and pepper-cocoa (17% - 35%) patterns were lower than that on pepper monoculture pattern (85% - 90%). The infection rate was lowest on the agroforestry pattern with a value of 0.051. This finding suggested that the agroforestry pattern for pepper showed the best resilience against foot rot disease.

TI  - Canopy recovery four years after logging: a management study in a southern brazilian secondary forest
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Understanding forest dynamics after logging is essential to define forest management cycles and intensities. In secondary forest, especially in the Atlantic Forest Domain, these studies are still scarce. Monitoring of the canopy structure after tree harvesting can be performed by hemispherical photographs, where canopy opening is commonly analyzed. This study evaluated changes in canopy opening four years after tree harvesting in a secondary Atlantic Rainforest in southern Brazil. We used hemispherical photographs to determine the Canopy Openness (CO), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Diffuse Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Absorbed Radiation (FAPAR(dif)) in eleven permanent plots.Results: We found that harvesting resulted in a momentary increase in canopy opening and light availability in the understory. Four years after harvesting, CO, LAI and FAPAR dif recovered or even exceeded the original values of the forest. We observed a significant correlation between CO and number of trees harvested with DBH > 30 cm. Weak correlations were found between these canopy related variables and the logging intensity.Conclusion: In conclusion, we recognized that changes of CO, LAI and FAPAR(dif) after timber harvesting presented short duration. This indicates that the applied logging intensities, 21.8 to 51.1% of the total basal area, did not exceed the resilience of the forest canopy and it's recovering four years later. However, additional studies should be carried out to observe vegetation dynamics, such as species composition, vertical structure, productivity and community stability, in order to improve management schemes of secondary stands in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Agroforestry system improves soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in depth after land-use changes in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have the potential to increase soil organic matter, with effects on soil carbon and nitrogen contents, but information on the application of these systems in semi-arid regions is still scarce. This study aimed to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in the conversion of native forest from the Caatinga Biome into integrated agriculture systems in the Brazilian semi-arid region. We evaluated the following management systems in the Haplic Inceptisol (Cambissolo Haplico eutrofico): (1) Intercropping area, cultivated with corn and Massai grass; (2) Caatinga (natural vegetation); (3) AFS10: agroforestry system with native woody forest rows occupying 33 % and agriculture occupying 66 % of the total area; and (4) AFS20: agroforestry system presenting inverse proportions of AFS10. The agroforestry systems were intercropped with sorghum or millet, pigeon pea and Massai grass. We collected disturbed and undisturbed soil samples at the layers of 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.40, 0.40-0.60 and 0.60-1.00 m for analysis of carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), soil bulk density, and calculation of SOC and N stocks and C/N ratio, two years after the conversion of natural vegetation to the agricultural area (intercropping) and agroforestry system (AFS10 and AFS20). We applied principal component and cluster analysis to explore the data, and confidence interval to compare the means of accumulated SOC and N stocks up to 1 m soil depth. No differences exist for the properties analysed in superficial layers (0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m), regardless of land-use systems. AFS20 increase the SOC content and, consequently, SOC stock, in subsurface layers; on the other hand, intercropping increases N content and N stock. AFS20 presented higher accumulated SOC stocks up to 1.00 m (114.97 Mg ha-1). Agroforestry systems management is an alternative for increasing carbon sequestration under the conversion from Caatinga to agricultural areas.

TI  - PRODUCTION AND FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY IN SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEM IN SMALL RURAL PROPERTY
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of silvopastoral systems (SPS) on properties that have family farming is an alternative to diversify land use, to acquire more than one production good, and diversify income generation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the financial viability and quantify the volume of the forest component in an SPS with a spacing of 3.0 m x 20.0 m for multiple uses, carried out at 4 years of age for a 16-year rotation. For the analysis of financial viability, we used project analysis criteria such as: net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for a 16-year horizon with rate benchmarks interest rate of 3%, 4.5% and 10%. Based on the financial analysis criteria, the tree component of the system is viable, as it presented an NPV greater than zero, IRR exceeding the minimum attractiveness rate and BCR greater than 1 for all rates analyzed. The estimated production of the forest component was 257.28 m(3)/ha in 16 years. Thus, it can be concluded that the forest component in the arrangement of 3.0 m x 20.0 m at 16 years of age, provides a financial return for the small rural property. Therefore, it is a system that brings several economic and environmental advantages, optimizing the use of land, diversifying the production of the small property, generating income, bringing benefits to the reduction of methane gas (CH4) emissions, and assists in carbon sequestration (CO2).

TI  - Physical protection of soil organic carbon through aggregates in different land use systems in the semi-arid region of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this work were to quantify the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and to evaluate the distribution of soil aggregates and their respective SOC and labile carbon (LC) present inside the aggregates in different perennial land use systems in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Soil samples were collected in four land use systems: two forage palm cultivation systems of different ages, a mango orchard, and natural forest. A higher amount of SOC stored in the 0-60 cm layer was observed in the mango orchard, increasing the soil carbon stock by 16.4% in relation to the natural forest. Palm cultivations presented larger amounts of macroaggregates from the 10-20 cm layer until 60 cm depth, while the mango orchard and natural forest presented a similar pattern in all fraction size classes. SOC averages of non-occluded particulate organic matter (POM) and aggregate occluded organic matter (AOM) in the macroaggregates of the 0-10 cm layer were higher in the mango orchard and natural forest compared to palm cultivations; however, the LC of AOM was higher in palm crops. Soil microaggregates were little influenced by land use systems, however this class represented an average of 24% of SOC stock.

TI  - An anticipatory life cycle assessment of the use of biochar from sugarcane residues as a greenhouse gas removal technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas removal technologies are needed to reach the targets of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. Among existing technologies, the use of biochar is considered promising, particularly biochar derived from the large quantities of sugarcane residues available in South America and elsewhere. However, the net greenhouse gas removal potential of sugarcane biochar has not been assessed hitherto. We use a scenario-based anticipatory life cycle assessment to investigate the emissions associated with a change from the combustion of sugarcane residues in a combined heat and power plant to the pyrolysis of these residues for biochar production and field application in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We define scenarios based on different mean marginal electricity production and biochar production share. The results indicate that emissions from covering the electricity deficit generated by partial combustion of biomass during biochar production is the main emitting process. Overall, the processes associated with biochar production lower the net greenhouse gas benefits of the biochar by around 25%. Our analysis suggests that allocating 100% of the available sugarcane residues to biochar production could sequester 6.3 +/- 0.5 t CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1) of sugarcane in Sao Paulo State. Scaled up to the entire State, the practice could lead to the removal of 23% of the total amount of GHGs emitted by the State in 2016.

TI  - The Forest Policies of ASEAN and Montreal Process: Comparing Highly and Weakly Formalized Regional Regimes
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are governed by a combination of sub-national and national as well as global and regional regimes. Comparing the institutional variation of regional regimes, including their degrees of formalization, is gaining attention of studies on regionalism in International Relations. This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montreal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements. Concerning the remedy for fragmented global forest governance arrangements, both regimes would be an example of practicing SFM-focused policies with the incorporation of forest-related policy elements into a larger governance assemblage dealing with issues such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation.

TI  - Soil carbon stock in balsa wood after fertilization strategies
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate whether balsa wood plantation and its fertilization can improve soil carbon stocks. Total carbon stocks in the soil-biomass system, at 0.0-0.30 m soil depths, were evaluated under three fertilization strategies, after three and seven years, and compared with carbon stocks from native forest and degraded pasture. At the highest fertilization level, balsa wood showed a carbon stock similar to that of the native forest (65.38 Mg ha(-1)) and, after seven years, it increased carbon stock by 18% in the soil, and by 42% in the soil-biomass system.

TI  - Managing forest plantation landscapes for water conservation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in water conservation yet forest plantations are considered detrimental because of their high water use. The current worldwide trends of reduction in natural forest and expansion of forest plantations increases the need for forest managers to contribute to water conservation, implementing management plans that integrate economic (productivity and growth), social (equity of access to water and land-use conflicts) and environmental (climate change and biodiversity impacts) factors. In this paper, we show examples of forest management alternatives at macro- and meso-scales that could contribute to improve water conservation in forest plantation landscapes. At the macroscale, we assess water use in different forest plantation areas in Brazil by analyzing the theoretical thresholds for the management of evapotranspiration. Then, using data from an experimental catchment, we modeled water yield reduction by a forest plantation over multiple years and assessed how different meso-scale forest plantation management alternatives affected water flow regulation. Results show that at a macroscale it is important to consider the natural climatic constraints of water availability. Evidence shows that forest plantations in the tropics use water according to its availability, and the appropriate choice of species/varieties and associated forest management options are crucial for water conservation. At the meso-scale we found that the proportion of native forest plays an important role in the reduction and regulation of water use, and therefore a system of mosaic management may be able to stabilize water flow across plantation landscapes.

TI  - Genetic diversity of rhizobia associated with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown under no-tillage and conventional systems in Southern Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is the largest producer and consumer of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), but yields are often low and may be improved by a higher N supply through symbiosis with rhizobia. One main limitation to the N-2-fixation process is the susceptibility of the symbiosis to environmental stresses frequent in the tropics, such as high soil temperatures and low soil moisture contents. Among other benefits, the no-tillage (NT) system reduces those stresses resulting in higher N, fixation rates and yields; however, the effects of NT on rhizobial diversity are poorly understood. This study evaluated the diversity of rhizobia compatible with common bean in cropping areas under the NT or the conventional tillage (CT) systems in Ponta Grossa, State of Parana, Southern Brazil. Genetic diversity was assessed by DNA analyses using the methodologies of BOX-PCR and RFLP-PCR of the 16S rDNA region. A high level of diversity was observed among the strains and the DNA profiles from the CT system were quite different from those from the NT system. Twenty-three RFLP-PCR profiles were obtained, indicating that many tropical rhizobial species remain to be described. Strain differentiation was achieved in the BOX-PCR analysis; diversity was slightly higher under the NT when compared with the CT system. Surprisingly, the rhizobial grouping based on cluster analysis of the RFLP-PCR of the 16S rDNA region indicated a higher diversity of species under the CT. It could be that the environmental stability offered by the NT system has led to a decrease in the number of species, with the predominance of the most successful ones, although genetic diversity within each species has increased. The results obtained in this study show that we still understand poorly the relation between microbial diversity and soil sustainability and that the complexity of the ecosystems require the evaluation of several parameters to define and monitor soil quality.

TI  - Edaphic fauna in soil profile after three decades of different soil management and cover crops in a subtropical region
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research evaluated the effects of long-term (30 years) winter cover crops under conventional farming system and no-tillage system on edaphic fauna in a Rhodic Hapludox soil, from Parana State, Brazil. We used three winter cover crops (black oat, hairy vetch and fallow), and as a reference a fragment of natural forest. Soil monoliths were collected at two times, one during the flowering of maize (April 2013) and the other during the flowering of soybean (January 2014). The extraction of the monoliths was carried out in three layers in the soil profile (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm). Seventeen taxonomic groups were sampled. The density of the edaphic fauna is inversely related to soil depth. The winter crops associated with the no-tillage system in long-term resulted in fauna densities similar to the natural environment, with a higher density (density increase of 2.2x) at a depth of 10-20 cm in areas with black oat. At 0-10 cm depth, black oat and vetch under no-tillage systems resulted in an increase of 62% and 69% (April 2013) and 46 and 44% (January 2014), respectively, in the density of soil fauna, when compared to the same winter crops in conventional farming system.

TI  - Lightning fires in a Brazilian Savanna National Park: Rethinking management strategies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire occurrences and their sources were monitored in Emas National Park, Brazil (17 degrees 49'-18 degrees 28'S; 52 degrees 39'-53 degrees 10'W) from June 1995 to May 1999. The extent of burned area and weather conditions were registered. Forty-five fires were recorded and mapped on a GIS during this study. Four fires occurred in the dry winter season (June-August; 7,942 ha burned), all caused by humans; 10 fires occurred in the seasonally transitional months (May and September) (33,386 ha burned); 31 fires occurred in the wet season, of which 30 were caused by lightning inside the park (29,326 ha burned), and one started outside the park (866 ha burned). Wet season lightning fires started in the open vegetation (wet field or grassy savanna) at a flat plateau, an area that showed significantly higher fire incidence. On average, winter fires burned larger areas and spread more quickly, compared to lightning fires, and fire suppression was necessary to extinguish them. Most lightning fires were patchy and extinguished primarily by rain. lightning fires in the wet season, previously considered unimportant episodes, were shown to be very frequent and probably represent the natural fire pattern in the region. Lightning fires should be regarded as ecologically beneficial, as they create natural barriers to the spread of winter fires. The present: lire management in the park is based on the burning of preventive firebreaks in the dry season and exclusion of any other fire. This policy does not take advantage of the beneficial effects of the natural lire regime and may in fact reduce biodiversity. The results presented here stress the need for reevaluating present policies and management procedures concerning fire in cerrado conservation areas.

TI  - Fine root production and decomposition of integrated plants under intensified farming systems in Brazil
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To ensure food security, foster agri-environmental sustainability, and prevent agricultural expansion into preserved areas, it is imperative to intensify plus diversify agriculture within integrated farming systems in the coming decades. Maximizing productivity and carbon sequestration through such systems demands understanding below-ground interactions and further research into plant root dynamics, which have often been neglected or overlooked. This study examined the effects of integrated farming systems, specifically crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, on fine-root dynamics of crops and pastures (i.e., herbaceous plants). Using an extensive grazing pasture as a control, and intensification through crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, we aimed to evaluate if integrated systems (i) enhance herbaceous root growth and necromass addition, and (ii) accelerate root turnover. We also investigated whether multiple linear regression modeling could predict root production and decomposition using the edaphoclimatic variables monitored in the areas. Herbaceous fine-root dynamics were observed over two years using the minirhizotron technique. Installation involved five 70 cm-deep acrylic tubes in extensive grazing and crop-livestock and fifteen in crop-livestock-forestry (1.9, 4.3, and 7.5m tree inter-row distances). In integrated systems, annual corn cropping was succeeded by grazing on a palisadegrass pasture. The trial measured eight additional soil and climatic parameters for a regression model using a stepwise selection procedure, including average soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, available soil water, soil bulk density, soil pH, available soil phosphorus, the sum of soil bases, and cation exchange capacity. Extensive grazing accumulated 124.8 m m(-2) of roots, constituting 48% of crop-livestock (259.7 m m(-2)) and 66% of crop-livestock-forestry (189.5 m m(-2)). Root growth near Eucalyptus trees was reduced by 51% compared to crop-livestock. Root turnover followed the order of extensive grazing < crop-livestock < crop-livestock-forestry. The peak daily root productivity was from 31 to 80 days of the crop cycle when corn was intercropped with palisade grass in the integrated systems. Multiple regression models were superior for predicting root decomposition, reaching adjusted R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.71 for crop and pasture cycles, but were ineffective for root growth (R-2 < 0.25). Therefore, additional parameters are needed to fit the root growth accurately. We conclude that integrated farming enhances fine-root production and root necromass accrual, accelerating root cycling compared to extensive pasture. However, as introducing Eucalyptus in crop-livestock impairs herbaceous root development near trees, we recommend adjusting tree density and inter-row spaces to alleviate these adverse effects, especially for annual crop cultivations.

TI  - Greenhouse gas balance and mitigation of pasture-based dairy production systems in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian cattle production is mostly carried out in pastures, and the need to mitigate the livestock's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its environmental footprint has become an important requirement. The adoption of well-suited breeds and the intensification of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimize the sector's land use. However, further research on tropical systems is necessary. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Holstein (HO) and Jersey-Holstein (JE x HO) crossbred cows in different levels of pasture intensification (continuous grazing system with low stocking rate-CLS; irrigated rotational grazing system with high stocking rate-RHS), and the interaction between these two factors on GHG mitigation. Twenty-four HO and 24 JE x HO crossbred dairy cows were used to evaluate the effect of two grazing systems on milk production and composition, soil GHG emissions, methane (CH4) emission, and soil carbon accumulation (0-100 cm). These variables were used to calculate carbon balance (CB), GHG emission intensity, the number of trees required to mitigate GHG emission, and the land-saving effect. The number of trees necessary to mitigate GHG emission was calculated, considering the C balance within the farm gate. The mitigation of GHG emissions comes from the annual growth rate and accumulation of C in eucalyptus trees' trunks. The CB of all systems and genotypes presented a deficit in carbon (C); there was no difference for genotypes, but RHS was more deficient than CLS (-4.99 to CLS and -28.72 to RHS ton CO2e..ha(-1).year(-1)). The deficit of C on GHG emission intensity was similar between genotypes and higher for RHS (-0.480 to RHS and -0.299 to CLS kg CO2e..kg FCPCmilk(-1)). Lower GHG removals (0.14 to CLS higher than 0.02 to RHS kg CO2e..kg FCPCmilk(-1)) had the greatest influence on the GHG emission intensity of milk production. The deficit number of trees to abatement emissions was higher to HO (-46.06 to HO and -38.37 trees/cow to JE x HO) and to RHS (-51.9 to RHS and -33.05 trees/cow to CLS). However, when the results are expressed per ton of FCPCmilk, there was a difference only between pasture management, requiring -6.34 tree. ton FCPCmilk(-1) for the RHS and -3.99 tree. ton FCPCmilk(-1) for the CLS system. The intensification of pastures resulted in higher milk production and land-saving effect of 2.7 ha. Due to the reservation of the pasture-based dairy systems in increasing soil C sequestration to offset the GHG emissions, especially enteric CH4, planting trees can be used as a mitigation strategy. Also, the land-save effect of intensification can contribute to the issue, since the area spared through the intensification in pasture management becomes available for reforestation with commercial trees.

TI  - EFFECTS OF URBAN SPRAWL ON FOREST CONSERVATION IN A METROPOLITAN WATER SOURCE AREA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The clearing of native vegetation in water source areas and its effects on water supply availability have become a major concern in large metropolises. This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land use and cover and their effects on the conservation of Atlantic Forest in a water source area in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo that is the second most densely populated territory in Brazil, the municipality of Diadema. Historical maps and trend scenarios were developed by applying the Markov chain in association with cellular automata. Forest conservation was assessed based on a set of landscape metrics of resource availability, fragment isolation, and trends of forest fragmentation. Our findings revealed an increase in urban growth of 37% in the last five decades directly associated to the clearing of 50% of forests in intermediate/advanced stages and 40% in early stages. The main drivers of landscape change were human-modified fields (41%) and net roads (54%). Optimal resource availability was drastically reduced (75%) while isolation increased (361.5%) among existing forest fragments. Therefore, future trends indicate that, without changes in the management of the area, deforestation may occur rapidly and continuously until 10% of forest remains, leading to potential adverse effects on water availability and quality of the Billings Reservoir and the local biodiversity.

TI  - Floral abundance and corolla length predict the importance of species in connecting urban green areas.
T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing urbanization rate and its consequences on biodiversity and species interactions worldwide, the connection among urban green areas, performed by interacting species, is still poorly understood. We evaluated how plant and hummingbird species vary across the urban landscape of a tropical city in Brazil, identifying traits of species taking part in shared interactions between areas. We recorded plant-hummingbird interactions in five green spaces and two remnants of native vegetation, and: (1) contrasted species traits and species-level indices of both plants and hummingbirds; (2) evaluated how species and interactions vary among pairs of areas; (3) used a meta -network approach to identify which pairs of interacting species are more important in connecting areas. Species turnover was the component that better explained the beta-diversity of interactions among sites. In green spaces, plant species presented greater centrality and longer corollas than in remnants. However, both plants and hummingbirds were similarly specialized regardless of the type of area. Trees with large floral displays and with longer corollas shared more interactions and were present in more networks. Most interactions recorded in remnants are unique to them, due to the exclusiveness of some hummingbirds and plant species in such native habitat and are, thus, more sensitive to habitat conversion. Our findings support the importance of preserving remnants and using mass flowering native species in urban afforestation to maintain plant-hummingbird interactions and promote urban biodiversity. We evidenced that few interactions (16.6%) were redundant across areas, indicating a highly susceptible and fragmented system in the urban space.

TI  - Soil conservation practices and greenhouse gases emissions in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGROPECUARIA
M3  - Review
AB  - In Brazil, more than 84% of N2O emissions and 74% of CH4 are produced by agriculture, and approximately 40% of the CO2 emitted originates from the use and change of land use and forest. It has been noticed a concern in several research institutions addressing this issue in order to improve the knowledge of the dynamics, as well as the main factors which drive the three main greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. In this sense, sustainable technologies that follow the conservation agriculture premises show potential to mitigate the GHG emissions, as the no-tillage system (NTS), the use of cover crops, the use of integrated systems and other edaphic practices. Regarding the NTS, the CO2 retention in soil organic matter justifies the positive balance in soils managed under this system compared to conventional tillage. Usually undisturbed soils act as sink of CH4, however, the management NTS and conventional tillage still need more studies in order to evaluate its effects in N2O production. How the soil is managed, strongly affects the gases emission and the carbon balance, showing that the adoption of soil conservation practices, aiming to soil protection, are essential to mitigate the GHG.

AB  - Pinus merkusii Jungh et de Vriese belongs to the pine species that grows naturally in Indonesia, particularly in Sumatra: Aceh, Tapanuli and Kerinci. The Perhutani has managed and developed P merkusii as a source for the state revenue. Wood and resin are the most important products of the P merkusii tree.The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of the tree growth based on its resin productivity and its characteristic flow pattern per unit time to support the completion of the project. This study was conducted at KPH Banyumas Barat in March-October 2018. The height and periphery of the trees were the data parameters for the growth evaluation. The resin productivity was evaluated for a year based on the characteristic flow pattern approach by using the drill tapping method on 201 sample trees which was repeated weekly. According to the statistical analysis, the tree's periphery has a positive effect on the resin productivity whereas the height has a negative one, which means that the cultivation of the pine tree is highly affected by the selected sylviculture. The research showed, by conducting a systematic measurement of the resin productivity of the 201 chosen trees reveals the existence of a good characteristic of resin pattern productivity in 10 individuals trees. The characteristic of resin productivity output pattern sequentially increased with a peak in May-August. This characteristic data is very useful for the Perhutani to optimize the cultivation of the entire P merkusii class for future endeavors.

TI  - Insights from a large-scale inventory in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - A key issue in large-area inventories is defining a suitable sampling design and the effort required to obtain reliable estimates of species richness and forest attributes, especially in species-diverse forests. To address this issue, data from 418 systematically distributed 0.4 ha plots were collected. Estimators of nonparametric species richness were employed to assess the floristic representativeness of data collected in three forest types in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The sampling sufficiency of forest attributes was evaluated as a function of sample size. Altogether, 831 tree/shrub species were recorded. The data acquired through the systematic sampling design were representative of both species richness and basal area. The confidence intervals' length would not substantially decrease by using more than 70 % of the reference sample (n = 364), thereby reaching a length of similar to 5 % of the sample mean. Nevertheless, reliable estimates of species richness for diverse forests demand a thorough sampling approach far more exacting so as to achieve acceptable population estimates of forest attributes. Though the study area is regarded as a biodiversity hotspot, the forest stands showed diminished species richness, basal area, stem volume and biomass when compared to old-growth stands. As regards species richness, the data provided evidence of contrasting great gamma-diversity (at the forest type level) and small alpha-diversity (at the forest stand level). Amongst anthropic impacts, illegal logging and extensive cattle grazing within stands are undoubtedly key factors that threaten forest conservation in the study area.

TI  - RECALCITRANT CARBON AND NITROGEN IN AGRICULTURE SOILS WITH RESIDUE ACCUMULATION AND FERTILIZATION UNDER TROPICAL CONDITIONS
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter has a strong relation to total organic carbon, and about 85% of organic carbon consists of humic substances (HS), classified as humin (HU), humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), and denominated as recalcitrant carbon in soil. HS are formed by complex, heterogeneous and polydisperse molecules, which have significant influence on the soil physical and chemical characteristics. The study evaluates the hypothesis that agricultural soils treated with organic residues may present higher carbon stocks as presented in forest soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate alterations in recalcitrant carbon and nitrogen stocks in Oxisol (Forest - FL, unfertilized Brachiaria - UB, and fertilized Brachiaria - FB) and Cambisol (Forest - FC, Coastcross - CC, sugarcane - CA, and silage corn - SM) at surface (0.0 - 0.1) and subsurface (0.1 - 0.2 m), in the Zona da Mata in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Result shows that fertilization, low soil disturbance and residual removal promoted increase of C and N content in HS, being close to native forests. Both, carbon and nitrogen recalcitrant, presented reduction with soil depth. HU ranged from 10.5 to 16.7 g kg(-1) and presented the highest concentration compared to FA and HA. In Oxisol, FL and FB presented the highest SH concentration and demonstrate the positive effect of fertilization on carbon stocks improving soil quality in well-managed and productive areas. While, In Cambisol, FC and CC presented higher carbon and nitrogen in HS, mainly for HU and HA fractions, and SM showed the lowest concentrations in all fractions. Our results suggest that soil managements with lower soil disturbance and residual removal promotes increasing of carbon and nitrogen in recalcitrant fraction, with concentration close to native forests. Pasture should be fertilized to improve recalcitrant carbon and nitrogen stocks, avoiding process of degradation in tropical soil. It is an important outcome due to high levels of degraded areas in Brazil caused by inadequate use of soil mainly with pasture.

TI  - Soil quality indicators in a Rhodic Paleudult under long term tillage systems
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many investigations have focused in defining soil quality indicator components. However, for understanding better the impact of soil tillage systems on soil quality, a broader approach is demanded, with simultaneous soil attributes evaluations, by using multivariate analysis. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the long-term effect of two tillage systems on the soil C and N stocks in comparison to those of native grassland and to identify the most suitable soil attributes for characterizing soil quality. The experiment was established in 1988 at the Agronomic Experimental Station of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Treatments consisted of two tillage systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and a reference area under native grassland. Soil analysis was performed up to 20 cm. Soil organic matter, C and N, physical fractionation was performed and carbon management index calculated. Microbial biomass C and N was determined as well as soil aggregate stability. From soil aggregation, soil average diameters and mass were grouped, and classes determined to calculate mean weight diameter. After 18 years, conventionally tilled soil showed lower total C and N stocks in comparison to no-tilled soil, which did not differ from native grassland soil. Soil C stocks ranged from 44.3 to 34.1 Mg ha(-1) for the native grassland and conventional tillage system and total nitrogen ranged from 5.2 to 4.1 Mg ha(-1) for the native grassland and no-tillage system, in the 020 cm layer. Among the tested soil quality indicators, the microbial biomass-C, total and particulate C stocks, particulate C and N stocks, and mean weight diameter were the indexes that best indicated soil tillage system effects, and they are therefore recommended for future use in evaluating soil quality.

TI  - Comparison among bacterial communities present in arenized and adjacent areas subjected to different soil management regimes
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this work were to characterize the soil bacterial communities in an arenized area in southern Brazil subjected to different management regimes through cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods and to evaluate the potential of selected plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria to improve the growth of native Lupinus albescens plants.Bulk soil samples from an arenized site and rhizospheric soil and roots of L. albescens grown in this arenized site as well as samples from soils of the same region outside of the arenized area and rhizospheric soil and roots of L. albescens grown in non-arenized sites were evaluated. Phosphate solubilization, indolic compound and siderophore production abilities of the isolates were screened and compared. Some isolates were selected for in vivo plant growth promotion in greenhouse experiment.The samples from the arenized area presented less microbial biomass and less diverse bacterial communities compared with those from non-arenized areas. The PGP characteristics produced by the bacterial isolates showed differences among arenized and non arenized areas. A growth chamber experiment with L. albescens showed that phosphate-insoluble conditions coupled with bacterial inoculation resulted in the best PGP effect.Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods showed converging results regarding diversity indices and the rhizospheric environments increased bacterial diversity and biomass when compared to bulk soils. The PGP traits analyzed in this work were affected by environmental conditions.

TI  - Protected areas within multifunctional landscapes: Squeezing out intermediate land use intensities in the tropics?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A protected area (PA) tends to be designated in an area where tracts of primary forest remain, often with poor accessibility due to terrain features and yet with some exposure to threats. Typically, a PA is at the start of a 'forest transition' gradient. The establishment of a PA influences the whole gradient. We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the PA and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of PAs increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a 'leakage' zone of influence of at least 10 km around a PA needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the PA and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

TI  - The effects of forest conversion on annual crops and pastures: Estimates of carbon emissions and plant species loss in a Brazilian Amazon colony
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The municipality of Theobroma in Rondonia, Brazil, covers 2165 km(2), of which 43% was deforested by 1993. Between 1973 and 1993, the national government continued to improve highway BR364 connecting the area to Brazil's south-central region and established a colony in Theobroma. During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha(-1) in the forest to 28 t ha(-1) in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and - given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture - improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation in cocoa production landscapes: an overview
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa agroforests that retain a floristically diverse and structurally complex shade canopy have the potential to harbour significant levels of biodiversity, yet few studies have documented the plant and animal species occurring within these systems or within landscapes dominated by cocoa production. In this special issue, we bring together nine studies from Latin America, Africa and Asia that document the contribution of cocoa agroforestry systems to biodiversity conservation, and explore how the design, management and location of these systems within the broader landscape influence their value as habitats, resources and biological corridors. Tree diversity within the cocoa production systems is variable, depending on management, cultural differences, location and farm history, among other factors. Animal diversity is typically highest in those cocoa agroforests that have high plant diversity, structurally complex canopies, and abundant surrounding forest cover. In general, both plant and animal diversity within cocoa agroforests is greater than those of other agricultural land uses, but lower than in the original forest habitat. There are several emerging threats to biodiversity conservation within cocoa production landscapes, including the loss of remaining forest cover, the simplification of cocoa shade canopies and the conversion of cocoa agroforestry systems to other agricultural land uses with lower biodiversity value. To counter these threats and conserve biodiversity over the long-term, land management should focus on conserving native forest habitat within cocoa production landscapes, maintaining or restoring floristically diverse and structurally complex shade canopies within cocoa agroforests, and retaining other types of on-farm tree cover to enhance landscape connectivity and habitat availability.

TI  - Analysis of cultivation of remaining forest fragments in the Moju River Basin, Legal Amazon, Para
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that Brazilian Amazon has been the target of changes in land use and cover caused by oil palm crop. Among other economically attractive species, they cause several impacts on the environment. One way to characterize environmental changes that have an influence on biodiversity conservation is the analysis of landscape metrics. The objective of this work was to characterize and to analyze, through landscape metrics, the remaining forest fragments in a landscape with palm oil cultivation, in the Moju River Hydrographic Basin under the perspective of the conservation of local biodiversity, making a comparative between the years of 2005 and 2017. The landscape analyzed is very fragmented, characterized by the presence of a large number of small fragments, demonstrating the strong impact of human activity in the area. The environmental compromise of the Moju River basin's landscape with respect to ecological integrity has become notorious, since over 50% of its dense vegetation area with up to 50 ha is composed of edge environment, a factor that significantly affects the quality of the existing ecosystems. Considering the context of the Moju River basin, strategic planning measures related to the control and management of the Moju River are necessary to contribute to the process of recovery and conservation of the remaining fragments.

TI  - The effects of management practices on soil organic carbon stocks of oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in global production of and demand for palm oil has resulted in large-scale expansion of oil palm monoculture in the world's tropical regions, particularly in Indonesia. This expansion has led to the conversion of carbon-rich land-use types to oil palm plantations with a range of negative environmental impacts, including loss of carbon from aboveground biomass and soil. Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in existing oil palm plantations is an important strategy to limit carbon losses. The aim of this study was to investigate SOC stocks of oil palm plantations under different management systems. Soil samples were collected from three different management systems (best management practices (BMP), current management practices typical of large plantations (CMP) and smallholder management practices (SHMP)) in north Sumatra, Indonesia. Plantations were divided into four management zones that were sampled separately with four replicate profiles in the weeded circle, frond stack, harvesting path and interrow zones. All the soil samples were collected from five (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-50 and 50-70 cm) soil depths. Soil samples were analysed for concentration of SOC, soil texture, soil bulk density and pH. Calculations of SOC stocks in the soils were undertaken according to the fixed-depth and equivalent soil mass approaches. Results showed that SOC stocks of plantations under BMP (68 t ha(-1)) were 31% and 18% higher than under CMP (57 t ha(-1)) and SHMP (46 t ha(-1)) respectively. In the BMP system, soils under the interrow zone that received enriched mulch and frond stack positions stored significantly more SOC than the harvesting path of the BMP system (77, 73 and 57 t ha(-1) respectively). BMP also had a 33% higher fresh fruit bunch yield compared to the SHMP system. This study shows that residue incorporation or retention as a part of BMP could be an effective strategy for increasing SOC stocks of oil palm plantations and confirms that these management practices could improve yields from SHMP systems.

TI  - Assessment of the Diverse Roles of Home Gardens and Their Sustainable Management for Livelihood Improvement in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Home garden is a traditional agroforestry system, which is an ecologically and socio-economically sustainable land use system in West Java, Indonesia. It plays a fundamental role in providing subsistence food and income to local people through a multi-strata structure. Despite the importance of the home garden, which is strongly linked with quality of living, there is still a lack of quantitative data and information. Therefore, we quantified the economic and ecological characteristics of home gardens in the present study to evaluate their diverse roles. In addition, general strategies that are applicable to home gardens in West Java were developed for sustainable management. The results of this study indicated that: (1) large landholding size showed a significantly higher Net Present Value (NPV) than small landholding size when the home gardens were dominated by fruit tree species, (2) species richness, species diversity, and carbon stock did not differ significantly among the different types and sizes of home gardens in West Java, and (3) multi-layered and diverse species composition is considerable for sustainable management of home gardens in terms of income generation and against urbanization and commercialization in West Java, Indonesia. Further studies should be considered for developing a standardized and generalized model that is able to evaluate and quantify the various ecosystem values that are generally acceptable and applicable in rural areas.

TI  - Disturbance or propagule pressure? Unravelling the drivers and mapping the intensity of invasion of free-ranging dogs across the Atlantic forest hotspot
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Identifying the drivers of biological invasions is crucial to predict the risk of invasion across broad spatial scales and to devise strategies to prevent invasion impacts. Here, we explore the relative importance and synergies between two key drivers-propagule pressure and landscape disturbance-in determining the invasion of native forest remnants by dogs, one of the most abundant, widely distributed, and harmful invasive species worldwide. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods Combining a camera trap dataset (96 sites in forest remnants) and censuses of populations of dogs raised by humans across 12 landscapes (2,830 ha each), we used N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection to confront alternative hypotheses of invasion drivers. We then used this empirical evidence to predict the intensity of dog invasion across the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Results Propagule pressure (density of raised dogs, positive effect) and landscape disturbance (forest cover, negative effect) were equally important drivers of dog invasion, presenting additive rather than synergistic effects. Dogs invade forest remnants far from their homes, making the density of raised dogs the key component of propagule pressure (relative to dog spatial distribution). Forest cover was more important than either the length or density of forest edges, suggesting that both reduced area of forested barriers to long-distance movements and increased proximity of forests to edges facilitate dog access to forests. Across the Atlantic Forest, the combination of high human population density and extensive deforestation makes dog invasion an additional and widespread threat. Main conclusion Combined with available maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, our spatial prediction of dog invasion can help target areas for integrated management actions. These actions should go beyond measures to control dog populations and encompass the maintenance and restoration of native forests and strategic planning of afforestation through planted forests.

TI  - The effect of fire on the structure of animal metacommunities in a Cerrado landscape: A 10-year survey of anurans, birds and moth assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the impact of a human-caused fire on four animal communities (birds, moths, and adults and larvae of anurans) within Emas National Park, Brazil, over a 10-year period. We compared community descriptors (mean abundance, species richness, and beta diversity) before and after the fire using an interrupted time series regression model. We found a significant impact of fire on the avian community, with all measured descriptors indicated a process of biotic homogenization, that is, a reduction in beta diversity, suggesting that sampled sites become more similar in species composition, and a decline in species richness that indicates dominance by a few bird species. Conversely, the fire's effect on moth and anuran communities appeared less pronounced, while the abundance and species richness in tadpole communities were increasing over time, different of the response of adult anuran communities, that randomly oscillated over time. At first, we expected that moths would be more vulnerable to fire than birds, since moths have lower dispersal ability than birds, with anuran communities less affected, although we were not able to identify the causes that make avian communities more vulnerable than the moth and anuran communities. We suggest that the lack of nearby refuges and larger home range requirements may be the key factors in understanding avian vulnerability to catastrophic fire events.

TI  - Current trends in forestry research of Latin-America: an editorial overview of the Special Issue
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mendoza city (Argentina) hosted the VIII Latin American Forestry Congress (CONFLAT) and the V Forestry Congress of Argentina (CFA) in 2023, where relevant issues were addressed, such as climate change, degradation, reforestation, management and forest industry, monitoring, environmental services, social issues, and governance, among others. The objective of this Special Issue was to present the main advances in Forestry Science for Latin-America in the context of changing governance and forest livelihoods for people. The fifteen articles emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the forest management and conservation, and that multiple variables must be considered to achieve sustainability. The articles come from studies across Southern South-America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay), and the collaboration of researchers of other countries (M & eacute;xico, Canada, and Spain). Articles include research in tropical, Mediterranean and temperate Sub-Antarctic forests. Together, these articles provide a snapshot of new forestry research carried out locally and internationally to bring about beneficial ecological and environmental outcomes in a world facing the challenges of sustainable management and conservation amongst the threats and uncertainty of climate change and environmental degradation responsible for extensive loss of biodiversity and environmental services. We believe that this Special Issue will encourage more inter-disciplinary research focusing on management and conservation of forests.

TI  - Earthworms in various agricultural and forest ecosystems in S?o Carlos-SP, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated agricultural systems have been greatly expanding in Brazil and currently cover over 30 million hectares. Although these land use systems help soil and environmental quality, little is known of their impacts on earthworm communities. In the present study we evaluated earthworm abundance, biomass and species richness in various integrated and conventional agricultural production systems (pasture, crops), as well as native forest and Eucalyptus plantations. The research was carried out at Fazenda Canchim (Embrapa Livestock Southeast) and at the neighboring campus of the University de Sao Carlos (UFSCar), in Sao Carlos municipality in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Two earthworm sampling methods, i.e., quantitative (25 x 25 x 20 cm deep monoliths) and qualitative (holes of similar size and niche sampling), were used in three integrated production systems, three conventional systems and two forest systems, totaling 232 quantitative samples and over 160 qualitative samples. Earthworms were counted and identified using available keys. Eight earthworm species of five families (Rhinodrilidae, Ocnerodrilidae, Megascolecidae, Benhamiidae and Glossoscolecidae) were found, with most of the 2,145 individuals being exotic or peregrine species, particularly Pontoscolex corethrurus (88% of total) and various Dichogaster spp. (8% of total). Two native species were encountered in low abundance (55 individuals), both of which are new to science (Fimoscolex n.sp.7 and Glossoscolex n.sp.9) and must still be formally described. The new species were found in the agricultural systems, but not in the native forest and the Eucalyptus plantation, where P. corethrurus and Megascolecids predominated. One unidentified Ocnerodrilid sp. was found only in the intensive pasture. Species richness was highest in the intensive pasture (7 spp.), followed by the agrosilvopastoral and agropastoral systems, highlighting the importance of integrated and pastoral systems in preserving earthworm richness and native species.

TI  - Influence of land use (savanna, pasture, Eucalyptus plantations) on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, most Eucalyptus stands have been planted on Cerrado (shrubby savanna) or on Cerrado converted into pasture. Case studies are needed to assess the effect of such land use changes on soil fertility and C sequestration. In this study, the influence of Cerrado land development (pasture and Eucalyptus plantations) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) stocks were quantified in southern Brazil. Two contrasted silvicultural practices were also compared: 60 years of short-rotation silviculture (EUCSR) versus 60 years of continuous growth (EUCHF). C and N soil concentrations and bulk densities were measured and modelled for each vegetation type, and SOC and SON stocks were calculated down to a depth of 1 m by a continuous function.Changes in SOC and SON stocks mainly occurred in the forest floor (no litter in pasture and up to 0.87 kg C m(-2) and 0.01 kg N m(-2) in EUCSR) and upper soil horizons. C and N stocks and their confidence intervals were greatly influenced by the methodology used to compute these layers. C/N ratio and C-13 analysis showed that down to a depth of 30 cm, the Cerrado organic matter was replaced by organic matter from newly introduced vegetation by as much as 75-100% for pasture and about 50% for EUCHF, poorer in N for Eucalyptus stands (C/N larger than 18 for Eucalyptus stands). Under pasture, 0-30 cm SON stocks (0.25 kg N m(-2)) were between 10 and 20% greater than those of the Cerrado (0.21 kg N m(-2)), partly due to soil compaction (limit bulk density at soil surface from 1.23 for the Cerrado to 1.34 for pasture). Land development on the Cerrado increased SOC stocks in the 0-30 cm layer by between 15 and 25% (from 2.99 (Cerrado) to 3.86 (EUCSR) kg C m(-2)). When including litter layers, total 0-30 cm carbon stocks increased by 35% for EUCHF (4.50 kg C m(-2)) and 53% for EUCSR (5.08 kg C m(-2)), compared with the Cerrado (3.28 kg C m(-2)), independently of soil compaction.

TI  - How much land is available for sustainable palm oil?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current consumption of palm oil accounts for one third of the growing world demand for vegetable oil. Amidst the burgeoning industry, huge ecological costs have been accrued within just three decades due to the rapid oil palm expansion in many parts of the world. Many oil palm plantations are linked to deforestation, biodiversity losses, land use change emissions, among other ecological problems. Total replacement of palm oil could result in even greater adverse environmental consequences as alternative crops will require more land. To satisfy the growing demands in a sustainable manner, any new plantations must be located in environmentally-benign lands. This study identifies and quantifies the potentially available lands in Malaysia and Indonesia through a novel fuzzy GIS-based land suitability analysis. Three maps were generated: biophysically suitable land, based on optimal conditions for oil palm cultivation, excluding peatlands and existing protected areas; environmentally suitable land, further excluding forest cover; and potentially available land, further excluding existing plantations and other land uses. About 4.5 million hectares of available land for new plantations have been identified that could provide 1.3 million tonnes per year of sustainable palm oil. However, most of these areas are fragmented and scattered throughout the entire archipelago, which could pose economic and socio-political hurdles to developers of sustainable palm oil. With affordable and fairer certification schemes, sustainable oil palm plantations can be achieved by smallholders on these potentially available lands. Yield improvement and biodiversity restoration of existing plantations should be the focus through revitalised sustainable agriculture and strategic forest conservation policies, respectively. The maps provide valuable policy insights into the possibility of future sustainable oil palm plantations and a starting point for on-the-ground assessment and further verification.

TI  - Fine-scale spatial genetic structure of Dalbergia nigra (Fabaceae), a threatened and endemic tree of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and considered a hotspot of biodiversity conservation. Dalbergia nigra (Fabaceae) is a tree endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and has become threatened due to overexploitation of its valuable timber. In the present study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure of D. nigra in an area of primary forest of a large reserve. All adult individuals (N= 112) were sampled in a 9.3 ha plot, and genotyped for nnicrosatellite loci. Our results indicated high diversity with a mean of 8.6 alleles per locus, and expected heterozygosity equal to 0.74. The co-ancestry coefficients were significant for distances among trees up to 80 m. The Sp value was equal to 0.017 and indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances ranged from 89 to 144 m. No strong evidence of bottleneck or effects of human-disturbance was found. This study highlights that long-term efforts to protect a large area of Atlantic Forest have been effective towards maintaining the genetic diversity of D. nigra. The results of this study are important towards providing a guide for seed collection for ex-situ conservation and reforestation programmes of this threatened species.

TI  - Booming markets for Moroccan argan oil appear to benefit some rural households while threatening the endemic argan forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. High-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. Nongovernmental organizations, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives aggressively promote the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting local people and the health of the argan forest. This paper tests some of these win-win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls. Our normalized difference vegetation index analysis, however, suggests that booming argan prices have not improved the forest and may have even induced degradation. We conclude by exploring the dynamic interactions between argan markets, local institutions, rural household welfare, and forest conservation and sustainability.

TI  - Potential of carbon accumulation in no-till soils with intensive use and cover crops in southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd USDA Symposium on Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry
CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - The area under no-till (NT) in Brazil reached 22 million ha in 20042005, of which approximately 45% was located in the southern states. From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, this region was a source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to decrease of soil carbon (C) stocks and high consumption of fuel by intensive tillage. Since then, NT has partially restored the soil C lost and reduced the consumption of fossil fuels. To assess the potential of C accumulation in NT soils, four longterm experiments (7-19 yr) in subtropical soils (Paleudult, Paleudalf, and Hapludox) varying in soil texture (87-760 g kg(-1) of clay) in agroecologic southern Brazil zones (central region, northwest basaltic plateau in Rio Grande Sul, and west basaltic plateau in Santa Catarina) and with different cropping systems (soybean and maize) were investigated. The lability of soil organic matter (SOM) was calculated as the ratio of total organic carbon (TOC) to particulate organic carbon (POC), and the role of physical protection on stability of SOM was evaluated. In general, TOC and POC stocks in native grass correlated closely with clay content. Conversely, there was no clear effect of soil texture on C accumulation rates in NT soils, which ranged from 0.12 to 0.59 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). The C accumulation was higher in NT than in conventional-till (CT) soils. The legume cover crops pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp] and velvet beans (Stizolobium cinereum Piper & Tracy) in NT maize cropping systems had the highest C accumulation rates (0.38-0.59 Mg ba(-1) yr(-1)). The intensive cropping systems also were effective 1 in increasing the C accumulation rates in NT soils (0.25-0.34 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) when compared to the double-crop system used by farmers. These results stress the role of N fixation in improving the tropical and subtropical cropping systems. The physical protection of SOM within soil aggregates was an important mechanism of C accumulation in the sandy clay loam Paleudult under NT. The cropping system and NT effects on C stocks were attributed to an increase in the lability of SOM, as evidenced by the higher POC to TOC ratio, which is very important to C and energy flux through the soil.

TI  - Characterization and carbon storage of agroforestry systems in brazilian savannas of Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems (SAFs) as well as income generation and biodiversity conservation can be an alternative to carbon stocks. The study aimed to characterize and estimate the soil and plant carbon stocks of SAFs in Brazilian savannas of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Three agroforestry systems and their adjacent native vegetation were evaluated. In addition, the forest inventory, the diameter distribution and vertical stratification of tree species were measured. The SAFs deployed from the management of native vegetation had a plant biodiversity and carbon stock in biomass, litter and soil similar to that of the adjacent area of native vegetation. On the other hand, carbon stocks. in SAF deployed in the area cultivated with annual crops had lower species diversity and carbon stocks in biomass, litter and soil in relation to native vegetation adjacent. Agroforestry systems well managed have carbon stocks and biodiversity of natural resources like native vegetation.

TI  - Responses of soil nematode communities to agroecological crop management systems
T2  - NEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nematodes are sensitive to human intervention and widely used as biological indicators of disruptions and alterations in soil quality. The aim of this work was to identify nematodes that are good biological indicators in maize crops under different management systems, and to establish the impact levels of these systems. Soil samples were collected over a 3-year period at a depth of 0.0-0.3 m in areas under six different management systems for maize (Zea mays) monoculture, and intercropped maize and Canavalia ensiformis. Six areas of native vegetation were also assessed to provide a reference for ecological balance. After identification and counting, nematode communities were characterised according to abundance (total and relative), diversity (identified genera and diversity indexes), trophic structure and ecological maturity (disturbance indexes). Nematodes proved to be good ecological indicators, responding to the systems employed. Intercropping maize and Canavalia ensiformis in at least one assessment year reduced disruption and increased nematode diversity, which were both verified based on specific indexes. It was also observed that the maize monoculture increased disruption leading to a drop in nematode fauna diversity and an increase in the incidence of plant-feeding nematodes.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and origin under different cacao agroforestry systems in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems (AFS) are characterized by accumulating large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, information on the influence of shade trees on SOC stock up-to 100 cm depth is scarce in the literature. The objectives of this study were to quantify the SOC storage under different cacao AFS, natural forest and pasture to a depth of 100 cm; and to evaluate the origin of SOC using the C-13 isotopic ratio as an indicator of relative contribution of trees (C-3 plants) and grass (C-4 plants), after 4 years of pasture conversion into cacao and rubber AFS. SOC was determined by dry combustion in six layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm). The natural abundance of C-13 technique was used only on cacao and rubber lines in contrast to the SOC accumulated by pasture before conversion into AFS. The SOC stock in a depth between 0-100 cm was significantly high in the pasture and in both younger cacao and rubber AFS (4 years old). Systems that were more than 20 years old 'cabruca', cacao and Erythrina and cacao and rubber system (20 years) had lower SOC stocks and did not differ significantly from the natural forest. In the surface layers of soil there were significant differences in the SOC stock. However, below 20 cm all the systems were similar to each other. The SOC stock in the first 20 cm accounted between 31 and 44% of total SOC stored in the 100 cm in the seven systems, followed by 19-23% at a depth of 20-40 cm, 15-18% at a depth of 40-60 cm and 11-14% in the last two depths. After four years of establishment cacao and rubber AFS were the most efficient systems in the accumulation of SOC in the first 20 cm of soil and consequently up to 100 cm deep. Cacao was more efficient than rubber tree to accumulate C-3-derived C. While the rubber increased by almost 70% of C-3, cacao increased 131%. After the 40 cm of depth the SOC is still from the original natural forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landscape and farm-level management for conservation of potential pollinators in Indonesian cocoa agroforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), a major commodity globally, depends on insects for pollination. However, the cocoa pollinator identity is largely unknown and there are important knowledge gaps regarding landscape and farmlevel management driving pollinators. Here we analyzed flower visitation with two approaches to quantify how landscape and farm-level factors affect potential pollinators (flower visitors) of cocoa in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the first approach (landscape and farm-level) we selected 18 farms and focused on the relative importance of distance to forest (m), potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm (i.e. secondary forests and cocoa agroforests [%]), canopy cover (%), leaf-litter amount (kg/m2), and cocoa flower abundance for flower visitors. In the second approach (experimental farm management) we manipulated leaf-litter in 24 farms, because high leaf-litter is suggested to enhance flower visitors. We found that ants and Diptera were the most common flower visitors, and although previous studies suggest ceratopogonids as main cocoa pollinators, none were captured in this study. In the landscape and farm-level approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm, and increased canopy cover enhanced ant and Diptera abundance, whereas distance to forest had no effect. In the experimental farm management approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm rather than leaf-litter manipulation increased Diptera and ant abundance. In summary conservation of forests and agroforests surrounding the farm, maintaining canopy cover and minimum leaf-litter enhance cocoa flower visitors. Thus, farms with shade trees embedded in a biodiversity-friendly landscape are important for conservation of potential pollinators and pollination services and, thereby, promotion of sustainable cocoa.

TI  - Nematodes as bioindicators of soil health in different land uses in the Sao Francisco River Valley, Brazil.
T2  - Nematology
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse, seasonally dry, tropical forests of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. One way of understanding changes in the soil conditions caused by anthropogenic activities is using the nematode assemblages as potential bioindicators. This study analysed changes in nematode communities in three different types of land use (natural forest-CA, natural area with accumulation of salts-SS, and agricultural growing areas, such as cover crops-CC for cattle and fruit trees-IC) in the Caatinga, in the sub-median region of the Sao Francisco River Valley (SFRV), Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. We recorded a total of 63 262 nematode individuals, representing 42 genera, belonging to 23 families. Nematode abundance, diversity and maturity indices were highest in the CC and lowest in the SS. Among the nematode trophic groups, bacterivores, omnivores + predators and plant parasites were significantly affected by type of land use. Different soil properties were related to the differences in taxonomic composition among the natural and agricultural areas, accounting for 26.6% of the total variation. In general, our results indicate that soil salinisation and desertification in the natural areas, as well as soils subjected to cover crops and fruit tree production, significantly influenced the composition of nematode communities in the Sao Francisco River Valley.

TI  - Committed carbon emissions, deforestation, and community land conversion from oil palm plantation expansion in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial agricultural plantations are a rapidly increasing yet largely unmeasured source of tropical land cover change. Here, we evaluate impacts of oil palm plantation development on land cover, carbon flux, and agrarian community lands in West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. With a spatially explicit land change/carbon bookkeeping model, parameterized using high-resolution satellite time series and informed by socioeconomic surveys, we assess previous and project future plantation expansion under five scenarios. Although fire was the primary proximate cause of 1989-2008 deforestation (93%) and net carbonemissions (69%), by 2007-2008, oil palm directly caused 27% of total and 40% of peatland deforestation. Plantation land sources exhibited distinctive temporal dynamics, comprising 81% forests on mineral soils (1994-2001), shifting to 69% peatlands (2008-2011). Plantation leases reveal vast development potential. In 2008, leases spanned similar to 65% of the region, including 62% on peatlands and 59% of community-managed lands, yet < 10% of lease area was planted. Projecting business as usual (BAU), by 2020 similar to 40% of regional and 35% of community lands are cleared for oil palm, generating 26% of net carbon emissions. Intact forest cover declines to 4%, and the proportion of emissions sourced from peatlands increases 38%. Prohibiting intact and logged forest and peatland conversion to oil palm reduces emissions only 4% below BAU, because of continued uncontrolled fire. Protecting logged forests achieves greater carbon emissions reductions (21%) than protecting intact forests alone (9%) and is critical for mitigating carbon emissions. Extensive allocated leases constrain land management options, requiring trade-offs among oil palm production, carbon emissions mitigation, and maintaining community landholdings.

TI  - Can Community Forests Be Compatible With Biodiversity Conservation in Indonesia?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest lands in Indonesia are classified as state lands and subject to management under agreements allocated by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. There has been a long-standing tension between the ministry and local communities who argue that they have traditionally managed large areas of forest and should be allowed to continue to do so. A series of recent legal and administrative decisions are now paving the way for the allocation of forests to local communities. There is a hypothesis that the communities will protect the forests against industrial conversion and that they will also conserve biodiversity. This hypothesis needs to be closely examined. Conservation of biodiversity and management for local benefits are two different and potentially conflicting objectives. This paper reviews examples of forests managed by local communities in Indonesia and concludes that there is very limited information available on the conservation of natural biodiversity in these forests. I conclude that more information is needed on the status of biodiversity in community managed forests. When forests are allocated for local management, special measures need to be in place to ensure that biodiversity values are monitored and maintained.

TI  - Effect of rosewood plantation chronosequence on soil attributes in Central Amazonia
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora Ducke) is an endangered Amazonian tree species that produces a commercially valuable essential oil, used mainly in cosmetics and fine fragrances production. The species can also be used in reforestation programs, which generate jobs and as a source of income and reduce the pressure of exploitation on natural rosewood populations. The objective of this study was to verify the influence of rosewood stands on physical and chemical soil attributes. This study was conducted at a rural farm in the Males municipality, 350 km from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. Samples were collected in five areas; 4-, 10- and 20-year-old rosewood stands, and 15- and 60-year-old secondary forests. The latter two served as control treatments, reflecting natural spontaneous succession conditions over time. Soil was sampled at 10 equidistant points within each area to measure physicochemical attributes, and at the center of each one, a soil profile was dug for description and classification of morphological characteristics. Based on the profile description, the soils were classified as Xanthic Hapludox. The results show that soil conditions under 20-year-old rosewood stand resembled those beneath the 60-year-old secondary forest, and likewise for the soil under the 10-year-old rosewood stand and the 15-year-old secondary forest. The soil bulk density ranged from 0.81 to 0.99 g cm(-3) among all areas and no significant difference was found (P = 0.052). With exception to 4-year-old stand, the organic matter (2.68-5.87%) and carbon stock (18.57-31.71 Mg ha(-1)) did not differ significantly between stands and control treatments. For the soil macronutrients, nitrogen (0.10-0.22%), phosphorus (1.17-11.70 mg kg(-1)), calcium (0.03-0.31 mg kg(-1)) and magnesium (0.02-0.16 mg kg(-1)) were higher or equal in the rosewood stands in comparison to the two controls, while the potassium values (0.03-0.36 mg kg(-1)) were significantly higher in 60-year-old secondary forests only compared to the 10-year-old rosewood stands (P = 0.005). The soil beneath the 4-year-old rosewood stand, however, differed from the other four areas, having significantly higher natural clay content ( > 600 g kg(-1)) and higher topsoil chemical concentrations, associated with the more recent burning. This result represents the first step in addressing concern about sustainable soil use in rosewood forestry economics. Consequently, this kind of rosewood plantation can be recommended as an appropriate use of historically exploited areas, providing economic return from local biodiversity.

TI  - Structure of mixed ombrophyllous forests with Araucaria angustifolia (Araucariaceae) under external stress in Southern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is part of the Floristic and Forest Inventory of Santa Catarina, conceived to evaluate forest resources, species composition and structure of forest remnants, providing information to update forest conservation and land use policy in Southern Brazilian State of Santa Catarina (95 000km(2)). In accordance to the Brazilian National Forest Inventory (IFN-BR), the inventory applies systematic sampling, with 440 clusters containing four crosswise 1 000m(2) plots (20x50m) each, located on a 10x10km grid overlaid to land use map based on classification of SPOT-4 images from 2005. Within the sample units, all woody individuals of the main stratum (DBH >= 10cm) are measured and collected (fertile and sterile), if not undoubtedly identified in field. Regeneration stratum (height>1.50m; DBH<10cm) is registered in 100m(2) in each sample unit. Floristic sampling includes collection of all fertile trees, shrubs and herbs within the sample unit and in its surroundings. This study performs analysis based on 92 clusters measured in 2008 within an area of 32 320km(2) of mixed ombrophyllous forests with Araucaria angustifolia located at the state's high plateau (500m to 1 560m above sea level at 26 degrees 00'-28 degrees 30' S and 49 degrees 13'-51 degrees 23' W). Mean density (DBH >= 10cm) is 578 individuals/ha (ranging from 85/ha to 1 310/ha), mean species richness in measured remnants is 35 (8 to 62), Shannon and Wiener diversity index (H') varies between 1.05 and 3.48. Despite high total species diversity (364 Magnoliophyta, five Coniferophyta and one tree fern) and relatively high mean basal area (25.75m(2)/ha, varying from 3.87 to 68.85m(2)/ha), the overwhelming majority of forest fragments are considered highly impacted and impoverished, mostly by logging, burning and extensive cattle farming, turning necessary more efficient protection measures. Basal area was considered an appropriate indicator for stand quality and conservation status. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(3): 1371-1387. Epub 2011 September 01.

TI  - Microaggregate-associated carbon as a diagnostic fraction for management-induced changes in soil organic carbon in two Oxisols
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stabilization by macroaggregate-occluded microaggregates (Mm) has been proposed as a principal mechanism for long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in temperate alternative agricultural and (af)forested systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the Mm fraction for long-term C stabilization in Oxisols and to validate its diagnostic properties for total SOC changes upon changes in land use. Soil samples were taken from the 0-5 and 5-20 cm soil layers of native forest vegetation (NV), conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems at an experimental site near Passo Fundo and one near Londrina in Southern Brazil. After aggregate-size separations by wet-sieving, macroaggregate-occluded water-stable microaggregates (53-250 mu m) (Mm) were isolated from large (> 2000 mu m) and small (> 250 mu m) macroaggregates. Particulate organic matter located inside the Mm (intra-Mm-POM) and the mineral fraction (< 53 mu m) associated with the Mm (mineral-Mm) were separated from the POM fraction located outside the Min (inter-Mm-POM) by density flotation followed by mechanical dispersion. Sand-free Mm-C concentrations on a macroaggregate basis were generally greater under NV and NT compared to CT in the 0-5 cm depth at both sites. Our findings support the importance of Mm (especially the mineral-Mm fraction) as long-term C-stabilization sites in highly weathered tropical soils under sustainable agricultural and natural systems. At both sites, significant differences in total SOC stocks (g C m(-2)) among different land use systems were always accompanied by parallel Mm-C stock differences. Though total SOC did not differ among land use systems in the 0-20 cm depth at both sites. Mm-C stocks were greater under NT compared to the CT treatment in the 0-20 cm, depth at the Londrina site. We concluded that in these highly weathered tropical soils the Mm-C fraction is a more responsive fraction to management changes than total SOC and represents a diagnostic fraction for present as well as potential total SOC changes upon land-use change.

TI  - Soil physical quality in response to intensification of grain production systems
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado stands out in relation to grain production, however, in this region the occurrence of summer and irregular rainfall, drastically harm the non-irrigated production. Conservationist managements favor the soil physical quality and, consequently, the efficiency of soil water consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil physical quality, as a function of the conservation managements adopted, by using physical soil quality indicators, and to verify its relation with the soil organic carbon stocks and the grain yield in the Cerrado of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. For that, six treatments were evaluated: soybean (1) and maize (2) monocultures crop systems at medium level of investment in soil fertilization, soybean-maize crop succession at medium (3) and high (6) level of investment in soil fertilization, and crop succession of soybean-maize and intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis at medium (4) and high (5) level of investment in soil fertilization, during the initial stage of no-tillage system. The treatments 3, 4, 5 and 6 showed improvement in the soil physical quality in relation to the monoculture. Pore distribution and soil organic carbon content were the main responsible for discriminating the intensified crop systems. Attributes related to water availability were important for plant growth in the 0-0.05 m layer, while for the 0.15-0.20 m layer, the highest soil aeration stood out. Productivity did not correlate with the evaluated attributes.

TI  - Predictive Models to Estimate Carbon Stocks in Agroforestry Systems
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the carbon stock in a pasture area and fragment of forest in natural regeneration, given the importance of agroforestry systems in mitigating gas emissions which contribute to the greenhouse effect, as well as promoting the maintenance of agricultural productivity. Our other goal was to predict the carbon stock, according to different land use systems, from physical and chemical soil variables using the Random Forest algorithm. We carried out our study at an Entisols Quartzipsamments area with a completely randomized experimental design: four treatments and six replites. The treatments consisted of the following: (i) an agroforestry system developed for livestock, (ii) an agroforestry system developed for fruit culture, (iii) a conventional pasture, and (iv) a forest fragment. Deformed and undeformed soil samples were collected in order to analyze their physical and chemical properties across two consecutive agricultural years. The response variable, carbon stock, was subjected to a boxplot analysis and all the databases were used for a predictive modeling which in turn used the Random Forest algorithm. Results led to the conclusion that the agroforestry systems developed both for fruit culture and livestock, are more efficient at stocking carbon in the soil than the pasture area and forest fragment undergoing natural regeneration. Nitrogen stock and land use systems are the most important variables to estimate carbon stock from the physical and chemical variables of soil using the Random Forest algorithm. The predictive models generated from the physical and chemical variables of soil, as well as the Random Forest algorithm, presented a high potential for predicting soil carbon stock and are sensitive to different land use systems.

TI  - Nest Characteristics of the Sumatran Orangutan (Pongo abelii) in the Wildlife Sanctuary Soraya Station in Aceh Province, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Orangutans (Pongo spp.) populations used to be widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from Java in the south to the Southern China in the north during the Pleistocene. Their populations have declined up to 75% of their original size and are now distributed only in parts of the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo tapanuliensis and Pongo abelli are the three most representative species, in this study, here we discussed the latter. Sumatran forests are generally suffering from deforestation with rates ranging from 3.74% to 49.85% between 2000 and 2012. Thus, human wildlife conflict intensity has escalated and gained more traction. Orangutans are known as arboreal great apes and need to build nests for resting. We applied the transect line method (three transects; each 1,000 m long) at different elevations in Soraya Research Station, Gelombang Village, Sultan Daulat sub-district, Subulussalam district, and assessed the nest characteristics. The characteristics are: (1) nesting position referring to the position of nest on a tree; (2) nest successional stages defining the age and leaf decay used in constructing a nest indicated with I (new) until V (almost gone); and (3) nest density to predict the density of nest per square km. Afterwards, the identified nesting trees along the transect were further identified based on their species, and assessed based on three characteristics (the tree height, diameter and the height of a nest measured from the soil). A total of 27 nests were found, and 44% were located in transect III or at the riparian. Out of 27, four orangutans' nests were found on Moraceae (Streblus elongatus) and Myrtaceae (Syzigium spp.), while three nests were found on Dipterocarpus sp. The tree height, tree diameter and nest height were 10 m-25 m (mean = 17.5 m; SD = +/- 0.25), 10 cm-30 cm (mean = 20 cm; SD = +/- 0.4) and 16 m-20 m (mean = 18 m; SD = +/- 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, nest density calculated based on the form: d = [NI (L* 2w)], and the values obtained were 8.4, 13.45, 26.9 nests/km(2) located on transect I, II and III or at the riparian. The most commonly found nest successional stages and position were stage III and position 3, respectively. This study could serve as a baseline research in primate conservation and nest characterisation could be used as guidance for any future activity planning (e.g. tree reforestation) in a particular region and the existence of various tree species diversity are indispensable for maintaining orangutan habitats' quality.

TI  - Decreasing Deforestation in the Southern Brazilian Amazon-The Role of Administrative Sanctions in Mato Grosso State
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation efforts through regulatory enforcement routinely failed to prevent large scale deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. However, a turning point occurred in 2005, when a combination of unfavorable economic conditions and an unprecedented coordinated effort between governmental institutions resulted in a gradual slowdown in deforestation. The continuation of this deforestation slowdown in an environment of economic recovery and expansion after 2009 suggests that regulatory enforcement achieved a measure of success not experienced before. In this study, the impact of fines, embargoes on rural private properties, and confiscation of means of production and produce on deforestation in the Southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso was considered through regression and GIS-based analyses. It was found that while all three sanctions were negatively correlated with deforestation, there were important differences in their level of enforcement. Embargoes were effectively implemented and showed high deforestation deterrence effectiveness, but the actual collection of the values of fines issued was extremely low, which casts doubts on their actual effectiveness as a deforestation deterrence mechanism. The results suggest that while sanctions for illegal deforestation have played an important role in the slowdown in deforestation, measures to increase the collection of fines issued are urgently needed.

TI  - Functional and taxonomic alpha and beta diversity responses to burning grasslands in southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Grasslands in subtropical Brazil are known as potentially fire-prone ecosystems. Aiming to better understand the effects of fire on biodiversity, we addressed the following questions: does fire benefit all alpha and beta components of taxonomic and functional diversity in grasslands; which functional groups are affected; does diversity foster recovery of above-ground biomass after fire? Location Campos grassland, southern Brazil Methods The effects of fire were investigated using a before/after control/impact experimental design. A randomized block design with seven replicates was set up, where a fire experiment was established after three years of both grazing and fire exclusion. Each block contained two paired 10 m x 10 m plots. We assessed plant species composition, plant functional trait composition, plant functional groups, and above-ground biomass before and after fire in both burnt and control plots. Results Both taxonomic and functional alpha diversity increased in burnt plots and decreased in unburnt plots across time. Taxonomic species richness considering total species increased more than considering common species only. Functional beta diversity increased in burnt plots while taxonomic beta diversity stayed similar between treatments. Forb total cover increased after fire while graminoids and shrubs remained unchanged. Burnt plots with high initial functional richness presented greater biomass recovery, whereas species richness presented no relation with above-ground biomass. Conclusions Fire increases species and functional richness in plots of subtropical Campos grasslands (alpha diversity component), and while it increases functional beta diversity, taxonomic beta diversity remained unchanged. Functional diversity is important for maintaining grassland biomass recovery after fire.

TI  - Black carbon and black nitrogen storage under long-term paddy and non-paddy management in major reference soil groups
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-residue burning and frequent paddy-soil flooding can lead to a substantial accumulation of black carbon (BC), thus contributing to long-term C sequestration. There is evidence that the turnover of BC in soils also depends on the soil mineral assembly. We studied the effects of paddy and non-paddy soil management and different major reference soil groups on BC storage. We hypothesized that overall BC storage in soil relates to paddy management and the abundance of reactive mineral phases such as Fe and Al oxides, and clay-sized minerals. Parallel to BC, black nitrogen (BN) should accumulate in soil.Paddy and non-paddy soils were sampled in three different climate zones (tropical, subtropical, and temperate). The soil profiles comprised six replicates of Andosols, Alisols and Vertisols from Java (Indonesia), and Alisols and Cambisols from China, as well as one Fluvisol and Gleysol from Northern Italy.Samples were taken by horizon down to >1 m depth and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC) and BC. The latter was analyzed by oxidation to benzene polycarboxylic acids. Abundance of BN (as aromatic N) was estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of selected topsoil horizons.In topsoils BC vs. SOC accumulation was affected by management for Andosol, Alisols in China, and Vertisols. However, both flooding and crop-residue management seemed to control this. BC contents relative to SOC also differed between the reference soil groups, independent of management (p < 0.0001), yet were surprisingly constant within replicates. We conclude that BC co-accumulated with SOC in all soils. However, the overall storage of BC (1 m depth) was affected by a combination of soil group and management. Vertisols contained the largest BC stocks (17-19 t ha(-1) in non-paddy and paddy fields), followed by Andosols and Alisols (6-10 t BC ha(-1) under paddy management; 3-8 t ha(-1) under non-paddy management). The Gleysol and Fluvisol had the smallest BC stocks, independent of soil use (3-4 t ha(-1)).Aromatic N proportions increased to >50% of total N after combustion of rice straw. However, aromatic N was barely, or not detectable in soil, and there was no correlation to BC. We conclude that burned crop residues were not a major source for aromatic N in soil. BC and aromatic N showed no distinct relations to soil properties, such as the abundance of clay-sized minerals, and Al and Fe oxides. Differences in BC stocks between the soils were most pronounced in the subsoils, likely caused by physical processes, such as swelling and shrinking of clays and/or translocation by leaching. Climate and regional soil-adjusted management also affected BC accumulation, but this first snapshot indicates that global BC maps may be linked to global soil maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - SHORT-TERM IMPACTS ON SOIL-QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN ALTERNATIVE LAND USES OF TRADITIONAL PADDY FIELDS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till, crop diversity and integrated crop-livestock systems are proposed managements to increase agriculture sustainability in the rice paddies of the Southern Brazilian lowlands and avoid degradation in the region. Because soil is considered a key medium in which management modifications can be measured, our study aimed to evaluate soil-quality impacts by measuring carbon and nitrogen stocks and microbial activity 18 months after the adoption of different paddy-farming systems in an Albaqualf soil of Southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of five paddy-farming systems with a range of vegetation diversity (both in time and in space) and grazing seasons. In addition, a reference area (i.e. native forest) was sampled for comparison. We verified that soil quality was affected over the short term through the adoption of no-till, crop diversity and integrated grazing practices. However, during the study period, only the system with low anthropic and/or mechanical intervention and high plant diversity differed from the traditional paddy land-use approach in Brazil in terms of soil-quality effects. This system achieved a carbon management index of 49 (approximately half that of the native forest) and had the highest enzymatic activity (similar to native forest). These outcomes were primarily due to an increase in the particulate organic matter fraction of the soil carbon stock (4.6 M g ha(-1) more than in rice monocropping). To evaluate changes in soil quality over the long term, additional studies are required. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Drivers of fire occurrence in a mountainous Brazilian cerrado savanna: Tracking long-term fire regimes using remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in savannas, and defines vegetation physiognomy and structure, often influencing species diversity. Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

TI  - Chemical characterization of organic matter in soil aggregates under cacao agroforestry systems assessed by solid-state <SUP>13</SUP>C CPMAS NMR
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao-based agroforestry systems can sequester much soil carbon (C), but information on soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition within aggregates still needs to be available. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the impact of forest or pasture conversion to cacao AFS by assessing the chemistry of the Cm fraction, considering this as the primary C pool in the studied soils, and (2) which C chemical compounds are associated with the aggregate density fractions. Soil chemical characterization was performed using solid-state C-13 CPMAS NMR. The conversion of pasture into cacao AFS did not impact the chemical composition of C. However, converting natural forest into cacao AFS provided differences in the composition of C compounds, mainly in macroaggregates. Notably, the young rubber tree was more prevalent in promoting changes in the chemical composition of C than cacao. The chemical composition of C in Cm density fractions did not vary across the land-use systems, and it was mostly represented by alkyl-C and O/N-alkyl-C forms. The composition of POM fractions was mainly aryl-C. The knowledge of soil organic matter chemical composition proved to be an adequate tool for application in models to establish management strategies and guide policy toward consolidating low-carbon agriculture in Brazil.

TI  - The role of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in assessment of forest condition, pressures and conservation actions at key forest sites in tropical Asia and New Guinea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in tropical Asia and New Guinea provide local and global benefits to people and are exceptionally rich in biodiversity but they have receded by more than 75% in the past 100 years. This project set out to strengthen effective engagement of non-state actors in forest monitoring, planning and policy processes in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Guinea, and hence reduce the rate of loss of tropical forests and biodiversity. Monitoring assessments of state, pressure and response were undertaken at key sites for biodiversity conservation using a monitoring protocol established for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas. Indigenous Peoples and local communities participated in a range of surveillance activities. These assessments were supported by global datasets on tree cover loss and forest integrity. The inputs from Indigenous Peoples and local communities were especially valuable in implementing actions, informing national and regional policies, and in helping them manage their local environment and resources.

TI  - Influence of river tide dynamics on phytoplankton variability and its ecological implications in three Brazilian tropical estuaries (Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area)
T2  - CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Delta do Parna & iacute;ba Environmental Protection Area (EPA) represents one of the largest deltaic systems in the Americas. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of phytoplankton communities and their correlation with environmental factors and assessed their trophic status and water quality across three mesotidal estuaries (Parna & iacute;ba-PRE, Comum-CRE, and Bom Gosto-BGRE) over a year-long sampling period. Multivariate analyses explored the interplay between environmental parameters, phytoplankton communities, and trophic indices. Salinity has emerged as a key determinant in these estuaries. Trophic components influence nutrient dynamics, with Redfield ratios indicating colimitation by orthophosphate (PO-43) and silicate (SiO2-). This study identified 355 taxa within the phytoplankton community, with Chlorophyta predominating in the PRE and diatoms dominating in estuaries with relatively high salinities (BGRE and CRE). Environmental drivers vary across estuaries, with temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chll-a), and the trophic index (TRIX) influencing the phytoplankton community in the PRE, while salinity, PO-43, total phosphorus (TP), and TN affect the CRE, and salinity and Chll-a influence the BGRE. The Delta do Parna & iacute;ba EPA exhibits eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions, emphasising the need for comprehensive environmental monitoring, nutrient management, and conservation efforts to safeguard biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem health.

TI  - BIRDS OF TWO PROTECTED AREAS IN THE SOUTHERN RANGE OF THE BRAZILIAN ARAUCARIA FOREST
T2  - Papeis Avulsos de Zoologia (Sao Paulo)
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 70% of threatened birds in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, inhabit forest environments. The creation and maintenance of protected areas is one of the most important measures aiming to mitigate these problems. However, the knowledge of the local biodiversity is essential so that these areas can effectively preserve the natural resources. Between 2004 and 2009 we sampled the avifauna in two conservation units in Rio Grande do Sul: Floresta Nacional de Canela (FNC) and Parque Natural Municipal da Ronda (PMR), both representative of the Mixed Humid Forest (Araucaria Forest). A total of 224 species was recorded, 116 at FNC and 201 at PMR, ten of which threatened regionally: Pseudastur polionotus, Odontophorus capueira, Patagioenas cayennensis, Amazona pretrei, A. vinacea, Triclaria malachitacea, Campephilus robustus, Grallaria varia, Procnias nudicollis and Sporophila melanogaster. Richness and species composition seem to be related to different stages of forest conservation, to size and connectivity, as well as to the diversity of environments. The better conservation of PAIR compared to FNC, allied to its geographic position, results in a richer avifauna, with a larger amount of rare and endangered species, as well as species sensitive to disturbance and endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest. We suggest management actions aiming the conservation and the long-term recovery of natural environments at these sites.

TI  - The influence of fire on the assemblage structure of foraging birds in grasslands of the Serra da Canastra National Park, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are the most threatened physiognomies of the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savanna), a biodiversity hotspot with conservation as a priority. The Serra da Canastra National Park protects the most important remnants of the Cerrado's southern grasslands, which are under strong anthropogenic pressure. The present study describes the structure of bird assemblages that directly use food resources in burned areas, comparing areas affected by natural fire to the areas where controlled fires were set (a management strategy to combat arson). The tested null hypothesis was that different bird assemblages are structured in a similar manner, regardless of the post-fire period or assessed area. Between December/2012 and January/2015, 92 species were recorded foraging in the study areas. The results indicate that both types of burnings triggered profound and immediate changes in bird assemblages, increasing the number of species and individuals. Natural fires exhibited a more significant influence on the structure (diversity and dominance) than prescribed burnings. Nevertheless, all the differences were no longer noticeable after a relatively short time interval of 2-3 months after prescribed burnings and 3-4 after natural fires. The findings may help the understanding of prescribed burnings as a management strategy for bird conservation in grasslands.

TI  - Acoustic indices as proxies for biodiversity in certified and non-certified cocoa plantations in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic indices allow time efficient analysis of large acoustic datasets obtained from passive acoustic monitoring, but results regarding their effectiveness in assessing biodiversity are inconsistent. We evaluated the efficacy of six acoustic indices (ACI, ADI, AEI, H, BI, NDSI) for studying bird and structural diversity in 51 cocoa plantations, 24 of which were certified by Rainforest Alliance, in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used linear models to assess the correlation of index values with bird species richness, and linear mixed models to test the influence of canopy closure, shade tree basal area, distance to primary forest and tree cover in a 200-m buffer on index values. Bird species richness was positively correlated with BI (p = 0.02) and negatively with H (p = 0.03), yet predictive power was low (R2 = 0.10 and 0.09, respectively). Acoustic indices did not differ significantly for certified cocoa plantations. Tree cover within the 200-m buffer moderately well predicted ACI values (marginal R2 = 0.37) while for the other indices effect sizes were low or correlations were not significant. Comparing our results to other studies, acoustic indices may reflect biodiversity across land uses, but were of limited value for tracking subtle differences in cocoa plantations in Sulawesi. Future studies may include more land uses (i.e. rice paddies, secondary forest, oil palm) as well as more taxa (i.e. insects). More research is needed on the comparability of acoustic indices, as we found them to be influenced by recording equipment and calculation settings.

TI  - Bird species of black water inundation forests in the Jau National Park (Amazonas state, Brazil): their contribution to regional species richness
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the relative contribution of blackwater inundation forest (igapo) and unflooded (terra firme) forest for regional bird species diversity in the lower Rio Negro region. For analyses of habitat preference we used mist-net samples and an unpublished bird species check-list. The igapo forest had lower bird species diversity than the terra firme forest. However, some 14% of the forest bird species in the region are restricted to igapo forest. Species composition was found to be distinct between the understories of the two forest types. Common forest bird guilds in the Neotropics such as ant-following birds avoid igapo forest. The differential habitat selection among birds in the inundated and unflooded forest is likely to result from vegetation structure and biological interactions such as aggressive behaviour. Since the inundated forest has a typical biota, conservation efforts needs to be directed to protect these habitats. Unfortunately, inundation forests are threatened by several human actions, especially dam construction. The extent of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon is insufficient for the adequate protection of the inundated habitats, because it includes only 3% of the total area.

TI  - Amphibians and reptiles from the Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Brazil, one of the world's largest urban forests
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Parque Nacional da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is considered to be one of the world's largest urban forests, however no systematic inventory of its herpetofauna is available. In the present study, we surveyed the amphibians and reptiles of this park to assess its species composition (including secondary data) and obtain estimates of species richness and abundance. We conducted active searches (460 hours) between January 2013 and December 2015. We identified the taxa endemic to either the Atlantic Forest or Rio de Janeiro state, and verified the conservation status of each species in the international, Brazilian, and state red lists. We also estimated the species richness and sampling sufficiency by rarefaction curves and Bootstrap richness estimator, and analyzed the distribution of the species abundance in Whittaker plots. We recorded 3,288 individuals over 36 months, representing 24 species of amphibians and 25 reptiles. The cumulative species curves, rarefaction, and the richness estimated indicated that sampling effort was adequate. Species abundance adjusted to the log-series model in both amphibians and reptiles. The four most abundant amphibians represented 70% of the individuals recorded in this group, while the two most abundant reptiles represented 60% of the total individuals. The inclusion of the secondary data raised the number of amphibian species to 38, and the number of reptiles to 36. Approximately 80% of the amphibian species and 28% of the reptile species recorded are endemic to the Atlantic Forest, and six of the amphibian species are endemic to Rio de Janeiro state. Six amphibian species and one reptile species are classified under some threat of extinction, and two reptile species were exotic. The considerable diversity of the herpetofauna of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca, which includes endemic and threatened species, reflects the effectiveness of the reforestation of this protected area and emphasizes the importance of its conservation.

TI  - Early Response of Tree Seed Arrival After Liana Cutting in a Disturbed Tropical Forest
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most remaining tropical forests are under some level of chronic human disturbance, which may favor the proliferation of disturbance-adapted native plants, like some species of tropical lianas. These plants may alter forest structure and composition, but little is known about their effect on ecological processes, such as seed rain. We analyzed the early effects of overabundant lianas on the seed rain of animal-dispersed tree species for 1 year. We analyzed the effect of overabundant lianas on seed rain by cutting all lianas in experimental plots of 314.1 m(2), establishing 12 paired plots with and without liana cutting in a disturbed Atlantic Forest remnant in Southeastern Brazil. Rarefied tree seed species richness was higher in plots dominated by lianas (10.9 +/- 0.2 and 8.3 +/- 1.2 for 500 seeds sampled in liana-dominated and liana-cut plots, respectively), but seed abundance was lower (209 +/- 138 and 984 +/- 421 seeds m(-2) in liana-dominated and liana-cut plots, respectively). Pioneer seed abundance (316.0 +/- 116.3 seeds m(-2)) and species density (3.2 +/- 0.3 species trap(-1)) did not differ among treatments. Lianas may eventually increase local seed rain diversity, while suppressing local tree seed rain abundance. Understanding the impact of the dominance of ruderal species in ecological processes that maintain tropical forests communities, such as seed rain, is crucial to guide the directions for conservation and management of degraded remnants.

AB  - Rote Ndao Regency is the southernmost region of Indonesia bordering Australia and Timor Leste. This regency has varieties of unique and endemic geology, biodiversity and inland waters. The regency has some 80 lakes where around 20 are saltwater lakes. The salinity of these lakes exceeds the salinity of seawater. The majority of these saltwater lakes are located in the Dead Sea Lake Region of Rote islands. Geologically, the islands have mixed deformations that move vertically and horizontally and are lifted partially from the Australian continent. The biodiversity in this region is also unique as there is a Roti snake-necked turtle that enters endangered animals. There are also unique mangroves conditions that live far from water sources due to vertical deformation. Rote Ndao also has areas of peat coal that are mixed with saltwater areas, freshwater areas, and brackish water areas. Remote sensing can be used to help effectively and efficiently in geological, biodiversity and inland waters mapping. This study aims to inform the related spatial information of the frontier region of Rote Ndao with the use of multidisciplinary remote sensing to realize Geopark. This multidisciplinary approach in remote sensing applications is used to obtain spatial information based on geo-biophysical and classification parameters. Data used in the form of similar to 65-70% remote sensing data and similar to 30-35% non-remote sensing data. Remote sensing data in the form of Landsat, Sentinel, WorldView-2, Planet, Grace, Goce, Champ, and others. This multidisciplinary approach includes remote sensing, geodesy, geology, limnology, biodiversity, water resources, forest conservation, and geo-informatics. The uniqueness of geology and biodiversity in the Dead Sea Lake Region of Rote is expected to make this region become a Geopark.

TI  - Intercropping of coffee with the palm tree, macauba, can mitigate climate change effects
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate changes can affect coffee production in Brazil, and in other coffee producing countries. We examined the potential for an agroforestry system with the native species, macauba (Acrocomia aculeata), to mitigate impacts on coffee production by reducing maximal air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of an agroforestry system with macauba on productivity, microclimatic characteristics and soil physical quality on a coffee plantation in the Atlantic Rainforest biome, in Southern Brazil. We measured soil attributes (moisture, temperature, and physical properties), microclimate conditions (air temperature, photosynthetic active radiation) and coffee production parameters (productivity and yield). Macauba palm trees were planted at different planting densities on the rows and distances from the coffee rows. Planting density of macauba and their distance from the coffee rows affected soil thermal-water regime. Compared with the traditional unshaded sole coffee planting, the intercropped cultivation provided more coffee yield on both macauba density planting and distance evaluated. On the other hand, coffee productivity was increased by agroforestry systems just for 4.2 m distance between palm trees and coffee rows. Planting density of macaubas did not affect coffee yield and productivity. Best coffee harvest in agroforestry systems with macauba was related to higher soil moisture at the depth of 20-40 cm, higher photosynthetic active radiation, and maximum air temperatures lower than 30 degrees C. Agroforestry with coffee and macauba trees can be an adaptation strategy under future climatic variability and change related to high temperatures and low rainfall.

TI  - The long-term effects of intensive grazing and silvopastoral systems on soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and microbial biomass
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is the largest exporter and the second-largest beef producer in the world. The country's biggest challenge has been to increase the production capacity of soils in an environmentally sustainable way. In this context, agricultural practices that preserve the environment have demonstrated high productivity and sustainability by emphasizing intensive grazing management and silvopastoral systems. In this study, the effects of the conversion of a native forest (FO) into different pasture-based cattle production systems were assessed in long-term field experiments using microbiological and physicochemical measurements. Five pasture systems were evaluated: i) irrigated high stocking rate pasture (IHS); ii) rainfed high stocking rate pasture (RHS); iii) rainfed moderate stocking rate pasture (RMS); iv) silvopastoral system with moderate stocking rate (SPS); and v) degraded pasture (DP), the latter used as a reference for conventional pasture management, extensively used by farmers. Soil samples (0-10 cm) were analyzed for bulk density (BD), total carbon content (TC), soil organic matter humifi-cation index (HLIFS), activities of soil enzymes beta-glucosidase (BG) and arylsulfatase (ARYL), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and basal respiration (BR). The results showed that all managed pastures presented higher soil carbon content than DP (16.2 +/- 1.7 g kg(-1)), especially the RMS system, which presented the highest carbon content (32.9 +/- 0.9 g kg(-1)). Activities of BG and ARYL were more sensitive to detecting management changes than MBC and BR. Increased activities of BG and ARYL were observed in the RMS system, possibly due to the higher amount of biomass input, while this effect was less expressive in the other management systems. The results indicated that soil enzymatic activities are sensitive to land use and management and could be used as soil quality indicators in pasture-based beef cattle production for different systems in tropical soils.

TI  - Relational values of forests: Value-conflicts between local communities and external programmes in Sulawesi
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies found that rapid decline of biodiversity and ecosystems globally have adversely affected an estimated 1.6 billion rural people whose livelihoods both directly and indirectly depend on forests. To halt the loss of forests and other natural ecosystems that simultaneously support rural livelihoods, various external programmes have been developed and applied, including market-based and rights-based approaches. However, rapid biodiversity and ecosystem decline continues, and better incentives or more secure rights have not always led to local community participation and improved livelihoods. This suggests the need to better explain local communities' motivations in nature stewardship. We conducted a study of local communities in two villages in Sulawesi who voluntarily maintain forests but showed resistance to participation in formal Social Forestry programmes. The study aimed to identify motivations and underlying reasons of community preferences, guided by two research questions: (i) how did local people value forest landscapes? and (ii) how did those values interact with externally driven Social Forestry programmes? We applied the Relational Values concept to understand a community's relations with the forest (or its elements) and land and identified points of value divergence. Data collection involved in-depth semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions framed by the principles of Appreciative Inquiry, participant observation and land use/land cover change analysis. Our findings show that people value their forests in relation to their identity, ancestral heritage, sense of place and spiritual values. We also identified the points of value divergence and their underlying reasons of resistance towards externally driven forestry programmes. This study thus contributes to the broader conceptualisation of values in conservation and community participation by providing empirical evidence on the importance of the Relational Values framework in understanding the motivation and behaviour of nature stewardship and in the evaluation of value conflicts.

TI  - Integrated production systems: An alternative to soil chemical quality restoration in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the main terrestrial carbon reservoir. The spatial distribution of SOC is mainly regulated by environmental factors and anthropogenic activity. Historically, land-use change has been responsible for much of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, carbon storage can be improved through agricultural management, either by increasing carbon inputs through higher crop yields or by delaying the release of carbon into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to correctly choose which cover crops to use and how long these crops will remain in the crop rotation system. In order to clarify these issues, the objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical quality and changes in soil carbon stock between no-tillage and soybean/com crop succession systems and integrated crop-livestock systems. The study was carried out in Querencia (MT), Brazil, located in the Cerrado/Amazon ecotone. The integrated systems were studied between 2007 and 2014. These systems followed annual crop rotation and forage rotation, and were laid out as a consortium or were isolated, with the aim of producing grain and meat. In order to determine soil chemical properties, 170 sampling plots were randomized among the treatments. The highest carbon values were observed in the integrated crop-livestock systems (ICL), probably due to higher inputs of organic residues. Crop rotation with plants of different families allowed better land use and soil exploration. However, integrated production systems comprising longer pasture periods, no-tillage, and soybean/corn crop succession decreased soil carbon. When comparing carbon stocks from 2010 to 2014, only integrated production systems ICL2 and ICL3 were able to increase carbon stocks. Our results highlight the importance of length of growing and correct choice of cover crops in maintaining SOC stocks, and thus provide insights to improve SOC stocks in agricultural land in Brazil's main producing region.

TI  - Preservation of labile organic compounds is the pathway for carbon storage in a 23-year continuous no-till system on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - No-till (NT) system has the potential to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) in the topsoil and increase soil quality. However, SOC accumulation in the soil profile and the mechanisms for SOC stabilization in NT are still a matter of debate, especially for soils of the tropics. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the long-term effects of two tillage systems (conventional tillage - CT and no-till - NT) on chemical and physical mechanisms of SOC stabilization and how these are related to the accumulation of SOC in the soil profile. Soils were sampled (0-100 cm depth) from a long-term experiment (23 years) established on a Rhodic Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Soils under native vegetation (NV) were used as a baseline. Results showed that conversion of NV to agriculture decreased on average the SOC stock by 70.8 Mg ha-1 (-33%) in the 0-100 cm soil layer. Between tillage systems, higher SOC stock was observed under NT than that under CT in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers, resulting in higher SOC stock in the entire topsoil (0-20 cm) in the conservation system. In the subsoil (20-100 cm), SOC was similar for both tillage systems. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed differ-ences in the C composition between the tillage systems; an accumulation of labile compounds in the uppermost layer was observed under NT, which resulted in a lower SOM aromaticity index under this treatment than that in soil under CT management. Adoption of NT increased the proportion of large macroaggregates (> 2.0 mm) in 0-5 cm soil layer, resulting in a greater mean weight diameter (MWD) than under CT. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis of data for 0-20 cm soil layer showed that SOC stock is positively associated with labile compounds, the proportion of large macroaggregates, and MWD, and negatively with small macroaggregates, aromatic compounds, and aromaticity index. These results indicated that the pathway for SOC accumulation in the topsoil of NT is influenced less by selective preservation but driven by the maintenance of labile organic compounds, a process achieved by the low turnover of large macroaggregates in the NT system.

TI  - Fire shapes mammal abundance at the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone: Scale of effect, species traits and land-cover interaction.
T2  - Journal for Nature Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical regions, which harbour the majority of the Earth's biodiversity, land-cover change emerges as the primary driver of biodiversity loss. However, despite the propensity for many tropical biomes to experience fires, and the rapidly accelerating pace of intensification in fire regimes, the role of fire in shaping ecological communities has largely been overlooked. We examined whether and how fire regime affected the abundance of mammal species, the scale at which these putative effects operated and how fire effect interacted with land cover. Using camera traps, we studied four mammal species with different ecological traits in the Kadiweu indigenous territory, a Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. Specifically, we used abundance models to analyse the response of mammal species to fire frequency, spatial extent, and time since fire. Our results showed that mammals responded to fire at scales that align with the scale of responses to land cover. We found that the type of response to fire, and the scale at which fire effects operate, depended on species and possibly on their traits. The smallest species Sylvilagus brasiliensis demonstrated a clear response to fire, as well as to the mean patch area of savanna, exclusively at the smallest scale studied (i.e., within 500-m radius buffers). The abundance of this species decreased with increasing proportion of land burned in the 12 months preceding the monitoring. In contrast, larger species, including Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris, showed no response to fire, while Pecari tajacu would exhibit a marginal response, at the larger scale of 1000 m. Our results emphasize the importance of adopting trait-based approaches that consider the multiple aspects of fire regimes, at multiple scales, to disentangle the mechanisms governing the effects of fire on biodiversity. This should promote effective and sustainable fire management compatible with systemic conservation of species and ecological traits in fire-prone biomes.

TI  - Soil carbon stock in different uses in the southern cone of Mato Grosso do Sul
T2  - REVISTA DE AGRICULTURA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the soil density (Sd) and the total organic carbon contents and stocks in different management systems and implementation times in the municipality of Iguatemi, MS, Brazil. A completely randomized design with four replications was applied to four areas: conventional tillage (CT), reformed pasture (RP), and degraded pasture (DP), in addition to a native forest (NF) area with no anthropic action. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 0-0.05, 0.05-0.1, and 0.1-0.2 m. The determination of Sd and total organic carbon content (TOC) allowed calculating the carbon stock (Delta stock), the stratification index (SI), and the carbon stock variation (ACstock), with subsequent multivariate analysis. The NF area presented the highest TOC contents at all depths compared to the managed areas, with a value of 17.45 g kg(-1) at a depth of 0-0.05 m. The RP and NF areas showed similar SI, which was higher in PD, with a value of 2.54. Except for RP, the other managed areas showed a negative ACstock in the soil profile relative to the NF area. The RP and NF areas promoted the maintenance of TOC in the soil, while DP and CT compromised the edaphic quality.

TI  - Diversity of mycorrhizal fungi and soil indicative species in coastal plantations of northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as soil indicators and the mycorrhization of native and exotic tree species planted in the Acarau basin, a transition area from the coast to the Brazilian semiarid region. Plots with 6-year-old trees of four native and three non-native species as well as one non-forested area were evaluated in terms of the diversity of AM fungi in the mycorrhizosphere and the root colonization by AM and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. Twenty-four AM fungi were identified;Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Glomus sinuosum, Paraglomus albidum, Acaulospora laevis,andAcaulospora brasiliensiswere abundant in the forest soil. Diversity, dominance, evenness and richness indices of AM fungi were higher in plots with native trees. All root samples were colonized by AM fungi and onlyAnadenanthera colubrina, Acacia mangium, Casuarina equisetifoliaandEucalyptus urophyllaformed associations with EcM fungi.Acaulosporamorphotypes served as soil indicators for coverings with the native speciesAstronium fraxinifoliumandColubrina glandulosa. Exotic species may favor the proliferation of rarer AM fungi. These fungi-plant relationships may be important in the management of forest systems, and the evidence with mycorrhizal associations allows the inclusion of Brazilian species in tropical reforestation.

TI  - Potential of integrated trees-pasture-based systems for GHG emission mitigation and improving soil carbon dynamics in the Atlantic forest biome, Southeastern of Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian cattle production is mainly carried out in pastures, and mitigating the livestock's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become an essential prerequisite. The importance of planted forests in beef cattle pasture-based integrated systems has been widely recognized in the context of GHG emission mitigation. Adopting the intensification and integration with forest and crops of pasture-based livestock production systems are alternatives to optimizing the soil and tree carbon (C) sequestration; however, research on tropical conditions is still necessary. This long-term trial evaluated the potential of C sequestration (soil + trees) of the forest and the grazing systems with two replicate areas of 3 ha each: 1. continuous stocking rate (CLS) - pasture under continuous stocking; 2. agropastoral or crop-livestock system (AGROP) - pasture under rotational stocking in rotation with corn; 3. agrosilvipastoral or crop-livestock-forestry system (AGROSIL) - similar to AGROP but including eucalyptus; 4. silvipastoral or livestock-forestry system (SIL) - pasture under rotational stocking + eucalyptus and 5. Atlantic Forest (FOR). Soil samples were analysed for texture, C and bulk density in eight soil layers from three to eight trenches for each treatment, then C stock and C accumulation rates were calculated. Data from Eucalyptus urograndis of the SIL and AGROSIL systems with 333 trees. ha- 1 during five first years and 166 trees. ha- 1 in subsequent years were collected (five- and eight-years old trees) and used to define the wood volume and acquire wood rings. Elemental analyzer CHN performed soil and trees C content. Equations for determining stem volume and tree biomass and, afterward, the C pools of the tree trunks were proposed. The potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e.. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil or soil + trees) was calculated, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. The participation of the C stock from the 0-30 cm soil layer was between 45 % and 53 % of the total C stock in the 0-100 cm soil layer. Regardless of the elevated C soil accumulation rates, 0.88, 2.54, and 1.74 t C. ha-1. year- 1 in the conversion stages CLS -> AGROP; AGROP -> SIL; AGROP -> AGROSIL, respectively, it was not possible to compensate for the negative result of the Forest -> CLS conversion (-2.55 t C. ha-1. year- 1) because this stage lasted 12 years, while the implementation of AGROSIL and SIL systems had only six years. However, when C tree accumulation rates were considered, the potential of GHG emission mitigation (t CO2 e. ha- 1. year- 1) by annual C sequestration (soil +trees) was 19.89 to AGROSIL and 18.97 to SIL, including the wood used for the lumber-mill scenario. Based on these results, it can be concluded that C sequestration in trees-pasture integrated systems occurs in layers deeper, with the diverse species contributing in different soil layers; there is a positive effect of improved land-use management, with the use of integrated systems on annual C soil sequestration and the trees consists of an important strategy to improve the GHG mitigation.

TI  - EFFECTS OF EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS ON SOIL ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN A BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST CONSERVATION UNIT
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a conservation hotspot due to its elevated level of biodiversity and current state of degradation. Some areas of Atlantic Forest have been replaced by eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil. Soil arthropods can be important indicators for assessing the recomposition of native forests after disturbs. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that exist differences in the composition and structure of soil arthropod communities among two plantations of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) in different stages of natural regeneration of Atlantic forest (YP = Young Plantation and MP = Mature Plantation, in less and more advanced stage of regeneration, respectively) and a fragment of Atlantic forest (FOREST), in wet and dry seasons, in Uniao Biological Reserve, Brazil, using pitfalls. Archaeognatha, Diplura, Opilionida, and Thysanura were restricted to the FOREST, while Diptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera were favored by the microclimatic conditions in eucalyptus plantations. Soil arthropod community in FOREST was more complex than those in eucalyptus plantations. In general, soil arthropod communities showed higher total abundance and richness of groups, while equability decreased, as regeneration of Atlantic forest advanced in eucalyptus plantations, making this community more similar to that observed in the FOREST. The average total abundance, average richness, and total richness of soil arthropods were higher in the wet season in all areas, but the opposite occurred for the equability. Soil arthropod community improved with the regeneration of native forest species under the eucalyptus plantations.

TI  - Long-term tillage and crop rotation effects on microbial biomass and C and N mineralization in a Brazilian Oxisol
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotation and tillage impact microbial C dynamics, which are important for sequestering C to offset global climate change and to promote sustainable crop production. Little information is available for these processes in tropical/subtropical agroecosystems, which cover vast areas of terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, a study of crop rotation in combination with no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems was conducted on an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) in an experiment established in 1976 at Londrina, Brazil. Soil samples were taken at 0-50, 50-100 and 100-200 mm depths in August 1997 and 1998 and evaluated for microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineralizable C and N. There were few differences due to crop rotation, however there were significant differences due to tillage. No tillage systems increased total C by 45%, microbial biomass by 83% and MBC:total C ratio by 23% at 0-50 mm depth over CT. C and N mineralization increased 74% with NT compared to CT systems for the 0-200 mm depth. Under NT, the metabolic quotient (CO2 evolved per unit of MBC) decreased by 32% averaged across soil depths, which suggests CT produced a microbial pool that was more metabolically active than under NT systems. These soil microbial properties were shown to be sensitive indicators of long-term tillage management under tropical conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different soil tillage and crop management systems on soil fauna groups, by means of multivariate analysis. In the canonical discriminant analysis the conservation soil management systems with crop succession were discriminated in relation to other treatments with crop rotation. The groups Acarina, Hymenoptera, Isopoda, and Collembola, and the Shannon index (H) showed the highest contribution for the discrimination between treatments. The correspondence analysis showed a strong association between Acarina and Hymenoptera groups with the treatment no-tillage with crop succession, and between Collembola group with the conventional tillage system.

TI  - A machine learning approach for country-level deployment of greenhouse gas removal technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The suitability of countries to deploy five greenhouse gas removal technologies was investigated using hierarchical clustering machine learning. These technologies include forestation, enhanced weathering, direct air carbon capture and storage, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and biochar. The use of this unsupervised machine learning model greatly minimises the likelihood of human bias in the assessment of GGR technology deployment potentials and instead takes a more holistic view based on the applied data. The modelling utilised inputs of bio-geophysical and techno-economic factors of 182 countries, with the model outputs highlighting the potential performance of these GGR methods. Countries such as USA, Canada, Brazil, China, Russia, Australia as well as those within the EU and Sub-Saharan Africa were identified as key areas suitable to deploy these GGR technologies. The level of certainty of the obtained deployment suitability categorisation ranged from 65 to 98 %. While the results show the need for regional collaboration between nations, they also highlight the necessity for nations to prioritise and integrate GGR technologies in their revised nationally determined contributions.

AB  - Five essential types of vegetation in Kampar regency are considered to influence the number of Apis dorsata population, namely natural forests, forest plantations (Acacia and Eucalyptus), oil palm plantations, rubber plantations, and river existence. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of vegetation types on the number of A. dorsata population. This study was conducted from April to November 2016 and covered all districts categorized as the center of wild honey production in Kampar regency. Each sialang tree was observed for the number of A. dorsata. Sialang trees are big giant trees that are usually inhabited by A. dorsata colonies. The number of populations of A. dorsata for each tree was approached by using linear regression equations. By using all types of equations, the influence of different types of vegetation compositions (natural forests, Acacia and Eucalyptus plantations, oil palm plantations, rubber plantations and river existence) on the number of A. dorsata colony could be determined. The results, in respective of the vegetation types, were 28.17%, 21.51%, 14.81%, 21.32% and 14.82%. Moreover, the number of A. dorsata population in each sialang tree reached its maximum population above 60,000 ha in natural forest. Surprisingly, the number of A. dorsata colonies inhabited each sialang tree showed a positive correlation with the increase of the oil palm plantations area.

TI  - Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Brazil's Caatinga and experimental agroecosystems
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a nutritious legume crop for both its grain and leaves and comprises an important component in both human and animal nutrition. In Brazil, the use of mulch, such as coconut fiber, and organic fertilizers to maximize cowpea production offers an alternative to conventional mineral fertilizer strategies. Farming practices affect the diversity and activity of soil microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), important plant growth promoters for legumes. Our objective was to determine the effect of mulching with coconut fiber and manure on AMF diversity in cowpea. Soil samples were collected from an Experimental Station in Petrolina, NE Brazil: one Caatinga (natural dry-forest vegetation), one fallow, and one experimental site established in the fallow area and cultivated with cowpea receiving cattle manure and four doses (0, 12, 24, 48 t/ha) of coconut fiber. AMF species richness, abundance, and diversity were evaluated. Sixty-four AMF species were recorded, with predominance of Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae. Highest species richness (47) was recovered from the Caatinga but AMF diversity was also high in the cultivated sites, demonstrating the importance of mycotrophic plants, such as cowpea, in crop production systems for the maintenance of AMF species richness. Although several species, such as Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata, Glomus trufemii, and Paraglomus pernambucanum, revealed pronounced sporulation patterns, even high doses of coconut fiber did not affect AMF richness and diversity, compared to fallow. Consequently, cultivation of mycotrophic plants and use of organic manures are able to maintain high AMF species richness in tropical agroecosystems.

TI  - Ants as bioindicators of soil quality in integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the ant community in different systems involving the crop rotations between livestock, under no-tillage, compared to other management systems and natural systems of the Mid-Western region. The study was carried out in the Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, on a Typic Hapludox soil, in parcels including crop-livestock rotation production system under no-tillage, rotated every two years, no-tillage crop system, succession of crops under conventional tillage, continuous pasture and two fragments of native vegetation, Cerrado and Semideciduous Forest. The samples of soil were conducted during the rainy season (2009/2010), and litter sampling performed with the use of mini-Winkler extractors, following the protocol ALL (Ants of the Leaf Litter). The results indicated that the morphospecies of Strumygenys sp. and Hypoponera sp. as potential bioindicators of soil quality, depending on their frequency changes in response to different systems observed. The study have demonstrated the importance of maintaining forest fragments as stock of local biodiversity and showed that integrated systems, such as crop-livestock, are less impact ful to the meso-fauna and contribute to the conservation of ant and maintenance of soil quality.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of Eucalyptus saligna leaf litter on grassland species: physical versus chemical factors
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In Southern Brazil, large areas of grassland have been replaced by Eucalyptus plantations. Vegetation is scarce under plantations which may be associated with Eucalyptus releasing of allelochemicals.Aims: To investigate effects of Eucalyptus saligna leaf litter on the colonisation and development of the ground layer by grassland species and if these effects were related to allelopathy.Methods: We assessed the effects of Eucalyptus litter on the establishment of species of the native grassland community and on seeded test species (Paspalum notatum and Lotus corniculatus - introduced). We tested the impact of the addition of E. saligna leaf litter, artificial leaves (shading and mechanical impediment) and shading. We also tested the phytotoxicity of the soil from E. saligna plantations.Results: Species richness, diversity, plant height, cover and biomass were lower in E. saligna leaves and artificial leaves treatments than in the control (absence of litter). The test species showed lower biomass and higher mortality in treatment plots with E. saligna leaves, artificial leaves and shading treatments than in the control. Allelochemicals did not accumulate in soil at phytotoxic levels.Conclusions: Eucalyptus saligna leaf litter suppresses the establishment of grassland vegetation, but the effects are mainly physical. Field evaluations with appropriate controls should be more extensively used in allelopathy investigations.

TI  - Chemical and Spectroscopic Characteristics of Humic Acids Under No-Tillage and Forest Systems
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the no-tillage system (NT) with different implantation times and vegetation cover on changes in the chemical and structural compositions of soil humified organic matter. Five areas with different NT management histories were studied; for 6 (NT6), 14 (NT14), 22 (NT22) years with succession of soybean/corn crops; for 12 years and 4 more years with corn and Brachiaria (NT+B), pasture for 39 years and native forest. Soil samples were collected at the depths of 0.0-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m. The changes in the quality of humic acid (HA) were evaluated by several chemical techniques (total organic carbon (TOC), fulvic acid fraction (FA), humic acid fraction (HA) and humin fraction (HU), ionizable functional groups, elemental composition) and spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, and Fourier transform mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy, called FTIR-PAS). On the surface, the TOC, carbon of the HA and HU fractions, total acidity, phenolic acidity, Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Hydrogen and Hydrogen/Carbon ratio were higher in the areas of forest, pasture and NT22. On the subsurface, the responses are the same as on the surface. However, the NT22 system presents higher FA, HA, carboxylic acidity and humification degree (HD). UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and FTIR-PAS can discriminate soils under different managements and under natural conditions. Agronomic practices have strongly affected the soil organic matter, in which the NT promotes the formation of HA with characteristics closer to those of the forest, as the implantation time increases, such as 22-year-old NT and pasture. This indicates that care must be taken in managing the no-till system to maximize its potential to promote stabilization of organic matter, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration.The humic substances contribute as sustainability indicators in agriculturalsystemsWere evaluated no-tillage system (NT) with different implantation times.The UV-Vis, fluorescence and FTIR-PAS discriminate soils under different managements.NT promotes humic acid formation with characteristics closer to those of the forest.

CL  - BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Indonesia has the world's third largest area of tropical forest. These forests are treasured for their high biodiversity, a result of the country's unique geographic positioning, but also as an economically important natural resource. Although the early decades of accelerated timber exploitation in Indonesia demonstrated little concern for the sustainability of forest resources, recently a shift to genuine conservationist forest policies can be observed. These new policies, however, mainly relate to the forestry sector and much less to the ongoing conflicts between the state and forest-dependent people. It is still a commonly held belief that swidden agriculturists are responsible for about half of Indonesia's annual deforestation. In order to solve this problem the country has defined a number of measures that attempt to convert swidden agriculturists into sedentary cultivators. In this paper these measures are discussed, and they are juxtaposed to new insights on the nature of the dynamics of swidden agriculture and the role that forest management plays in this agricultural method. The official schemes only propose some sort of plantation development, which significantly reduces biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. With an example of swidden agriculture from West Kalimantan, including it's important forest management component, this paper demonstrates that developing such existing agriculture-forest management holds the potential to bring economic development to the region, while biodiversity is conserved.

TI  - IMPACT ON A FISH ASSEMBLAGE OF THE MAINTENANCE DREDGING OF A NAVIGATION CHANNEL IN A TROPICAL COASTAL ECOSYSTEM
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dredging and dredge-spoil disposal are among the major problems in coastal management. Many of the scientific contributions concerning the impacts of this practice are based on the study of sessile organisms and subtropical environments. We evaluated changes in the composition and abundance of a fish assemblage resulting from dredging and sediment disposal at the mouth and in the adjacent waters of the Caravelas River on the north-eastern coast of Brazil. Samples were collected in two directly impacted and three adjacent areas. Differences among stations were not significant, but the dredged site had the least diverse station, as expected. The stations farthest from the directly impacted areas apparently were not influenced by the coastal work, thus suggesting localised effects. The contribution of the present study is particularly important because of the study area's proximity to others that have high conservation value such as mangrove forests and coral reefs, and the relevance of the subject given the continuing dredging activity.

TI  - Earthworm species in various land use systems in the Campos Gerais region of Lapa, Parana, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Campos Gerais region of Parana are on an ancient plateau of sandstone origin and are covered with a diverse vegetation including mainly grasslands and various types of Atlantic Forest (particularly Araucaria forest). The region represents an important natural capital for biodiversity conservation as well as for agricultural and forestry production. However, little is known of the species richness and diversity of soil macroinvertebrates in this region. In the present study we evaluated earthworm species occurrence and richness in five land use systems (LUS) in the southern part of the Campos Gerais in Lapa county. Earthworms were handsorted from up to 18 soil monoliths on five occasions over three years (Feb. 2014, Feb., Mar., Nov. 2015, Jul. 2016) in the following LUS: old native forest, native grassland, young regenerating forest and grass lawn in the Uru Reserve and annual crop fields (soybean) in neighboring private farms (not all systems were sampled on all occasions). Nine earthworm species belonging to four families and five genera were found, of which six were native and three exotic species (Dichogaster gracilis, Amynthas gracilis, A. corticis). Of the native species, Urobenus brasiliensis and Andiorrhinus duseni (a large bodied-worm) are already well known from S and SE Brazil, while the remaining four were new species that require further description (Fimoscolex n. sp. 1 and n. sp. 2, Glossoscolex n. sp. 1 and n. sp. 2). In general, more species were found in February (summer) than March and November. The cropping system (soybean) had the lowest abundance and species richness in relation to other sites, although in the young and old forests no earthworms were found on some sample dates. Given the several new species found in this small reserve, and the relatively few sites studied thus far in the Campos Gerais, further efforts are needed to adequately characterize the earthworm fauna of the region, from which many other species are expected.

TI  - Assessment of the ecotoxicity of extracts from sugarcane bagasse biochars activated with zinc chloride
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar derived from the pyrolysis of biomass is recognized for its carbon sequestration capacity. By adding physical or chemical activation steps, its properties can be enhanced, resulting in activated or modified biochar. However, investigating the possible toxic effects for safer application is necessary. In this study, we aimed to assess the ecotoxicological effects of extracts from biochars prepared from sugarcane bagasse activated with zinc chloride and heat treated at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 degrees C. Using Artemia salina as an indicator of toxicity, we observed variation in mortality ranging from 27.5 % to 100 % as the temperature varied between 1000 and 300 degrees C. The leachate from the sample prepared at 300 degrees C, which had the highest zinc content, presented an LC50 of 0.53 w/v. Phytotoxicity tests with Lactuca sativa revealed that extracts from biochars prepared at lower temperatures presented greater phytotoxicity, with reductions in relative germination, relative average radicle growth and the germination index. These results highlight the need to assess the ecotoxicological risks of activated biochar with zinc chloride. The sensitivities of Artemia salina and Lactuca sativa are promising for detecting these effects, suggesting that they are effective approaches for assessing environmental safety. These findings not only broaden our understanding of the adverse effects of activated biochar but also guide safe and sustainable practices for its future application.

TI  - The effects of soil compaction and fertility on a threatened endemic palm species in a global conservation hotspot
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Butia eriospatha (Mart. ex Drude) Becc. is a subtropical endemic palm tree that occurs in the Southern Brazilian Highlands. A vast area of its natural habitat has been lost by land-use changes, placing the species at high risk of extinction. Here, we investigated how environmental variables impact the structure of B. eriospatha populations. We randomly allocated 14,100 x 100 m plots, where all palms had the diameter at breast height (dbh) and the total height (th) measured. In the same plots, we collected data on edaphic, topographic, and land-use variables. The data were analysed by frequency histograms, factor analysis of mixed data, and regression trees. B. eriospatha's size class frequencies tended towards a normal distribution, with few small individuals. We found that plots with flatter terrain had more compacted soils. The structure and biometrics traits of B. eriospatha's populations were affected by the interaction between soil compaction and fertility. We conclude that sites with lower fertility and more compacted soils showed populations with lower abundance and basal area, and smaller individuals. Sustainable practices of soil management are required to prevent the species from becoming locally extinct.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping Agroforestry Aboveground Biomass in the Brazilian Amazon Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was similar to 10% on average and up to similar to 30% at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Maximization of fixed carbon content in biochar applied to carbon sequestration
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the emission of carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming due to greenhouse effect. Researchers around the world have been studying to find viable solutions to the problem. Biochar is among the latest proposals for mitigating climate change due to its simplicity and efficiency. Therefore, this study aimed to maximize the fixed carbon content in the production of biochar. Seven treatments were analysed with pyrolysis temperature of 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 degrees C. From the production yield and fixed carbon content, the gravimetric yield factor was calculated for each treatment, which indicates the amount of fixed carbon. The pyrolysis temperature of 300 degrees C showed the greatest gravimetric yield factor, reaching 0.22672 C/biochar.

TI  - Can short-term pasture management increase C balance in the Atlantic Rainforest?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have shown the importance of different pasture management practices on C storage and the reduction of CO2-C emissions in tropical conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine short-term changes in C pools and C balance from different pasture management practices established in the Atlantic Rainforest. A field study was carried out in Alegre, ES, Brazil from September 2013 to August 2014 to investigate the first-year effect of pasture management practices on a Udult clayey soil. The different pasture management practices studied included the following: control (CON), chiseled (CHI), fertilized (FER), burned (BUR), integrated with crop-livestock (iCL) systems, and plowed and harrowed (PH). Monthly disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken at two different layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.20 m) for chemical, physical, and organic matter characterization. C inputs monitored in aboveground pools included plant aerial parts and litter, and belowground pools included roots and soil C stocks. C outputs monitored were CO2-C emissions, erosion water, and sediment. C balance was considered the difference between inputs and outputs in each treatment during four seasons. The spring and summer seasons had a strong influence on C inputs and outputs where there is significant difference between spring and summer, while the autumn and winter seasons had less influence. All pasture management practices exhibited positive C balance after 1 year. High values of C balance were verified in pastures fertilized (FER) (53.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Intermediate C balance was found in the burned (BUR) (40.84 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), traditional control (CON) (40.31 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), and in the plowing and harrowing (PH) (40.02 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) management practices. The practices of chiseled (40.00 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) (59.06 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) resulted in low C balance.

TI  - Insights into regional patterns of Amazonian forest structure, diversity, and dominance from three large terra-firme forest dynamics plots
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze forest structure, diversity, and dominance in three large-scale Amazonian forest dynamics plots located in Northwestern (Yasuni and Amacayacu) and central (Manaus) Amazonia, to evaluate their consistency with prevailing wisdom regarding geographic variation and the shape of species abundance distributions, and to assess the robustness of among-site patterns to plot area, minimum tree size, and treatment of morphospecies. We utilized data for 441,088 trees (DBH >= 1 cm) in three 25-ha forest dynamics plots. Manaus had significantly higher biomass and mean wood density than Yasuni and Amacayacu. At the 1-ha scale, species richness averaged 649 for trees > 1 cm DBH, and was lower in Amacayacu than in Manaus or Yasuni; however, at the 25-ha scale the rankings shifted, with Yasuni<Amacayacu<Manaus. Within each site, Fisher's alpha initially increased with plot area to 1-10 ha, and then showed divergent patterns at larger areas depending on the site and minimum size. Abundance distributions were better fit by lognormal than by logseries distributions. Results were robust to the treatment of morphospecies. Overall, regional patterns in Amazonian tree species diversity vary with the spatial scale of analysis and the minimum tree size. The minimum area to capture local diversity is 2 ha for trees >= 1 cm DBH, or >= 10 ha for trees C10 cm DBH. The underlying species abundance distribution for Amazonian tree communities is lognormal, consistent with the idea that the rarest species have not yet been sampled. Enhanced sampling intensity is needed to fill the still large voids we have in plant diversity in Amazon forests.

TI  - Influence of soil management for soybean production under microbial diversity in amazon soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical Amazon has a unique biodiversity that has been affected by the development of pastures and economically important crops, such as soybeans. In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

TI  - NITROGEN DYNAMICS IN SOIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. I - FLUX OF INORGANIC NITROGEN (NH4<SUP>+</SUP> AND NO3<SUP>-</SUP>)
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural systems the N-NH4+ and N-NO3- contents is significantly affected by soil management. This study investigated the dynamics of inorganic nitrogen (N; NH4+ and NO3-) in an experimental evaluation of soil management systems (SMSs) adopted in 1988 at the experimental station of the ABC Foundation in Ponta Grossa, in the Central South region of the State of Parana. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in N-NH4+ and N-NO3- flux in the surface layer of a Red Latosol arising from SMSs over a 12-month period. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design in split plots, in three replications. The plots consisted of the following SMSs: 1) conventional tillage (CT); 2) minimum tillage (MT); 3) no-tillage with chisel plow every three years (NTCH); and 4) continuous no-tillage (CNT). To evaluate the dynamics of inorganic N, the subplots represented samplings (11 sampling times, T-1 - T-11). The ammonium N (N-NH4+) and nitric N (N-NO3-) contents were higher in systems with reduced tillage (MT and NTCH) and without tillage (CNT) than in the CT system. In the period from October 2003 to February 2004, the N-NH4+ was higher than the N-NO3- soil content. Conversely, in the period from May 2004 to July 2004, the N-NO3- was higher than the N-NH4+ content. The greatest fluctuation in the N-NH4+ and N-NO3- contents occurred in the 0-2.5 cm layer, and the highest peak in the N-NH4+ and N-NO3- concentrations occurred after the surface application of N. Both N-NH4+ and NNO3- were strongly correlated with the soil organic C content, which indicated that these properties vary together in the system.

TI  - A step to disentangle diversity patterns in Uruguayan grasslands: Climatic seasonality, novel land-uses, and landscape context drive diversity of ground flora
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - South American grasslands contain extraordinary biodiversity and play a central role in the subsistence of regional agroecosystems. In recent decades, afforestation, followed by the soybean planting boom, have led to drastic land-use changes at the expense of grasslands. Impacts on local biodiversity have remained understudied. We explored the taxonomic richness and ss-diversity of plants of ground layer (excluding trees and shrubs) at different land uses, its interplay at regional scale with environmental heterogeneity, and at local scale with novel land cover types and landscape configurations. We conducted correlation, principal component, NDMS, and SDR analysis to explore variation of taxonomic richness, richness difference, replacement, and similarity of ground flora as response to environmental filters and land use change across Uruguay. We surveyed 160 plots distributed in 10 land cover types, that is, closed and open native forests, different grasslands, crops, orchards, and timber plantations. We observed overlaying regional patterns driven by seasonality of temperature and precipitation, and land cover shaping taxonomic richness at local scale. Landscape configuration affects diversity patterns of native ground flora, which seems to be sustained mainly by the "old growth grassland" species pool. Taxonomic richness of native species decreases with an increase of distance to grassland. Crops and grasslands harbor a higher number of native species in the ground flora than native forests and timber plantations. The introduction of exotics is driven mostly by crops or highly modified pastures. Diversity patterns only partially reflect the ecoregion concept. Expanding the perspective from conservation in purely natural ecosystems to measures conserving species richness in human-modified landscapes is a powerful tool against species loss in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Searching for food in a concrete jungle: feeding ecology of a Psittacine assemblage (Aves, Psittacidae) in a major Amazonian city
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficient use of food resources is a precondition for wild species ' survival in urban environments. The feeding ecology of animals in tropical cities, however, remains poorly investigated. Here we study the feeding ecology of parrots in Manaus, a major Amazonian city, and compare the results with a parrot assemblage living in undisturbed habitats. We recorded 203 feeding bouts from eight parrot species, which consumed parts of 51 plant species. Parrot diets were dominated by native palm species (Arecaceae). Exotic plants, however, constituted an important portion of the diet of some parrots. Levin's indices, a measure of food niche width, varied from 0.40 to 0.83, indicating an overall tendency to generalist diets. Diet overlap between species was small, indicating broad resource partitioning between members of the assemblage. The diversity of plants consumed in the natural environment was greater than in the urban environment (71 species vs. 52). However, the diversity of plants consumed was similar for parrot species recorded both in natural and urban environments, indicating that occupation of the city does not imply an impoverishment in parrot diets. Creation of municipal protected areas and increasing the city afforestation would provide complementary strategies for Manaus parrot conservation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this review was to (i) acknowledge structural advantages of natural products (NPs) for designing therapeutic drugs; (ii) emphasize how wildlife conservation is socially and economically necessary for scientific and commercial progress in Brazilian regions; and (iii) show how decisions by governmental regulations exert damaging effects on safeguarding of biodiversity. Natural products (NPs) from animals (e.g.: bufadienolides as marinobufagin), plants (diterpenes: casearin X and paclitaxel; triterpenes: betulinic acid) and microorganisms (depsipeptides: geodiamolides; antraciclines: doxorubicin) are the main source of oral drugs and have innate advantages for enteral and parenteral drug design, synthesis and combinational chemistry using novel techniques, including green chemistry. NPs possess high chemical diversity, binding flexibility to biological targets, chiral centers, aliphatic systems, hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors, and/or heteroatoms, and broad-spectrum pharmacological properties, including against malign disorders. Nonetheless, all Brazilian biomes and connected ecosystems have been systemically threatened since 2019 by the following fire, deforestation, monocultures, cattle raising, mining and/or oil spills mainly as consequence of financial cuts in key institutions which oversee environmental stability for terrestrial and marine Brazilian fauna and flora. Nevertheless, natural chemical entities, broad traditional knowledge on agrobiodiversity, fishing, fire management, and pioneering processes of economic interest play a vital role for "Science of Biodiversity," which arises as business bioeconomy opportunities to convert Brazil into a self-sufficient country for production of pharmaceutical supplies, cosmeticsand foods. Hence, Brazil needs sustainable development projects supported by government and scientific input if one wishes to use the chemical and biological biodiversity to treat individuals and improve the quality of life.

AB  - Initially, this work deals with the concept of multifunctionality of agriculture and discusses the international debate around this issue, which sets two groups of countries in opposite sides. Then, this work lists the roles played by the family farming in Brazil, defending the view point that Brazil does meet the agriculture environmental role, by allocating subsidized funds to family farmers in two Lines of credit from the National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming - Pronaf, dedicated, mainly, to agroecology and agroforestry. These lines of credit focus on the sustainable use of agroecossystems and forestry resources. Through the years of the existing Program its credit policies have shown low performance maybe in spite of the Draconian policies of evaluation/analysis made by the financial analyzers to approve the projects based on the arguments of lack for models of agroforestry systems production and also lack for ecological crops systems that show acknowledge technical and financial rates. On the other hand, the projects supported by the Agroforestry and Agroecology Pronaf have shown to be a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil, once they incorporate ecological principles based on the species conservation and restoration of ecosystem functions of natural resources.

TI  - Particulate organic matter in soil under different management systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of the no-till planting system (NTS) and pasture (e. g. brachiaria grass, Urochloa sp.) for livestock production constitutes a crop-livestock integration (CLI) system. CLI systems significantly increase the total organic carbon (TOC) content of soil and the particulate organic carbon (POC) of soil organic matter (SOM). The present study evaluated TOC and the granulometric fractions of SOM under different management systems in a Cerrado area in the state of Goias. Two areas applying crop rotation were evaluated, one using CLI (corn/brachiaria grass/bean/cotton/soybean planted sequentially) and the other NTS (sunflower/pearl millet/soybean/corn planted sequentially). A third area covered with natural Cerrado vegetation (Cerradao) served as a reference to determine original soil conditions. Soil was randomly sampled at 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm. The TOC, POC, and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) were assessed, and POC and MOC stocks calculated. The CLI system resulted in greater TOC levels than NTS (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm). Compared with the Cerradao, CLI areas exhibited higher stocks of TOC (at 5-10 and 10-20 cm) and POC (at 0-40 cm). Results obtained for TOC and POC fractions show that land management with CLI was more efficient in increasing SOM than NTS. Moreover, when compared with NTS, the CLI system provided better POC stratification.

TI  - Cotton production systems in the Brazilian Cerrado: The impact of soil attributes on field-scale yield
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different cotton (Gossipium hirsutum)-based management systems in the Brazilian Cerrado on soil's physical and chemical quality, using multivariate analysis techniques. The experiment was conducted in areas of cotton production in the state of Mato Grosso, located in the Cerrado biome and Cerrado/Amazon ecotone. Soil samples were obtained from 1162 plots of 10 ha each to evaluate the effects of cotton production systems. These plots were distributed in the main production sub region of the state of Mato Grosso. Soil samples were obtained in the 0 - 20 cm layer to evaluate chemical quality, carbon and nitrogen content, texture and bulk density. Seed cotton yield was estimated by harvesting 4 rows, each of 5 m length. Clay contents varied from a low of 54 to a high of 778 g kg(-1). Six cotton production clusters were established by means of a dendrogram. Principal component analysis explained almost 77% of all data variability, highlighting the effect of the evaluated soil attributes and altitude on cotton yields. The highest soil carbon (59.0 Mg ha(-1)) and nitrogen (3.5 Mg ha(-1)) stocks were observed in the clusters that used conservation agriculture practices. Clusters characterized by a high productivity were observed in regions with altitude of > 600 m, but without any common soil parameters. Cotton production areas with the longest cultivation periods were characterized by having the highest soil fertility. The highest yields (4195 kg ha(-1)) of cotton in the state of Mato Grosso were obtained in regions with higher alludes, associated with the use of conservation practices.

T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Study of the dynamics and distribution of lepidopteran defoliators is important because some of them are major pests of eucalyptus. More than 3,000,000 ha of eucalyptus are now planted in Brazil even though the genus is not native there. The goal of this study was to document the frequency and constancy indexes of lepidopteran pests of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden (Myrtaceae) collected with Slight traps (replicates) in different habitats. The first and second traps were installed in a eucalyptus plantation at 400 and 200 m, respectively, from the interface with a native vegetation area (Atlantic Rainforest); the third in the interface and the fourth and the fifth in native vegetation at 200 and 400 in, respectively, from the interface zone. The most frequent primary pest species were Stenalcidia grosica Schaus, 1901 (Geometridae) and Thyrinteina leucoceraea Rindge, 1961 (Geometridae) with greater frequencies in the eucalyptus plantation at 400 and 200 in from the interface with the native vegetation. In the native vegetation at 200 m from the interface Oxydia vesulia Cramer, 1779 (Geometridae) (33.33%) was the most frequently collected primary pest species, and in the interface zone, Eupseudosoma involuta Sepp, 1855 (16.27%), and Eupseudosoma aberrans Schaus, 1905 (Arctiidae) (15.22%) were the most frequently collected primary pest species. Native vegetation areas of Atlantic Rainforest are more spatially heterogeneous and abundant in host plant species than eucalypt plantations and the high level of species diversity within native vegetation helps to provide natural biological control of herbivorous insects in nearby areas reforested with eucalyptus species.

TI  - Diversity of filamentous fungi communities in the soils of agroecological crop polycultures and the Atlantic Rain Forest
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study compared filamentous fungi communities from a Consortium of Plants (COP), Agroforestry Systems (AFS), and the Atlantic Rain Forest (ATF) in Northeastern Brazil to determine how different land uses influence the general parameters of the edaphic mycobiota. Physicochemical soil properties, microbial respiration rate, and biological diversity of the fungal communities were assessed. The COP showed a 36% similarity to the AFS that have greater plant diversity. Despite the low similarity, the mycobiota of both systems consisted of generalist fungi that act on the decomposition of organic matter, in addition to species with the potential to promote plant growth and control other microorganisms. The physicochemical properties of COP and AFS were more similar to each other (pH 5.4 and 5.3, P 16.3 and 13.7, K 0.3 and 0.3, Al 0.2 and 0.2, BS 34.0 and 31.0, m 5.6% and 4.0% in first collection and 9.3% and 14% in second collection, respectively) than ATF (pH 4.5, P 2.7, K 0.4, Al 1.1, BS 19.1, m 27.3% in first collection and 47.3% in second collection). These data reinforce the importance of crop diversification in agroecological soil management and suggest further research on filamentous fungi communities as soil quality indicators.

TI  - Land-use change and soil type are drivers of fungal and archaeal communities in the Pampa biome
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that both land-use change and soil type are responsible for the major changes in the fungal and archaeal community structure and functioning of the soil microbial community in Brazilian Pampa biome. Soil samples were collected at sites with different land-uses (native grassland, native forest, Eucalyptus and Acacia plantation, soybean and watermelon field) and in a typical toposequence in Pampa biome formed by Paleudult, Albaqualf and alluvial soils. The structure of soil microbial community (archaeal and fungal) was evaluated by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and soil functional capabilities were measured by microbial biomass carbon and metabolic quotient. We detected different patterns in microbial community driven by land-use change and soil type, showing that both factors are significant drivers of fungal and archaeal community structure and biomass and microbial activity. Fungal community structure was more affected by land-use and archaeal community was more affected by soil type. Irrespective of the land-use or soil type, a large percentage of operational taxonomic unit were shared among the soils. We accepted the hypothesis that both land-use change and soil type are drivers of archaeal and fungal community structure and soil functional capabilities. Moreover, we also suggest the existence of a soil microbial core.

TI  - Cover Crop Effects Increasing Carbon Storage in a Subtropical No-Till Sandy Acrisol
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term (8-year) effects of summer (Mucuna spp.) and winter cover crops (Avena strigosa + Vicia sativa and Lolium multiflorum + Vicia sativa) in maize-based cropping systems on the total, particulate, and mineral-associated soil carbon (C) stocks in the 0- to 0.2-m layer of a no-till South Brazilian Acrisol (87gkg-1 clay) were evaluated. Annual C sequestration rates and the carbon management index (CMI) were calculated taking a fallow/maize (F/M) system as reference. A greater average C sequestration rate (0.68 Mg ha-1yr-1) and greater C lability (particulate C/mineral-associated C) were observed in the soil under the Mucuna system, and this was related to the higher biomass input in comparison to the winter cover crop systems. These cropping system effects on amount and lability of soil C were summarized through the CMI. The results highlight the potential of C retention in soils under warm and humid subtropical climate through the adoption of high C input summer cover crops in no-till production systems aimed at further improvement in soil and environmental quality.

TI  - Soil Chemical Quality in Integrated Production Systems with the Presence of Native and Exotic Tree Components in the Brazilian Eastern Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation systems involving trees enhance the sustainability of tropical soils. However, little is known on the effect of integrated systems with native and exotic trees on soil chemical quality in the eastern Amazon. We aimed to measure changes in soil chemical quality in integrated production systems in Pindare-Mirim, Maranh & atilde;o, Brazil. This study was carried out in 2017 and 2018, evaluating (i) perennial pasture; (ii) crop-livestock-forest integration-I (CLFI-I)-eucalyptus rows interspersed with maize + Urochloa brizantha intercropping; (iii) CLFI-II-babassu palm trees (Attalea speciosa Mart.) with maize + Megathyrsus maximus intercropping; and (iv) maize + M. maximus intercropping. Soil chemical attributes at depths of 0.00-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m, 0.20-0.30 m, and 0.30-0.50 m, forage productivity, and soil cover were evaluated. CLFI-II promoted the highest soil organic matter concentration in topsoil and highest pH, lowest Al3+ levels, and potential acidity (H+Al) at all soil depths. Soil under pasture showed the highest N, K+, Ca2+ concentrations, sum of bases, and cation exchange capacity. Changes in CLFI-II are associated with the babassu palm's ability to modulate the surrounding environment, giving the species a competitive advantage in anthropic environments. The time of adoption is crucial for improving soil fertility in the Brazilian eastern Amazon. Sustainable production systems in the region must comply with long-term management plans.

This study evaluated the ecological improvement of revegetated land at the reclamation sub-areas (RSAs) of former limestone quarries in Tuban, East Java, Indonesia. The RSAs were coded as RSA 2010, RSA 2014, and RSA 2016 which represented the initial year of revegetation as well as the reclamation soil-material, namely the rejected soil-products, topsoil, and spoils, respectively. Soil insects were collected from ten sampling plots at each RSA using pitfall traps. The data of arthropods were analyzed to describe the community structure by determining the Shannon Diversity Index (H'), Simpson's index (D), Sorensen's similarity and Shannon evenness index (E). The soil organic carbon (SOC) content from the soil composites was analyzed according to the Walkley and Black method. The results showed that SOC value at RSA 2010 (1.851[plus or minus] 0.38%) was higher than that at SRA 2014 (1.694[plus or minus] 0.29%) and SRA 2016 (0.947[plus or minus] 0.10%). There were 18 families found from eight orders of soil insects (Coleoptera, Diplura, Diptera, Entognatha, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera, and Orthoptera) and one order from terrestrial Crustacea i. e., Isopoda, family Tylidae. The ecological indices of RSA 2014 (H'=1.15; D=0.47; E=0.61) and RSA 2016 (H'=1,19; D=0.47; E=0.57) were higher than those of RSA 2010 (H'=0,61; D=0.71; E=0.43). The Pearson analysis indicated moderate negative correlation (r=0.55) between soil arthropod diversity index and SOC. The diversity of soil arthropods at reclaimed area indicated that the reclamation was successful. Based on the study, we recommend that reclamation is done using mine spoil or topsoil rather than rejected soil products.

TI  - No effect of Rainforest Alliance cocoa certification on shade cover and bird species richness in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) and certification are promoted to enhance sustainable agricultural practices, but environmental outcomes of cocoa certification remain understudied. We selected 31 Rainforest Alliance (RA) certified and 31 non-certified cocoa plantations in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, Indonesia, from a previous socioeconomic survey and assessed vegetation structure, soil fertility, as well as bird species richness. Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, GLMMs and NMDS, we did not find certified plantations to have a higher shade tree diversity, shade tree basal area, and soil fertility. Bird species richness was significantly higher in certified plantations (p = 0.03), but the observed effect on bird species richness became statistically insignificant after controlling for elevation and plantation age in the GLMM. Current RA shade criteria are low, and potentially not sufficiently enforced, limiting RA potential to enhance biodiversity habitat. Certified farmers more frequently used improved farming techniques and received training; hence, certification might provide socioeconomic benefits to farmers while we found environmental outcomes of certification to be limited. Further research is needed to draw robust conclusions on VSS potential to enhance sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Plant roots fuel tropical soil animal communities
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Belowground life relies on plant litter, while its linkage to living roots had long been understudied, and remains unknown in the tropics. Here, we analysed the response of 30 soil animal groups to root trenching and litter removal in rainforest and plantations in Sumatra, and found that roots are similarly important to soil fauna as litter. Trenching effects were stronger in soil than in litter, with an overall decrease in animal abundance in rainforest by 42% and in plantations by 30%. Litter removal little affected animals in soil, but decreased the total abundance by 60% in rainforest and rubber plantations but not in oil palm plantations. Litter and root effects on animal group abundances were explained by body size or vertical distribution. Our study quantifies principle carbon pathways in soil food webs under tropical land use, providing the basis for mechanistic modelling and ecosystem-friendly management of tropical soils.

AB  - The edaphic macrofauna plays important role in the cycling of nutrients and improves the chemical and physical properties of soil. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biodiversity of edaphic macrofauna in area with of coffee and eucalyptus crops and riparian forest, Campos Gerais - MG. The treatments consisted of edaphic macrofauna samples in different plant covers (coffee, eucalyptus and riparian forest) in winter and summer epochs. In the leaf litter was observed the presence of arachnids, coleopteras and hymenopteras in different areas and epochs. On the soil, all systems of management and epochs, was observed the presence of oligochaetas, being found so prevalent in the riparian forest. The greatest wealth of orders and individuals per square meter were found in summer in riparian forest soil. The best of Shannon index (H') was found in the soil of the forest and in the leaf litter of the coffee crop in winter and summer respectively. The index of Pielou (J') showed the best results in different soil management systems in winter period. In the leaf litter, the Pie lou index showed good performance in different areas and epochs. The riparian forest is the area of highest biodiversity of soil macrofauna.

TI  - New Insights on Environmental Occurrence of Pathogenic Fungi Based on Metagenomic Data from Brazilian Cerrado Biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and majorly contributes to the country's grain production. Previous studies on soil metagenomics from the Cerrado revealed an outstanding microbial diversity. In this study, the abundance of pathogenic fungi was analyzed using metagenomic sequences of the Cerrado soils under native vegetation, and under agriculture with no-tillage and conventional tillage. In total, 128,627 sequences of fungi were identified, with 43,439 representing pathogenic fungi and were distributed as follows: native 17,301 (40%), no-tillage 13,780 (32%), and conventional tillage 12,358 (28%). We identified 41 pathogenic fungal species associated with human and animal infections. The data analysis revealed that the native soils had a higher relative abundance of fungal sequences, similar to pathogenic species sequences, in relation to the total eukaryotic sequences, than the conventional tillage and no-tillage treatments, which observed a reduction in fungal abundance because of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Combining protected areas with natural forest timber concessions may sustain larger forest landscapes than is possible via protected areas alone. However, the role of timber concessions in maintaining natural forest remains poorly characterized. An estimated 57% (303,525 km(2)) of Kalimantan's land area (532,100 km(2)) was covered by natural forest in 2000. About 14,212 km(2) (4.7%) had been cleared by 2010. Forests in oil palm concessions had been reduced by 5,600 km(2) (14.1%), while the figures for timber concessions are 1,336 km(2) (1.5%), and for protected forests are 1,122 km(2) (1.2%). These deforestation rates explain little about the relative performance of the different land use categories under equivalent conversion risks due to the confounding effects of location. An estimated 25% of lands allocated for timber harvesting in 2000 had their status changed to industrial plantation concessions in 2010. Based on a sample of 3,391 forest plots (161 km; 100 ha), and matching statistical analyses, 2000-2010 deforestation was on average 17.6 ha lower (95% C. I.: -22.3 ha--212.9 ha) in timber concession plots than in oil palm concession plots. When location effects were accounted for, deforestation rates in timber concessions and protected areas were not significantly different (Mean difference: 0.35 ha; 95% C. I.: -0.002 ha-0.7 ha). Natural forest timber concessions in Kalimantan had similar ability as protected areas to maintain forest cover during 2000-2010, provided the former were not reclassified to industrial plantation concessions. Our study indicates the desirability of the Government of Indonesia designating its natural forest timber concessions as protected areas under the IUCN Protected Area Category VI to protect them from reclassification.

TI  - Modelling the long-term impacts of selective logging on genetic diversity and demographic structure of four tropical tree species in the Amazon forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last three decades, Amazon tropical forests have experienced high rates of deforestation, both by clearing for agriculture and by logging. In this study, we use computer simulations to examine the potential effects of forest logging on genetic diversity and demographic recovery (basal area development) of four neotropical tree species over a time frame reflecting multiple logging events. The study species, Bagassa guianensis Aubl., Hymenaea courbaril L., Manilkara huberi (Ducke) Chevalier, and Symphonia globulifera L.f., are all taxa which are commonly exploited for timber in the Brazilian Amazon. The simulations were parameterized using empirical data from field studies in the Tapajos National Forest, Para State, Brazil, including genotypes at microsatellite loci, demography, ecology and growth for each species. Eight scenarios, combining two different cutting cycles and two minimum cutting diameters, were examined for each of the four species. The scenarios represent the actual forest practices used in Brazil and French Guiana (cutting diameter 45 and 60 cm, and cutting cycle of 30 and 65 years, respectively). Logging scenarios were applied for six cutting cycles, and final genetic and demographic data were compared to baseline data from corresponding control scenarios. At the end of the simulated period the basal area was strongly reduced under all conditions in B. guianensis, H. courbaril, and M. huberi. In only two scenarios was a species able to recover its basal area following logging (S. globulifera with both 45- and 60-cm cutting diameters under a 65-year cutting cycle). In the logging scenarios, all species showed a loss of alleles and genotypes and an increased genetic distance (calculated between each population at the start and the end of the simulations). These effects were higher under the most intensive logging cycles (30 years, 45 cm). However, effective number of alleles, expected and observed heterozygosities, and the fixation index were little affected by the logging simulations. Over all, we conclude that, even under very optimistic conditions for growth and recruitment, current logging practices are not sustainable in terms of basal area. Our simulations show that different species respond differently to logging, both demographically and genetically. No single set of logging parameters can be applied to the forest as a whole. Rather, forest management practices must be species-specific, taking into account not only growth parameters but also ecological and reproductive variables, in order to move toward long-term forest sustainability.

M3  - Article
AB  - An ethnobotanical study was executed in the rural community of the Municipality of "Rio Formoso", starting from the forest inventory accomplished in an Atlantic Forest remnant adjacent to the studied community. Using the methodology of quantitative ethnobotany allied to the ecological parameters (richness, relative frequency, relative density, relative dominance and importance value index) the following results were obtained: 42 inventoried species gathered in 26 families, presented from 1 to 27 means of use for the community. The largest use of the plants is related to obtaining wood in order to be used in house building, firewood production and charcoal. The largest use value was attributed to the Vouacapoua virgilioides (Kunth) Kuntze. The most frequent species were Tapirira guianensis Aubl. (Anacardiaceae), Thyrsodium schomburgkianum Benth. (Anacardiaceae), Schefflera morototoni (Aubl.) Maguire, Steyem. & Frodin (Araliaceae) and Dialium guianense (Aubl.) Sandwith. (Leg-Caesalpinioideae).

TI  - Long-term effects of no-tillage on dynamic soil physical properties in a Rhodic Ferrasol in Parana, Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-tillage has been adopted worldwide as a strategy to reduce the negative effects of soil erosion in conventional tillage. However, no-tillage can lead to over-compaction of the soil, which can have detrimental effects on soil structure and on crop yield. The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil physical functionality of a Rhodic Ferrasol under long-term no-tillage. The following physical properties were measured: dry bulk density (Db), total porosity (Pt) and macroporosity as well as saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) and intrinsic air permeability (K-a). Physical quality of the soil was also evaluated by the S index at each depth increment. The study was carried out in a Rhodic Ferrasol under a 14-year old, no-tillage system in Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 0-0.10, 0.20-0.30, 0.40-0.50, and 0.60-0.70 m. The soil properties such as dry bulk density, total porosity and macroporosity showed the presence of a denser layer at a depth of 0.20-0.30 in. The Db and Pt values in this layer were significantly different from the other layers. However, the values of 1.23 Mg m(-3) for Db, 0.52 m(3) m(-3) for Pt, and 0.17 m(3) m(-3) for macroporosity were all still adequate for the growth and development of roots at this layer. The values of K-sat and K-a were higher at the surface layer than deeper layers. The lowest values were around 80 and 70% in comparison with surface, respectively to the depths of 0.40-0.50. and 0.60-0.70 in K-sat and K-a values were 7.79 x 10(-5), 2.76 x 10(-5), 1.58 x 10(-5), and 1.91 x 10(-5) m s(-1), and K-a values were 3.70 x 10(-11), 2.04 x 10(-11), 7.69 x 10(-12), and 1.10 x 10(-11) m(2) for the depths of 0-0.10, 0.20-0.30, 0.40-0.50, and 0.60-0.70 m, respectively. This demonstrated that better conditions for the exchange of gases and water existed in the layers above 0.30 m. The S index indicated that the soil had good structure in all layers studied, with values above 0.035, but that a small increase in Db in the 0.20-0.30 m layer could lead to deterioration of the soil structural quality. The long-term use of no-tillage resulted in increases of organic carbon and pore connectivity in the surface layer, providing functionality in the soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Utami S, Triwidodo H, Pudjianto, Rauf A, Haneda NF. 2018. Population dynamics of Arthroschista hilaralis pest and its parasitoid diversity in various jabon (Anthocephalus cadamba) cropping patterns in South Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 239-245. Jabon (Anthocephalus cadamba), a native tree species in Indonesia exhibit natural distribution, spreading over an enormous area in this region. In South Sumatra, jabon has long been cultivated in both communities and industrial plantation forests. Arthroschista hilaralis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is the most damaging insect pest of jabon in South Sumatra. This study analyzed the population dynamics of A. hilaralis in jabon monoculture and two agroforestry systems, and assessed the diversity of the pest parasitoids and their parasitism level on A. hilaralis. Our results showed that planting systems, climatic factors, and the presence of parasitoids could significantly affect the population dynamics of A. hilaralis; its mean population density was highest in monocultures plantation during the rainy season compared with population densities in agroforestry systems. Three parasitoids species attacking A. hilaralis were found in these agroforestry systems, including Phanerotoma sp., Apanteles sp. and Brachymeria sp., while only one species (Apanteles sp.) was found in a monoculture. The rate of parasitization of A. hilaralis within agroforestry systems was higher than in monocultures, and the level of larval parasitization by Apanteles sp. in the agroforestry system was higher in instar 1 than in other larval stages.

TI  - Land use, tillage, texture and organic matter stock and composition in tropical and subtropical Brazilian soils
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the influence of land use change, tillage system and soil texture on organic carbon (C) stocks and on organic matter composition of tropical and subtropical soils from Brazil at four long-term experiments (11-25 years) based on fine- and coarse-textured soils. Soil samples were collected from the 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm layers of conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) plots, and of the adjoining soil under native vegetation (NV) of Cerrado (tropical) or grassland (subtropical). Conversion of NV to CT resulted in losses of 7-29% of the original C stock of 0-20 cm; conversion to NT increased this C stock by 0-12% compared with CT. Organic matter composition of the 0-5 cm layer, assessed by solid state CPMAS-(13)C-NMR, ESR and laser induced fluorescence spectroscopies, was affected by land use and tillage systems. Conversion of NV to CT decreased O-alkyl and increased aromatic, carbonyl, aromatic/O-alkyl ratio, free radicals concentration and fluorescence signal. The opposite trend was observed when NT replaced CT. The relative losses and gains of C and qualitative changes resulting from land use and tillage were less evident in fine- than in coarse-textured soils, suggesting a greater resistance and a smaller resilience of fine- compared with coarse-textured soils. The direct relation between increase in C stock and increase in potentially labile moieties (e.g. O-alkyl) and the decrease in more recalcitrant moieties (e.g. aromatics) in NT soils suggests that spatial inaccessibility by aggregates is playing a major role, compared with selective preservation, in promoting C accumulation in NT soils.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF LAND USE AND SOIL MANAGEMENT ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXISOL IN SOUTHEAST BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils of the tropics are prone to a decrease in quality after conversion from native forest (FO) to a conventional tillage system (CT). However, the adoption of no-tillage (NT) and complex crop rotations may improve soil structural quality. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the physical properties of an Oxisol under FO, CT, and three summer crop sequences in NT: continuous corn (NTcc), continuous soybean (NTcs), and a soybean/corn rotation (NTscr). Both NT and CT decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) content, SOC stock, water stable aggregates (WSA), geometric mean diameter (GMD), soil total porosity (TP), macroporosity (MA), and the least limiting water range (LLWR). However they increased soil bulk density (BD) and tensile strength (TS) of the aggregates when compared to soil under FO. Soil under NT had higher WSA, GMD, BD, TS and microporosty, but lower TP and MA than soil under CT. Soil under FO did not attain critical values for the LLWR, but the lower limit of the LLWR in soils under CT and NT was resistance to penetration (RP) for all values of BD, while the upper limit of field capacity was air-filled porosity for BD values greater than 1.46 (CT), 1.40 (NTscr), 1.42 (NTcc), and 1.41 (NTcs) kg dm(-3). Soil under NTcc and NTcs decreased RP even with the increase in BD because of the formation of biopores. Furthermore, higher critical BD was verified under NTcc (1.62 kg dm(-3)) and NTcs (1.57 kg dm(-3)) compared to NTscr and CT (1.53 kg dm(-3)).

TI  - The value of primary, secondary and plantation forests for Amazonian birds
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are rapidly expanding across tropical landscapes, yet we currently have a very poor understanding of the value of these human-dominated forest landscapes for biodiversity conservation. Mist netting, point counts and transect walks were used to compare the bird communities of these habitats and neighboring primary forest in north-east Brazilian Amazonia. The extensive spatial scale of plantations and second-growth in our study area enabled us to implement a robust replicated design, with survey plots approximately two to three orders of magnitude larger than most previous studies of land-use change in the tropics, thus minimising the influence of the surrounding landscape. Species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in Eucalyptus plantations, and community turnover between habitats was very high whether based upon matrices of relative abundance or species presence-absence data, and for both point count and mist net data. Monthly line-transect censuses conducted over an annual cycle showed an increase in the detection of canopy frugivores and seed predators during the peak of flower and fruit availability in primary forest, but failed to suggest that second-growth or Eucalyptus stands provide suitable foraging habitat at any time of the year. The conservation value of both secondary forest and plantations was low compared to conclusions from previous studies. Our results indicate that while large-scale reforestation of degraded land can increase regional levels of diversity, it is unlikely to conserve most primary forest species, such as understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores.

M3  - Article
AB  - Structure of soil nematode population under an organically managed crop in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Soil nematode communities were studied in four differents crop systems at the Integrated System of Agroecological Production. Soil samples were collected at four-month intervals during one year, with three replications for each location. Nematode communities were measured by the following parameters: family richness, Shannon-Weaner's index, Simpson's index, trophic diversity (T) and dominance index (Ig). These data were submitted to ANOVA statistical analysis at 5% level of Tukey's test. The population of bacterivores and herbivore nematodes was high in all areas. Omnivores were found in lower abundance in all systems. The highest diversity of nematode families was found on pasture. In forests, the values of richness and abundance were always lower but constant in time, suggesting an ecosystem of higher stability. Soil management induced the proliferation of bacterivores usually associated with higher decomposition rates of organic matter. Herbivores and bacterivores were dominant in all systems, suggesting it is important to have high root (for pasture) or high decomposition rates (for horticulture system). The relative distribution of trophic groups of soil nematodes proved to be a good way to determine the level of perturbation of ecosystems.

TI  - Grasslands bird and biodiversity conservation aligned with livestock production
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands bird and biodiversity conservation aligned with livestock production. The Southern Cone Grasslands comprise one of the richest grazing and agricultural areas in the world, and consequently have been heavily altered by livestock and crop production, such that the natural features of the landscape have substantially changed. Currently, habitat loss through afforestation, agriculture and grazing are the main threats to the birds of this biome. A total of 480 bird species occur in the grasslands of Rio Grande do Sul, including several globally threatened species such as Saffron-cowled Blackbird (Xanthopsar flavus), Marsh Seedeater (Sporophila palustris), Chestnut Seedeater (Sporophila cinnamomea) and Black-and-white Monjita (Xolmis dominicanus). The few protected areas created in the Southern Cone Grasslands lack effective implementation and management. The poor state of the protected areas system, plus the ever increasing threats across the landscape, lead to an urgent need for a grassland conservation plan to be developed with the productive sector. In 2004, the four BirdLife International Partners who share the Southern Cone Grasslands created the Alianza del Pastizal. This innovative initiative aims to improve ecosystem management in priority grasslands areas through sustainable and low-impact uses that maintain and enhance the biodiversity value of the grasslands ecosystems, and improve the economic and social development of landowners and rural communities. In 2007, the Alianza undertook a pilot survey in three different Apropampa ranches in the Bage and Lavras do Sul regions of Rio Grande do Sul to obtain a preliminary understanding of how the current cattle-raising techniques affect the bird and vegetation communities. A total of 144 species of birds were recorded in the three properties, including five globally threatened species. The vegetation surveys found a total of 106 native grasses and herbs in open areas, and an absence of the exotic invasive anonni grass (Eragrotis plana), which combined indicate the high quality of the natural grasslands. Some of the management techniques employed on the ranches led to overgrazing and trampling, jeopardizing the growth of tall grasses, which are important for a number of bird species. In addition, cattle trampling in marshy areas dominated by the sedge (Eryngium pandanifolium) can cause serious damage to the vegetation and consequently habitat modification and loss. In general, the Bage and Lavras do Sul regions held good quality natural grasslands and important populations of globally and regionally threatened birds. By making a few changes to the current management regimes, ranchers could make a significant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the region.

TI  - [Biodiversity in a carbon sink.]
T2  - Bois et Forets des Tropiques
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1998, Peugeot and the French Forestry Office (Office National des Forets - ONF) launched a carbon sink project in Brazil, in the north of the Mato Grosso. Planting began in 1999 over an area of 2 500 ha which had been used as pasture by the previous owner. The main objective of the plantation was to fix maximum quantities of carbon while preserving the area's biodiversity and local development potential. The species planted were mostly native and chosen for their success rates and their environmental and market value. Effects on the local environment are monitored as part of the project. A specific method was developed to monitor carbon flows by comparing the project's carbon budget with the budget in the reference scenario (which represents the situation had the project not taken place). As well as testing technical schemes for a plantation of mixed native species, the pilot project also provides opportunities for fieldwork on carbon sink monitoring methods as required under the Kyoto Protocol. The project does not aim to provide Peugeot with carbon credits, but should produce useful new data for other projects stemming from the Clean Development Mechanism.

TI  - Integrating farmers' views, field soil erosion assessment, and pot experiments to evaluate different agroforestry systems in Timor-Leste
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 75% of subsistence farmers in rural Timor-Leste face challenges from unsustainable land use practices, particularly slash-and-burn farming on degraded steep slopes. These practices contribute to soil erosion, and poor crop yields, ultimately leading to land and environmental degradation and food insecurity. Recently, agroforestry projects have aimed to improve land productivity and farmers' livelihoods, though their impact remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate these impacts through three research questions: (1) How do agroforestry interventions impact field crop performance and smallholder farmers' livelihoods? (2) What is the extent of farmer adoption of these interventions? (3) What is the effect of agroforestry interventions on soil physical and chemical characteristics? The study was conducted at the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) project site at Saraida, Quelicai, Baucau municipality, during the rainy season from December 2021 to April 2022. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 35 farmers involved in the project, alongside field assessments of soil erosion and pot experiments. The results showed that most farmers reported improved production and outcomes from growing trees and would like to replicate agroforestry systems, suggesting adoption likelihood due to the multiple benefits of agroforestry, including soil improvement, animal feed, fuelwood provision, and environmental and biodiversity sustainability. Measurements of soil loss and plant productivity confirmed the positive impact of agroforestry, reducing soil erosion by nearly 15 times compared to traditional fallow systems and improving crop growth and yields in both fallow and slash-and-mulch systems. This study provides essential baseline data and guidance for future farmland management in Timor-Leste.

TI  - From chocolate to palm oil: The future of Indonesia's cocoa plantations
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is the world's third largest cocoa producer, but production is decreasing since 2011. We revisited cocoa farmers for an environmental assessment in Luwu Timur, Sulawesi, 7 months after a socio-economic survey on cocoa certification outcomes and observed many cocoa plantations being converted into oil palm and maize. Including our field data as well as secondary data on commodity prices and yields, we outline reasons for cocoa conversion, potential consequences for biodiversity, and assess the future outlook for the Indonesian cocoa sector. Low cocoa productivity, volatile cocoa prices and higher revenue for oil palm, among others, drive land-use change. If shade trees are cut during cocoa conversion, it may have negative implications for biodiversity. Solutions to low soil fertility, omnipresent pests and diseases, and stable producer prices are needed to increase profitability of cocoa and prevent conversion of cocoa agroforests to oil palm monocultures.

T2  - Malayan Nature Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Danau Sentarum National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia is bordered on three sides by Iban settlements and the forests they manage. The forest management system practiced by an Iban community on the northeastern periphery of the reserve is described here. Iban agroforestry is based on two principal components: swidden cultivation, which creates a field-secondary forest mosaic and various kinds of preserved and managed forest. Iban hunt within these forests, and the species and numbers of animals they encounter are analysed here with respect to their exploitation of the agroforests and fields. The merits and constraints of this management system are discussed. Based on the data analysed here, this system appears to promote some degree of biodiversity conservation and may serve as a partial buffer zone around the nearby wildlife reserve.

TI  - Rare canopy species in communities within the Atlantic Coastal Forest in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rare species are one of the principal components of the species richness and diversity encountered in Dense Ombrophilous Tropical Forests. This study sought to analyze the rare canopy species within the Atlantic Coastal Forest in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Six different communities were examined: Dense Ombrophilous alluvial Forest; Dense sub-montane Ombrophilous Forest; Dense Montane Ombrophilous in Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira. In each area the vegetation was sampled within forty 10 x 25 m plots alternately distributed along a linear transect. All trees with DBH (1.3 m above ground level) a parts per thousand yen5 cm were sampled. The canopy was characterized using the allometric relationship between diameter and height, and included all trees with BDH a parts per thousand yen10 cm and height a parts per thousand yen10 m. A total of 64 families, 206 genera, and 542 species were sampled, of which 297 (54.8%) represented rare species (less than one individual per hectare). The percentage of rare species varied from 34 to 50% in each of the different communities sampled. A majority of these rare trees belonged to the Rosidae, and a smaller proportion to the Dilleniidae. It was concluded that there was no apparent pattern to rarity among families, that rarity was probably derived from a number of processes (such as gap formation), and that a great majority of the rare species sampled were consistently rare. This indicates that the restricted geographic distribution and high degree of endemism of many arboreal taxa justifies the conservation of even small fragments of Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Are corridors, fragment size and forest structure important for the conservation of leaf-litter lizards in a fragmented landscape?
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the implications of forest fragmentation for conservation of leaf-litter lizards the importance of fragment size, corridors and forest structure was examined in 20 forest fragments and six localities within a continuous forest in the Atlantic Plateau of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The fragments were 2-276 ha in area and had different degrees of connectivity depending on the presence or absence of corridors. Two species of lizards were dominant, Ecpleopus gaudichaudii and Enyalius perditus. Variation in forest structure among sites was important only in explaining the abundance of E. perditus. Regardless of variation in forest structure, lizard species composition, total lizard abundance, number of species and abundance of E. perditus were sensitive to fragmentation per se but not to fragment size or corridor linkage. The inhospitable matrix surrounding fragments is probably what determines the presence and abundance of E. perditus and the high er lizard richness in continuous forests. These conditions may have prevented lizard species from recolonizing the forest fragments. Our results emphasize that the conservation of this leaf-litter fauna depends on the maintenance of large tracts of continuous forests and not on the size of fragments or on the presence of forest connections. Strategies for conservation of leaf-litter lizards in such highly fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes should consider the enlargement of landscape connectivity between fragments and continuous forest, allowing the latter areas to act as a source of individuals for fragments.

TI  - Assessing strategies to enhance soil carbon sequestration with the DSSAT-CENTURY model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of no-till (NT) has been proposed to recover soil organic carbon (SOC), which will aid the mitigation of climate change. However, studies have questioned the potential of NT soils to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields. No-till experiments are relatively recent (<50 years) and very few studies were able to assess SOC dynamics in high-yield agroecosystems. We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to predict long-term SOC (0-30 cm) using datasets from two experiments assessing tillage and nitrogen (N) sources in a Mollisol from the midwest United States (28 years) and tillage and crop rotations in an Oxisol from southern Brazil (33 years). The conversion of prairie and grassland soils to conventional agriculture decreased SOC by 61 and 12% in the Mollisol and Oxisol, respectively. Soil organic C accrual in NT soils was >0.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) under medium-low-yield maize in the Mollisol and negligible in the Oxisol under soybean/wheat rotation. Organic fertilization and crop rotation increased SOC accrual at both sites. Simulated SOC had good agreement with observations for NT soils but overestimated SOC in tilled soils. The model's parameters were then modified for tilled soils. Long-term simulations (100 years) revealed that SOC accrual in NT soils (0-15 cm) is partially offset by losses at 15-30 cm under low C inputs. Simulations with best crop management practices (BP; irrigation, high-yield cultivars, higher plant density and improved N fertilization) augmented C inputs and SOC stocks, ultimately recovering SOC to the levels of prairie soils. Our results suggest that the adoption of NT, recycling of organic fertilizers and the use of BP should be further promoted for recovery and permanence of SOC in agricultural soils.HighlightsStudies have questioned the potential of conservation agriculture (CA) to deliver SOC sequestration and sustain crop yields.We used the DSSAT-CENTURY model to simulate SOC dynamics in temperate and subtropical soils.No-till under moderate C/N inputs recovered topsoil SOC, but subsurface losses offset SOC accrual.Use of CA, organic amendments and best practice crop management (BP) is crucial for long-term SOC storage and permanence.

TI  - Dynamic environmental zoning using the CA-Markov - Markov model and multicriteria analysis in a Brazilian Cerrado Watershed
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is considered a hotspot for biodiversity conservation. However, in recent decades, the intensification of human activities, directly influencing changes in use and coverage, has caused severe environmental problems. Thus, this study proposed a dynamic environmental zoning model for the P & acirc;ntano River watershed (PRW) based on the CA-Markov model and Multicriteria Analysis. The methodological procedures were based on predictive modeling of land use and land cover, analysis of environmental fragility, and estimation of soil losses and sediment delivery rate from the InVEST model for the years 1984, 2007, 2013, 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results showed that over the time analyzed and projected, in the category of Legal Restrictions Zone, there was a slight decrease in the extension of Permanent Preservation Areas, while the Natural Vegetation cover increased considerably, indicating possible changes in the environmental patterns of the region. The areas classified as Plains maintained minimal variations throughout the period studied. With regard to the Rural Productive Zone, there was a notable increase in areas with Low Restriction, suggesting an expansion of less restrictive agricultural and land use activities. On the other hand, the areas with Medium and High Restrictions showed decreasing trends, signaling possible improvements in environmental management and conservation of natural resources. Also noteworthy is the significant reduction in areas classified as High Restriction, associated with the high rate of soil loss. This trend is particularly relevant as it indicates practical efforts to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and promote sustainable soil management practices. Finally, the areas designated as Special Protection Zones, including Incongruities and Reservoirs, remained stable throughout the period analyzed, demonstrating the importance of preserving these areas to conservation of biodiversity and water resources. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study contribute to guiding public policies and environmental management practices in the PRW region. The observed trends indicate a positive evolution towards the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, underscoring the importance of continuous measures to ensure the health and resilience of local ecosystems.

TI  - Long-term, fire-induced changes in habitat structure and microclimate affect Cerrado lizard communities
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire transforms the structure of natural habitats and, consequently, modifies microclimates affecting ectotherm organisms that are particularly susceptible to changes in the thermal environment. Nevertheless, the effects of fire-induced microclimatic shifts upon natural populations have been neglected. We measured the central tendency and variation of habitat structural and microclimatic variables in experimental plots of Neotropical savanna vegetation subjected to different fire regimes and assessed their effects upon lizard community structure. In addition, we evaluated the underlying mechanisms linking fire-induced environmental changes to community structure, by comparing lizard body condition and survival between different fire regimes. Fire suppression promoted increased tree density, canopy cover and leaf-litter weight, whereas burning had the opposite effects, reducing the habitat structural complexity. The best predictors of fire regimes were means of structural variables, but variances of microclimatic variables, and the reduced structural complexity of burned plots both increased and decreased the variation of microclimatic variables. Lizard community structure was chiefly described by a gradient of decreasing tree density, canopy cover and leaf litter weight with increasing fire severity. About half of the lizard species were favored in the fire-protected plot, while the other half was favored in the burned plots, with most of the variation being explained by structural variables. Lizard body condition and survival rates were not affected by fire regimes, suggesting a dominant role of thermoregulation opportunities afforded by habitat structure-instead of food availability or predation rates-upon community structure. Our findings indicate that even sporadic fires can have profound effects upon lizard communities and that protecting some habitat patches from burning is essential to maximize lizard diversity in Cerrado landscapes.

TI  - Soil gaseous N2O and CH4 emissions and carbon pool due to integrated crop-livestock in a subtropical Ferralsol
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the impact of integrated crop-livestock (CL), with silage maize (Zea mays L.) in summer and grazed annual-ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in winter, and continuous crop (CC), with annualryegrass used only as cover-crop, on net greenhouse gas emission from soil (NetGHG-S) in a subtropical Ferralsol of a 3.5-year-old experiment in Brazil. Emissions from animal excreta in CL were estimated. Soil N2O fluxes after N application to maize were higher in CL (max. 181 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) than in CC (max. 132 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). The cumulative annual N2O emission from soil in CL surpassed that in CC by more than three-times (4.26 vs. 1.26 kg N2O-N ha(-1), p < 0.01), possibly because of supplementary N application to grazed ryegrass in CL (N was not applied in cover-crop ryegrass of CC) and a certain degree of soil compaction visually observed in the first few centimetres after grazing. The estimated annual N2O emission from excreta in CL was 2.35 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Cumulative annual CH4 emission was not affected significantly (1.65 in CL vs. 1.08 kg CH4-C ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.27). Soil organic carbon (OC) stocks were not affected by soil use systems, neither in 0-20-cm (67.88 in CL vs. 67.20 Mg ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.62) or 0-100-cm (234.74 in CL vs. 234.61 Mg ha(-1) in CC, p = 0.97). The NetGHG-S was 0.652 Mg CO2-C-eq ha(-1) year(-1) higher in CL than in CC. Crop-livestock emitted more N2O than CC and no soil OC sequestration occurred to offset that emission. Management of fertiliser- and excreta-N must be focused as a strategy to mitigate N2O fluxes in CL. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecology and conservation of grassland birds in southeastern South America: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The grasslands of southeastern South America (SESA), comprising one of the most extensive grassland ecosystems in the Neotropics, have been negatively impacted by the development of the livestock industry, arable agriculture, and forestry. SESA grasslands have a rich avifauna that includes 22 globally threatened and near-threatened species, and many other species have suffered local population extinctions and range reductions. In addition to habitat loss and fragmentation, grassland birds in SESA are threatened by improper use of agrochemicals, unfavorable fire management regimes, pollution, and illegal capture and hunting. Studies to date have provided information about the distribution of grassland birds, the threats populations face, and the habitat requirements of some threatened species, but more information is needed concerning dispersal and migration patterns, genetics, and factors that influence habitat use and species survival in both natural and agricultural landscapes. There are few public protected areas in the region (1% of original grasslands), and many populations of threatened grassland birds are found on private lands. Therefore, efforts to preserve grassland habitat must reconcile the interests of land owners and conservationists. Current conservation efforts include establishment of public and private reserves, promotion of agricultural activities that reconcile production with biodiversity conservation, development of multilateral conservation projects across countries, and elaboration of action plans. Measures that result in significant losses to private land owners should include economic compensation, and use of economic incentives to promote agriculture and forestry in native grassland areas should be discouraged, especially in priority areas for grassland birds. Although more studies are needed, some actions, particularly habitat protection and improved management of public and private lands, should be taken immediately to improve the conservation status of grassland birds in SESA.

TI  - Plant diversity, forest dependency, and alien plant invasions in tropical agricultural landscapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change and intensification in tropical rainforest regions is generally linked to a loss in species diversity that especially affects forest-dependent species. Indonesia is currently the country with the highest deforestation rates worldwide with potentially devastating effects on its diverse and highly endemic flora and fauna. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of the varied effects of forest conversion and land-use intensification on vascular plant diversity across the four dominant land-use systems in the lowlands of Sumatra: rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations. We conducted plot-based species inventories in Jambi Province and assessed a total of 156,006 individuals and 1382 plant species. Forest had the highest levels of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, followed by jungle rubber. Plant communities in oil palm plantations were characterized by a high density of herbaceous weeds, but low species numbers and low beta diversity. Species numbers were comparable in oil palm and rubber plantations, but the latter showed slightly higher beta diversity. Forest had a clearly distinct floristic composition while the floristic composition of the other systems and especially the two plantation systems - converged. Alien species were almost completely absent from forest, but the number and relative abundance of alien species increased with increasing land-use intensity and was highest in oil palm plantations where 25% of the species and 62% of the individuals belonged to alien species. Our results represent a first quantitative baseline for how forest conversion in Southeast Asia causes loss in species richness, changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, as well as a shift from native to alien dominated plant communities.

TI  - Soil carbon pools in different pasture systems
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the carbon pools of a tropical soil where the native forest was replaced with different pasture systems. We studied five pasture production systems, including four monoculture systems with forage grasses such as Andropogon, Brachiaria, Panicum, and Cynodon, and an agroforestry system as well as a native vegetation plot. Greater availability of fulvic acid was detected in the agroforestry system as compared with that in the other systems. Higher lability of C was detected in the Andropogon system during the dry and rainy seasons and during the dry season in Cynodon. During the dry season, all pastures systems showed deficits in the net removal of atmospheric CO2. The structure and practices of the agroforestry system enables more carbon to be sequestered in the soil as compared with the monoculture pasture, suggesting that it is an important practice to mitigate climatic change and to improve soil quality.

TI  - Interactions among leguminous trees, crops and weeds in a no-till alley cropping system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees improve the soil quality and their rapid growth in the tropics make agroforestry systems potentially effective for establishing low-input agricultural systems in this region. This study assessed the effects of the biophysical interactions among leguminous trees, weeds, cotton and maize in an alley cropping system. The experiment comprised six treatments: Clitoria + Gliricidia; Acacia + Gliricidia; Leucaena + Clitoria; Leucaena + Acacia; Leucaena + Gliricidia and Control and four replicates in randomised blocks. Cotton and maize were sown among the legumes. We analysed Ca, Mg, K, P and potential acidity and we measured the pH using CaCl2 in the soil. Weeds were collected from within a square 0.5 m on a side in the cotton area. The application of the residues affected only the levels of Ca and Mg of the soil. The residues did not produce any differences in the density and richness of the weed species. The sensitivity of some crops to the allelopathic effects induced by the tree residues is evident mainly in root growth, in nutrient uptake and in the growth of the shoot. The results presented here support the view that the criteria for the choice of tree species for agroforestry systems must go well beyond the potential to enhance soil fertility to obtain the best results from agroforestry systems.

TI  - Acidobacterial community responses to agricultural management of soybean in Amazon forest soils
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the impact of land-use changes and agricultural management of soybean in Amazon forest soils on the abundance and composition of the acidobacterial community. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) assays and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene were applied to study the acidobacterial community in bulk soil samples from soybean croplands and adjacent native forests, and mesocosm soil samples from soybean rhizosphere. Based on qPCR measurements, Acidobacteria accounted for 23% in forest soils, 18% in cropland soils, and 14% in soybean rhizosphere of the total bacterial signals. From the 16S rRNA gene sequences of Bacteria domain, the phylum Acidobacteria represented 28% of the sequences from forest soils, 16% from cropland soils, and 17% from soybean rhizosphere. Acidobacteria subgroups 18, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 22, and 25 were detected with subgroup 1 as dominant among them. Subgroups 4, 6, and 7 were significantly higher in cropland soils than in forest soils, which subgroups responded to decrease in soil aluminum. Subgroups 6 and 7 responded to high content of soil Ca, Mg, Mn, and B. These results showed a differential response of the Acidobacteria subgroups to abiotic soil factors, and open the possibilities to explore acidobacterial subgroups as early-warning bioindicators of agricultural soil management effects in the Amazon area.

TI  - Does deforestation promote or inhibit malaria transmission in the Amazon? A systematic literature review and critical appraisal of current evidence.
T2  - Royal Society Philosophical Transactions Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
M3  - Meeting paper
AB  - Considerable interest in the relationship between biodiversity and disease has recently captured the attention of the research community, with important public policy implications. In particular, malaria in the Amazon region is often cited as an example of how forest conservation can improve public health outcomes. However, despite a growing body of literature and an increased understanding of the relationship between malaria and land use/land cover change (LULC) in Amazonia, contradictions have emerged. While some studies report that deforestation increases malaria risk, others claim the opposite. Assessing malaria risk requires examination of dynamic processes among three main components: (i) the environment (i.e. LULC and landscape transformations), (ii) vector biology (e.g. mosquito species distributions, vector activity and life cycle, plasmodium infection rates), and (iii) human populations (e.g. forest-related activity, host susceptibility, movement patterns). In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on malaria risk and deforestation in the Amazon focusing on these three components. We explore key features that are likely to generate these contrasting results using the reviewed articles and our own data from Brazil and Peru, and conclude with suggestions for productive avenues in future research. This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

TI  - Factors Affecting the Abundance of Leaf-Litter Arthropods in Unburned and Thrice-Burned Seasonally-Dry Amazonian Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is frequently used as a land management tool for cattle ranching and annual crops in the Amazon. However, these maintenance fires often escape into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We examined the effect of experimental fires on leaf-litter arthropod abundance in a seasonally-dry forest in the Brazilian Amazon. The study plots (50 ha each) included a thrice-burned forest and an unburned control forest. Pitfall-trap samples were collected at 160 randomly selected points in both plots, with sampling stratified across four intra-annual replicates across the dry and wet seasons, corresponding to 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the most recent fire. Arthropods were identified to the level of order (separating Formicidae). In order to better understand the processes that determine arthropod abundance in thrice-burned forests, we measured canopy openness, understory density and litter depth. All arthropod taxa were significantly affected by fire and season. In addition, the interactions between burn treatment and season were highly significant for all taxa but Isoptera. The burned plot was characterized by a more open canopy, lower understory density and shallower litter depth. Hierarchical partitioning revealed that canopy openness was the most important factor explaining arthropod order abundances in the thrice-burned plot, whereas all three environmental variables were significant in the unburned control plot. These results reveal the marked impact of recurrent wildfires and seasonality on litter arthropods in this transitional forest, and demonstrate the overwhelming importance of canopy-openness in driving post-fire arthropod abundance.

TI  - Review of allometric equations for major land covers in SE Asia: Uncertainty and implications for above- and below-ground carbon estimates
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Our review of biomass studies conducted for 11 Southeast Asian countries, Papua New Guinea, and southern China uncovered 402 above-ground and 138 below-ground biomass allometric equations for the following major land covers: forest, peat swamp forest, mangrove forest, logged over forest, orchard and tree plantation, rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, bamboo, swidden fallow, and grassland/pasture/shrub land. No equations existed for non-swidden agroforest and permanent croplands, two other important land covers involved in current and projected land-cover transitions. We also found 245 stem-volume equations and 50 height-diameter equations. Applying existing allometric equations out of convenience is potentially a key source of uncertainty in above- and below-ground carbon stock estimates in many SE Asian landscapes. Differences in environmental conditions and vegetation characteristics should preclude the use of many pre-existing equations at locations outside of the geographical location where they were developed, without first verifying their applicability. While use of site-specific equations is preferred to reduce uncertainty in estimates, there are few in existence for many land covers and many geographical areas of the region. For example, few or no equations exist for Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Timor Leste. Ten or fewer above-ground biomass equations exist for rubber plantation, oil palm plantation, non-swidden agroforest, grassland/pasture/shrublands, and permanent croplands for the entire region. Even site-specific equations can introduce uncertainties to biomass estimates if they were determined from an insufficient sample size. Difficulties associated with sampling below-ground root biomass accurately often leads to allometric equations that potentially under-estimate below-ground biomass. In addition, substantial errors may be present if these below-ground equations are conveniently used by researchers in lieu of site-specific measurements. Although the importance of including wood density in allometry is increasingly recognized, only 26 of the reviewed studies did so. Ideally, when wood density values are used to estimate biomass, new on-site measurements should be taken, rather than relying on pre-existing values. This review demonstrates that more research in SE Asia is needed on biomass in general, specifically for several land covers including peat swamp forest, rubber and oil palm plantations, bamboo, swidden fallow, non-swidden agroforest, and permanent cropland. Importantly, for the purpose of informing the development and implementation of policies and programs such as REDD+, our meta-analysis highlights the pressing need to address the insufficient number of allometric equations and the possible inappropriate use of some when estimating vegetation biomass related to current and potential land cover changes in the region.

AB  - Community access to the land of Wan Abdul Rachman Grand Forest Park has started since a long time ago. Since 1998, the community has been permitted to use the land by emphasizing the sustainability aspect. Complex agroforestry systems have been established by combining several tree crops; most of them are food-producing plants. This research was aimed to study the composition and characteristics of the food-producing plant species, canopy strata, and its regeneration rate in the context of an agroforestry system. The research was conducted at two villages; those were Bogorejo and Cilimus, located in Pesawaran District, Lampung Province, from March to November 2018. Data collection was done through field observation and structured interviews with 59 farmers as respondents who managed the grand forest parkland. Data analysis was conducted using quantitative descriptive analysis method. The results showed that the complex agroforestry practices characterized by three canopy layers and one understorey. The mature food-producing plant species proportion was 86.85% of the total food-producing plants with plants density 735.97 individuals/ha. The density of tree crops population 847.42 individuals/ha with the highest density was found for coffee, cacao and candlenut. The existence of immature food-producing plants species was only 13.15%, indicating that the regeneration process had been initiated and conservation effort of the grand forest park still on-going.

T2  - CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL OF AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS: OPPOORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Agroforestry systems distinguish themselves from other forms of agriculture through their ability to store higher amounts of carbon (C) in their biomass, and often also to conserve more biodiversity. However, in both regards they are generally inferior to forests. Therefore, the impact of agroforestry practices on landscape C stocks and biodiversity needs to be analyzed both in terms of the interactions between agroforestry and forest, which may be positive or negative, and in terms of the conservation of C and biodiversity in the farming systems themselves. This paper argues that in forest frontier situations, the most important characteristic of land use systems in terms of C and biodiversity conservation is to be "land-sparing" (i.e. minimizing forest conversion), which requires a certain level of intensification. In land use mosaics, on the other hand, where natural habitat has already been reduced to small fragments, land use practices should also be biodiversity-friendly and have high levels of C storage to complement those in natural vegetation. Agroforestry has a role to play in both situations by making land use more sustainable and by making inhabited reserves ecologically and economically more viable. The paper presents three case studies where different sets of incentives are used to provide communities with the means to conserve C and biodiversity on their land and adjacent forest. In the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Mexico, C trading is combined with shade coffee (Coffea sp.) production to conserve and increase tree cover on farm land in biosphere reserves. In North Sumatra, Indonesia, coffee-growing communities receive technical and marketing support and assistance with legalizing their land tenure situation as incentives to stop forest conversion for coffee, with a prospect of adding C trading later. In the central Brazilian Amazon, communities reforest their land in an extractive reserve and offer reforestation credits on a local market while laying the basis for a more tree-based reserve economy. In all three cases, the bundling of various forms of incentives is meant to increase the resilience of the respective approach to market and policy changes. Approaches like these would benefit from a better integration of agricultural and forest policies.

TI  - Deep soil carbon storage in tree-dominated land use systems in tropical lowlands of Kalimantan
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although carbon (C) stored deep in soils of tree-dominated land use systems in the tropics represents a large reservoir of organic matter its vulnerability to land use change has been hardly assessed. To fill this gap, we sampled Acrisols down to 3 m under three different land use systems; namely, recent cacao agroforestry (<2 years old; not deeper than 1 m), young and old rubber gardens (<10 years and >50 years), and secondary forest (>50 years) all located in Kapuas Hulu regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We then assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as well as C accumulated in above- and belowground biomass, litter and dead wood debris at the soil surface. The amount of C stored in soils to a depth of 1 m exceeded the amount stored in living biomass (Sigma C stored in roots, understorey and overstorey) strongly in the cacao agroforestry systems (69 Mg SOC vs. 12 Mg biomass-C ha(-1)), slightly in young rubber gardens (85 Mg SOC vs. 69 Mg C ha(-1)), but not in old rubber gardens (87 Mg SOC vs. 200 Mg C ha(-1)) and secondary forests (65 Mg SOC vs. 138 Mg C ha(-1)). Additionally in the older systems, up to 140 Mg C ha(-1) (old rubber gardens) and 116 Mg C ha(-1) (secondary forest) were found in soils to a depth of 3 m, thus raising soil C stocks by 60 to 80% relative to C stored in upper soil (0 to 1 m). We conclude that (1) the form of land use and land use change can substantially affect C stocks in living biomass, with aboveground biomass in old rubber gardens comparable to that of secondary forests; and (2) that land use change can reduce SOC in topsoil, but that substantial C stocks found in deep (down to 3 m) subsoil remain stable.

TI  - Impacts of selective logging on avian phylogenetic and functional diversity in the Amazon
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is the most extensive land use threatening tropical forests worldwide, making our understanding of its impacts on biodiversity vital for the conservation of these hyperdiverse ecosystems. We investigated the effects of selective logging on the phylogenetic and functional diversity (FD) of Amazonian forest avifauna. We sampled the overall and the understorey bird community using point counts and mist-netting, respectively, in logged and unlogged forests. The overall bird community showed significantly lower phylogenetic diversity (PD) and FD in logged than unlogged forests, but significantly higher standard effect size (ses) of PD, ses mean pairwise distance (MPD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), ses functional MPD (sesfMPD) and functional MNTD (fMNTD) in logged sites. Evolutionary distinctiveness, sesMPD, sesFD, fMNTD and sesfMNTD of understorey birds were significantly higher in logged forests. Higher logging intensity affected some metrics negatively and others positively, although the relatively small changes in phylogenetic and FD suggest limited overall effects from logging at lower intensity. In combination, selective logging brings deleterious effects for some components of phylogenetic and FD of the overall Amazonian bird community. Nonetheless, selectively logged forests retain important avian diversity, underscoring their high conservation value. Relatively, low impacts of selective logging may be due to the reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques used, high connectivity with well-preserved unlogged forests or focus on short-term logging impacts. Because even low-intensity RIL causes some losses in evolutionary history and functional traits, an optimal approach for conserving phylogenetic and FD requires incorporating some land-sparing logging to protect more old-growth patches within the logged matrix.

TI  - Ant Community in Neotropical Agrosystems: A Four-Year Study in Conventional and No-Tillage Systems
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies comparing agricultural practices that maintain a better quality and a healthy soil fauna consider the no-tillage farming as the most effective practice when compared to other planting techniques. In order to evaluate the influence of the no-tillage and conventional tillage methods (with and without manipulation of the soil before planting, respectively) on ant communities, we monitored two areas with these two types of practice (conventional and no-tillage) over the period of four years. We collected ants once per month along 10 transects randomly distributed using three pitfall traps in each area. In addition, we collected the dead plant biomass present at each point sampled as a parameter for measuring the environmental complexity of the areas. In total, we captured 27,480 individuals belonging to 26 species in the no-tillage area and 24,570 individuals belonging to 24 species in the conventional tillage area. The generalised linear model analysis showed that the no-tillage system had the highest abundance of individuals, as well as richness and diversity of species, during most of the study period, as compared to conventional tillage areas. We also found a significant positive correlation between species richness and dead plant biomass. Thus, it is possible to infer that the no-tillage area is a more complex environment with a greater diversity of ants and, therefore, a more sustainable agrosystem as compared to conventional tillage areas.

TI  - Conservation agriculture cropping systems in temperate and tropical conditions, performances and impacts. A review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, in a context of climate change, economical uncertainties and social pressure to mitigate agriculture externalities, farmers have to adopt new cropping systems to achieve a sustainable and cost-effective grain production. Conservation agriculture consists of a range of cropping systems based on a combination of three main principles: (1) soil tillage reduction, (2) soil protection by organic residues and (3) diversification in crop rotation. Conservation agriculture has been promoted as a way to reduce production costs, soil erosion and soil fertility degradation under both tropical and temperate conditions. Conservation agriculture-based cropping systems have diffused widely under Brazilian large-scale farms' conditions and more recently in Europe in the context of medium-size mechanized farms. Their diffusion, however, is still limited under small-scale non-mechanized farms' conditions of tropical countries. To assess the advantages and limits of such new cropping systems, this article compares experiences with conservation agriculture from the tropical Cerrado region of Brazil and from temperate conditions of Europe. It focusses on agronomic performances, environmental impacts and economical results. Conservation agriculture systems appear to be interesting options to achieve sustainable and intensive crop production under different agroecological environments because they use efficiently available resources and maintain soil fertility. However, this mostly results from the permanent presence of an organic mulch on the soil surface and the incorporation of cover crops in the rotations. Such modifications require a significant reorganization of the production process at farm level, and when facing technical or socioeconomic constraints, most farmers usually opt for applying only partially the three main principles of conservation agriculture. Investigating more fully the consequences of such partial implementation of conservation agriculture principles on its actual efficiency and assessing the most efficient participatory approaches needed to adapt conservation agriculture principles to local conditions and farming systems are top priorities for future research.

TI  - On-farm evaluation of the establishment of clonal rubber in multistrata agroforests in Jambi, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Symposium on Multistrata Agroforestry Systems with Perennial Crops
CL  - TURRIALBA, COSTA RICA
AB  - Perennial tree crops are often grown in complex multistrata systems that incorporate natural vegetation. These systems contribute simultaneously to sustaining rural livelihoods and to the conservation of biodiversity, but their productivity is usually low. Introduction of high yielding germplasm, usually selected in monocultural plantations, is a potential way to increase productivity, but a critical requirement is that such plants can be established in a competitive multispecies environment. The establishment of clonal planting stock in the jungle rubber agroforests of Indonesia was explored through participatory on-farm research. The trial involved four farmers who grew clonal rubber trees in a total of 20 plots, constituting five replicate experimental blocks spread across four farms. Unexpectedly, vertebrate pest damage by monkeys (Presbytis melalophos nobilis) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) was the most important influence on establishment, explaining almost 70% of the variation in rubber tree growth. The amount of labour invested in weeding was also positively correlated with rubber tree growth. Farmers generally decided to completely cut back vegetation between rows of rubber trees, including potentially valuable trees, rather than weeding within the rows and selectively pruning trees in the inter-row. Farmers thought that the inter-row vegetation would harbour vertebrate pests and compete with the clonal rubber, and they had access to fruits, firewood and other non-timber forest products from other land. Thus, contrary to expectations, when offered clonal germplasm, farmers opted to use plantation monoculture methods to protect what they considered a valuable asset, rather than maintain the traditional multispecies strategy they use with local germplasm.

TI  - Mineral-organic associations are enriched in both microbial metabolites and plant residues in a subtropical soil profile under no-tillage and legume cover cropping
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Knowledge of the impacts of no-tillage and cover cropping on carbon accumulation and stabilisation in highly weathered agricultural soils of subtropical regions is scant. We hypothesised that implementation of no-tillage coupled with high-quality legume residues in highly weathered agricultural soils would result in high carbon accumulation rates, mainly as microbe- and plant-derived materials in fine mineral-organic complexes. Aims and methods We sampled soil profiles down to 100 cm in a long-term field experiment and used density and particle size fractionation in combination with carbohydrate analyses to compare the effect of conventional tillage vs no-tillage, combined or not with legume cover cropping, and combined or not with mineral nitrogen fertilisation. Key results Both no-tillage and legume cover crops favoured the accumulation and enrichment in plant-derived carbohydrates in the surface soil layer, due to the accumulation of plant residues. The ratio of microbe- to plant-derived carbohydrates increased with soil depth indicating that the soil carbon (C) was more microbially processed than at the surface. Conservation management systems also increased soil C at depth and this was most visible in the clay fraction. The additional clay-size C accumulating at depth under conservation treatments was of both microbial and plant origin. Conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that mineral-associated C is composed of both plant and microbial residues and is positively influenced by conservation management practices. Implications Our results demonstrate that no-till and legume cover cropping are efficient practises to foster C accumulation and stabilisation in heavily weathered agricultural soil profiles in a subtropical climate.

TI  - Forest cover, extinction thresholds and time lags in woody plants (Myrtaceae) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: resources for conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to conserve tropical forests could be strengthened based on ecological knowledge, such as extinction thresholds in ecological processes. Many studies of extinction thresholds associated with habitat reduction have focused on animals, generally at the patch scale. However, certain plant groups are very interesting models with which to study this type of relationship, such as Myrtaceae in Neotropical forests. Because trees are long-lived organisms, local extinctions in response to habitat loss may occur in different ways due to a time lag. In this study, our objective was to assess the occurrence of extinction thresholds at the landscape scale for Myrtaceae in a large biome and the pattern of species reduction in different tree size classes. We studied nine landscapes with different amounts of available habitat (between 5 and 55 % forest cover) in different parts of the Atlantic Forest in Bahia, Brazil, and in each landscape, we evaluated four plant classes based on tree circumference: saplings (CBH between 8 and 15 cm), young (CBH between 15 and 30 cm) adults (CBH a parts per thousand yen30 cm) and total (all individuals with CBH a parts per thousand yen8 cm). Landscapes with forest cover less than 25 % presented an approximately sixfold reduction in Myrtaceae total species richness compared with landscapes with forest cover greater than 40 %. We identified a relationship with a threshold between the amount of available habitat at the landscape level and Myrtaceae richness, with a reduction in total, sapling and young species below a threshold of 40 % forest cover, whereas adults had an extinction threshold at 30 % forest cover. We discuss the differences among the categories of plants associated with a time lag and the possibilities and limitations in applying these results in environmental management.

TI  - From forest to pastures and silvopastoral systems: Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks changes in northeast Amazonia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado-Amazon ecotone has been under intense pressure over the years from agricultural and urban expansion, both of which are land uses that directly affect soil quality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the responses of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, soil organic matter (SOM) quality, carbon isotopic composition (13C) from C3 and C4 plants and carbon sequestration and emission to silvopastoral systems, natural vegetation (NV), fallow pasture (FP), and intensive management pasture (IMP). Silvopastoral systems had different shading levels: 25 % (SP25), 50 % (SP50) and 75 % (SP75). The grass cultivated in all treatments was Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaca. The experimental design consisted of four replicates, and collection sites were distributed in strips throughout the study areas at different soil layers (0.00-0.05; 0.05-0.15; 0.15-0.30; 0.30-0.60 and 0.60-1.0 m deep). The conversion of natural vegetation in FP areas and silvopastoral systems (SP25 and SP75) led to increases in total C and N stocks (up to 1.0 m) when compared to other land use systems (SP50, IMP, and NV), which did not occur with total labile-C and C-POM. FP, SP25 and SP75 significantly increased labile C stocks in MAOM found in the 0.30-0.60 m layer. A greater enrichment of 13C in MAOM was observed with increasing depth for silvopastoral systems (SP25, SP50 and SP75) and NV. C-MAOM stocks derived from C3 plants were higher in soils under SP25 and SP75 and from C4 plants under FP. C-POM stocks were higher in all silvopastoral systems under study. IMP and FP affected 613C values in MAOM and POM, especially in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. C sequestration increased under FP and SP25, with greater contributions from C4 and C3 plants, respectively. Of the silvopastoral systems, SP25 had the highest C stock in soil and contributed to the sequestration of 1.67 Mg C ha-1 yr- 1.

AB  - Rachmawati A, Yustian I, Pujiastuti Y, Suparman Shk, Arinafril. 2023. Biotic and dragonfly diversity indices as ecological quality evaluation in Lahat District Rivers, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 24: 6059-6068. The Lematang, Sandaran, and Kungkilan rivers have been reported to be polluted by coal mining activities. This study aimed to evaluate the ecological conditions using a dragonfly as a bio-indicator. Dragonfly surveys were conducted using direct observation procedures in 11 research sites determined by purposive sampling based on positions of the upstream, midstream and downstream of the river entering the coal mining area, including settling ponds managing waste from post-mining activities (stockpiles and disposal). Dragonflies were captured by visual observations, direct capture, and sticky traps. Data were analyzed by calculating the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI) and Diversity Index. The correlation between dragonflies and environmental factors was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) according to Jaccard's index. The results showed there were 23 species of dragonflies. Larvae and exuviae were found in Aeshnidae and Libellulidae families. Dragonfly species with the highest DBI values were seen in Rhyothemis triangularis, Tholymis tillarga, Zyxomma petiolatum, Atrocalopteryx atrata, Libellago lineata and Rhinocypha fenestrata. Sandaran River had the highest DBI value and diversity index because of the undisturbed condition of the area, which had natural vegetation and unpolluted water conditions. The Kungkilan River will become the focus of river rehabilitation, starting with the reclamation of the river riparian area.

TI  - Floral abundance and corolla length predict the importance of species in connecting urban green areas
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing urbanization rate and its consequences on biodiversity and species interactions worldwide, the connection among urban green areas, performed by interacting species, is still poorly understood. We evaluated how plant and hummingbird species vary across the urban landscape of a tropical city in Brazil, identifying traits of species taking part in shared interactions between areas. We recorded plant-hummingbird interactions in five green spaces and two remnants of native vegetation, and: (1) contrasted species traits and species-level indices of both plants and hummingbirds; (2) evaluated how species and interactions vary among pairs of areas; (3) used a meta -network approach to identify which pairs of interacting species are more important in connecting areas. Species turnover was the component that better explained the beta-diversity of interactions among sites. In green spaces, plant species presented greater centrality and longer corollas than in remnants. However, both plants and hummingbirds were similarly specialized regardless of the type of area. Trees with large floral displays and with longer corollas shared more interactions and were present in more networks. Most interactions recorded in remnants are unique to them, due to the exclusiveness of some hummingbirds and plant species in such native habitat and are, thus, more sensitive to habitat conversion. Our findings support the importance of preserving remnants and using mass flowering native species in urban afforestation to maintain plant-hummingbird interactions and promote urban biodiversity. We evidenced that few interactions (16.6%) were redundant across areas, indicating a highly susceptible and fragmented system in the urban space.

TI  - ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI: COMPOSITION, LENGHT EXTRARADICAL MYCELIUM AND GLOMALIN IN AREAS OF ATLANTIC FOREST, RIO DE JANEIRO
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is considered an environment of great biodiversity. However, by constantly being subjected to intense human pressure, is very fragmented and disconnected, surrounded by extensive matrices formed by pastures, capoeiras, monocultures and urban areas. Fragmentation, as well as certain uses and soil management can cause changes in the composition and activity of soil microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Fragmentation, as well as certain uses and soil management may entail a reduction of edaphic microflora. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the composition of the population of mycorrhizal fungi (MF) in different areas, to determine the influence of vegetation on the abundance of AMF spores in the length of extraradical mycelium (LEM) and levels of Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) the ground. The systems were evaluated: annual crops (Anag); perennial agriculture (PAG), pasture, secondary forest early stage (SFES), secondary forest medium stage (SFME); advanced stage secondary forest (ASSF). Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-5 cm, in two different seasons (summer and winter), and analyzed the abundance of spores and species composition of AMF, the LEM, and the presence of GRSP. It was recovered a total of 27 morphotypes of spores of AMF, and AMF species was that which was present in all areas studied in both seasons and in most cases with a high frequency of occurrence. The abundance of AMF spores was influenced by the type of vegetation. A low AMF sporulation was observed in the area of Anag both stations. The agricultural areas have changed the species composition of AMF in relation to forest systems. The concentration of GRSP - easily extractable (GRSP-EE) fell in the SFME for agriculture.

AB  - As a mitigation target for Indonesia's Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink 2030, Gunung Halimun Salak National Park (GHSNP) has a high potential. However, there is a lack of data on tree species composition and vegetation cover, particularly in the traditional zone (TZ). This study aims to estimate the vegetation cover of GHSNP in 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as tree species composition in the TZ compared to the wilderness zone ( WZ). This study used Sentinel-2 imagery and plot establishment for vegetation analysis in both zones. The most dominant class of vegetation cover in GHSNP from 2016 to 2022 is in class 5 which has highly dense vegetation. The large area class 5 increased by around 2.17% from 2016 to 2022. There were 17 species found in TZ and 24 species in WZ. Local communities are applying the traditional agroforestry of Poh-pohan (Pilea trinervia) as the main commodity and Pinus merkusii for the shade trees. P. merkusii and Maesopsis eminii are the most frequently found in TZ and WZ due to the former status of GHSNP as a production forest. Agroforestry systems can enhance biodiversity as a conservation effort and Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 actions.

TI  - Pyrodiversity begets taxonomic and functional richness of tropical mammals
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how species respond to the environmental heterogeneity created by fire (i.e., pyrodiversity) is essential to protect biodiversity in the face of current changes in the natural fire regime. Pyrodiversity is hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but this hypothesis has mixed support and has never been tested for medium- and large-sized mammals in a neotropical savanna. Here, we investigated how mammalian communities respond to fire frequency, fire age, and spatiotemporal variations in these fire regime elements (pyrodiversity) at multiple spatial scales (from 0.8 to 78.5 ha). We sampled medium- and large-sized mammals using camera traps distributed on 30 sites in grassland and typical savanna formations. We applied multiple regression analysis to describe the relationships between fire regime variables and mammal communities. Mammals responded to the fire regime only when the spatiotemporal variation was considered. Taxonomic and functional mammal richness increased with variations in fire age, but mammal diversity and functional dispersion were greater at intermediate pyrodiversity. Moreover, mammal abundance responded positively to diversity of fire frequency but negatively to fire age diversity. Our results indicate that pyrodiversity can lead to taxonomically and functionally rich communities, probably due to more forage, shelter, and movement opportunities for different species in heterogeneous environments. Nonetheless, its effect on abundance seems limited. We recommend focusing fire management in savanna landscapes on the diversity of fire age mosaics, at least for medium and large mammals. Moreover, management conducted on intermediate scales (similar to 80 ha) is sufficient to generate pyrodiversity that affects mammal communities.

TI  - Long-term cover crops and no-tillage in Entisol increase enzyme activity and carbon stock and enable the system fertilization in southern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of cover crops and the adoption of no-tillage are essential conservation practices to increase carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and increase soil microbial activity. However, in lowland areas cultivated with irrigated rice, there is a large gap on the effects of no-tillage with long-term cover crops on soil attributes, crop responses and the effect of the system fertilization. The aim of this work was to evaluate the long-term adoption of cover crops and no-tillage on soil microbial activity, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and on the response of irrigated rice to system fertilization. Treatments consisted of fallow-conventional, fallow-no tillage, annual ryegrass, Oat, Ornithphus micranthus and Lotus cornicultaus. In the sub-plots, system and conventional fertilization per crop were compared. The experiment was conducted in southern Brazil in an Entisol and started in the 1996/97 crop season. Cover crops associated with the use of no-tillage increases basal respiration (+ 31%) of the soil, & beta;-glucosidase activity (+ 259%), SOC and N stocks. Urease activity increased by an average of 41% in no-tillage under cover crops compared to the conventional system under fallow, with the exception of ryegrass. System fertilization promoted higher dry matter production (+ 130%) in grasses and a lower increase (+ 23%) in winter legumes. The use of long-term no-tillage and cover crops promoted higher rice productivity (+ 9%). In this way, the association of cover crops and no-tillage increases C and N stocks and the biological activity of the soil under long-term continuous irrigated rice cultivation.

TI  - Impact of pasture, agriculture and crop-livestock systems on soil C stocks in Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use can result in either sources or sinks of atmospheric carbon (C), depending on management practices. In Brazil, significant changes in land use result from the conversion of native vegetation to pasture and agriculture, conversion of pasture to agriculture and, more recently, the conversion of pasture and agriculture to integrated crop-livestock systems (ICL). The ICL system proposes a diversity of activities that include the strategic incorporation of pastures to agriculture so as to benefit both. In agricultural areas, for example, the implementation of ICL requires the production of quality forage for animals between crops as well as the production of straw to facilitate the sustainability of the no-tillage (NT) management system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the modifications in soil C stocks resulting from the main processes involved in the changes of land use in Amazonia and Cerrado biomes. For comparison purposes, areas under native vegetation, pastures, crop succession and ID. under different edapho-climatic conditions in Amazonia and Cerrado biomes were evaluated. This study demonstrated that the conversion of native vegetation to pasture can cause the soil to function either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO2, depending on the land management applied. Non-degraded pasture under fertile soil showed a mean accumulation rate of 0.46 g ha(-1) year(-1). Carbon losses from pastures implemented in naturally low fertile soil ranged from 0.15 to 1.53 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, for non-degraded and degraded pasture. The conversion of native vegetation to agriculture in areas under the ICL system, even when cultivated under NT, resulted in C losses of 1.31 in six years and of 0.69 Mg ha(-1) in 21 years. The conversion of a non-degraded pasture to cropland (soybean/sorghum) released, in average, 1.44 Mg of C ha(-1)year(-1)to the atmosphere.The ICL system in agricultural areas has shown evidences that it always functions as a sink of C with accumulation rates ranging from 0.82 to 2.58 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The ICL produces soil C accumulation and, as a consequence, reduces atmospheric CO2 in areas formerly cultivated under crop succession. However, the magnitude of C accumulation in soil depends on factors such as the types of crops, the edapho-climatic conditions and the amount of time the area is under ICE (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Review
AB  - Soil fauna play a crucial role in agricultural development, directly influencing soil health and crop productivity. This study utilized scientometric analysis to investigate current knowledge about soil fauna across different agricultural agroecosystems. A total of 1,127 documents were identified in the Web of Science Core Collection using the search terms, covering research from 1967 to 2024. The findings showed a steady increase in publications, peaking in 2022. Brazil, France, and China were the most productive countries, with France showing significant influence, marked by a centrality of 0.25. The analysis of knowledge areas and keywords indicated a growing interdisciplinarity in the study of soil fauna, reflecting a rising interest in understanding ecological relationships comprehensively. The main organisms evaluated include meso and macrofauna, earthworms, mites, springtails and nematodes, with variations in management practices focusing on the functions that soil fauna performs within the agroecosystem. Although research has traditionally focused on conventional agricultural systems, attention is shifting toward agroecological and organic systems. Emerging trends include studies on toxicology and food chains, emphasizing topics such as microplastics and interactions with microorganisms. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive and current overview of soil fauna research in agricultural environments, highlights the increasing importance of soil fauna in the development of sustainable agricultural systems, and anticipates continued interest in this area, particularly in relation to broader ecological relationships, suggesting future research directions.

TI  - Impact of management regime and frequency on the survival and productivity of four native tree species used for fuelwood and charcoal in the caatinga of northeast Brazil
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonally dry deciduous forest (Caatinga) of northeast Brazil is under intense human pressure, and sustainable use of its tree resources for fuelwood is a pressing concern. An experiment was conducted to ascertain which management techniques (coppicing, pollarding or crown-thinning) permit the highest survival of trees and optimal timber production. Four much-utilised tree species: Croton sonderianus, Mimosa ophthalmocentra, Mimosa tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis (syn. Caesalpinia pyramidalis) were studied at two sites in Pernambuco State. The impact of each harvesting regime was evaluated over a six-year period, with additional variables including wet-season versus dry-season harvesting, and three-year versus six-year harvesting cycles. The best performing tree species varied between sites, with M. tenuiflora providing the highest yields with all treatments at Sertania and M. tenuiflora and Poincianella pyramidalis at Serra Talhada. The optimal management regime did not vary between species. Crown-thinned trees produced limited regrowth with the lowest mortality rates, and when ultimately coppiced growth appeared to have been stimulated. Pollarding was intermediate and coppicing was the poorest management strategy. Trees which were harvested twice, in both 2005 and 2008, had much lower overall production than those which had only been harvested once in 2008. The highest yields were obtained from crown-thinned trees which were coppiced in 2005 or 2008. Management decisions must consider local environmental conditions in the selection of the tree species used to produce fuelwood, however, the optimal management strategy for high production and low mortality is consistently low impact, infrequent crown thinning. There was considerable difference in the findings between the study sites (e.g. in the distribution of statistically significant results), and also in the impacts of treatments on mortality between the four species. The results can be used to guide species-level management regimes that minimise tree mortality, contributing to long-term fuelwood productivity.

CL  - DARWIN, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Loss of environmental services provided by forests is a non-linear process in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Intermediate-intensity land-use types in the form of complex agroforests have maintained global environmental benefits under a sustainable and profitable land use regime. Conversion to tree crop monocultures, however, poses a challenge to the environmental stakeholders and an opportunity from to stakeholders in the private economy. We quantified environmental indicators, as well as profitability and sustainability of a range of existing and possible production systems. Criteria and indicators were used at plot to landscape scales, taking into account local, national and global perspectives. Agronomic sustainability and profitability were assessed at plot level as they are of primarily local concern, while environmental services of forests, such as plant species and functional type richness, carbon stocks, greenhouse gas emissions, and trans-boundary haze, which are of national and global concern, were assessed at landscape level. Quantitative trade-offs and complementarities were analysed between global environmental benefits and local profitability. The current trend towards simplification of the complex agro-ecosystems and inherent loss of environmental services of forests is driven by profitability. The sequence in which environmental services of forests are lost is: standing carbon stocks, biodiversity, an low or negative greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Coleoptera Diversity and Soil Properties in Land Use Systems
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the abundance and diversity of Coleoptera in five land use systems (LUS) and the soil properties that explain the distribution of these organisms. Uses involved native forest (NF), Eucalyptus plantation (EP), perennial pasture (PA), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and no-tillage (NT) in western Santa Catarina, Brazil. Coleopterans were sampled by the methods of pitfall traps and soil monoliths during the winter and summer. Regardless of the LUS, 1,441 individuals were captured, with Staphylinidae being the most representative family (similar to 47%). The use of NF showed higher abundances of coleopterans. The land use systems PA, NT, and ICL obtained high values of diversity of Coleoptera families, depending on the method and season of collection. The distribution of families was influenced by the sampling season, and some soil properties such as biopores, water content and phosphorus can explain the variation of abundance among the LUS.

TI  - Allometric relationships of frequently used shade tree species in cacao agroforestry systems in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shade trees play an important role within agroforestry systems by influencing radiation and wind regimes as well as nutrient and hydrological cycling. However, there is a lack of quantitative assessments of their functions. One of the reasons is the rare information on structural characteristics of shade tree species. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide basic information on the structure of frequently used shade tree species for the implementation of models simulating the ecosystem processes in agroforestry systems. The investigation of the shade trees was conducted at two cacao agroforestry sites on Sulawesi, Indonesia. The measurements of the main structural parameters: diameter at breast height, tree height, trunk height, crown length and crown radius were carried out for the shade tree species Aleurites moluccana, Cocos nucifera and Gliricidia sepium. For data collection, the National Forest Inventory Field Manual Template by FAO (2004) was applied. Based on this information allometric functions were derived for the correspondent shade tree species. The best significant relationships were obtained for the height-crown length relationship of the dicotyledonous tree species' A. moluccana and G. sepium with a coefficient of determination rA(2)A = 0.925 and rA(2)A = 0.738, respectively, and the height-crown length relationship of the monocotyledonous palm C. nucifera with rA(2)A = 0.663. The transferability tests 'analysis of covariance' and 'homogeneity of slopes' have shown that the obtained allometric functions are also applicable to other cacao agroforestry systems of the region.

TI  - Is there a relationship between enchytraeids diversity and community with soybean (Glycine max L.) productivity in no-till system in subtropical soils of Brazil?
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the productivity of crops of agricultural interest and their interactions with physicochemical soil properties is widely explored. However, there is still a gap concerning the contribution of biological soil attributes and especially the relationship between crop productivity and the structures of organism communities within the soil, such as the enchytraeids. This paper aimed to evaluate the diversity and structures of enchytraeids communities in subtropical soils and their relationship with soybean productivity and soil properties within a no-tillage system. This study was conducted in soybean growing grounds working under no-till farming systems in southern Brazil. Samples were collected according to ISO 23611-3 and extracted with the hot-wet methodology. The organisms were identified up to their genus level. Enchytraeids density increased with the increase of soybean productivity for both evaluated crops. Enchytraeus, Fridericia, and Hemienchytraeus were more abundant in high productivity and genus Achaeta was only found in the second crop and was not a sensitive indicator toward changes in soybean productivity. Regarding the relationship between the enchytraeid community and soil attributes, the variables clay, phosphorus, moisture contents, pH, Ca/Mg as well as carbon and nitrogen from soil and litter, affected Enchytraeidae distribution. Enchytreids showed significant correlations with soybean productivity in the no-tillage system for subtropical soils in Brazil, demonstrating potential bioindicators of soil quality and consequently of soybean productivity.

TI  - The livelihood impacts of oil palm: smallholders in Indonesia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity and climate consequences of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) expansion across South East Asia have received considerable attention. The human side of the issue, highlighted with reports of negative livelihood outcomes and rights abuses by oil palm companies, has also led to controversy. Oil palm related conflicts have been widely documented in Indonesia yet uptake by farmers has also been extensive. An assessment of the livelihood impacts of oil palm development, including sources of conflict, is needed to shed light on the apparent contradiction between these reports and the evident enthusiasm of farmers to join the oil palm craze thereby informing future expansion. We assessed the impact of oil palm development on the economic wellbeing of rural farmers in Indonesia. We found that many smallholders have benefited substantially from the higher returns to land and labour afforded by oil palm but district authorities and smallholder cooperatives play key roles in the realisation of benefits. Conflicts between communities and companies have resulted almost entirely from lack of transparency, the absence of free, prior, and informed consent and unequal benefit sharing, and have been exacerbated by the absence of clear land rights. We make specific recommendations to improve the present situation and foster the establishment of smallholder friendly production regimes. Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is set to continue. If environmental standards can be raised and policy interventions targeted at the broader social impacts of land development this expansion may be achieved to the significant benefit of large numbers of rural smallholders.

TI  - Soil physical quality response to sugarcane straw removal in Brazil: A multi-approach assessment
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residues have an essential role in sustaining soil functions and the removal of sugarcane straw for bioenergy production can exacerbate the adverse impacts of mechanized harvesting on soil quality. A long-term field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of straw removal on soil physical quality in southern Brazil. We performed a multi-approach assessment including quantitative physical indicators (bulk density-BD; soil resistance to penetration-SRP; macroporosity-MaP; microporosity-MiP; mean weight diameter of aggregates-MWD), biological indicator (earthworm abundance), apparent electric conductivity (ECa) and visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS). In addition, VESS scores were correlated with quantitative indicators for testing its potential as a feasible integrative soil quality indicator. Straw removal rates (total removal, TR-0 Mg ha(-1); high removal, HR-5 Mg ha(-1); low removal, LR-10 Mg ha(-1); no removal, NR-15 Mg ha(-1)) were arranged in a randomized block design with four repetitions. Except for MaP, straw removal for four years affected all soil physical attributes, with higher soil degradation observed in TR and HR plots. Soil moisture, earthworm abundance and ECa values were reduced by higher rates of straw removal. The VESS method was able to detect the changes in soil structural quality, and VESS scores averaged 4.5 and 3.9 for the TR and HR plots respectively, thus revealing signals of severe structural degradation. The data also showed that VESS scores correlated with quantitative indicators broadly used for soil assessments, which suggest VESS as a reliable and integrative indicator for monitoring soil structural quality in sugarcane fields. Our findings support that LR, keeping about 10 Mg ha(-1) of straw on the soil surface, can be a management target to ensure the sustainability of bioenergy production.

AB  - The land management in the buffer zone of the protected area has been considered important to support biodiversity in the conservational area. Many areas in the buffer zone of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (BTSNP) in Malang Regency, Indonesia, have been threatened by improper agricultural activity. The objective of this study was to examine the profiles of soil quality and biodiversity of several sloping agricultural land management in the buffer zone. The assessment of soil quality (pH and C Organic) and biodiversity of trees, shrubs, and herbs were done in the five land use type i.e. bare land, monoculture of chili, pine-coffee, pine-taro, and coffee agroforestry. The data were analyzed using the principal component analysis. The results showed that agroforestry with coffee as the main crop was the most appropriate land management model for biodiversity, carbon storage, sustainable agroforestry, and production profit stability.

TI  - CLUSTERING LOCAL PLANTS IN THE RIPARIAN ZONE OF THE KAMPAR RIVER, INDONESIA: TOWARDS AN AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role of biodiversity management strategies aimed at developing sustainable agricultural and food systems. Riparian vegetation management strategies are essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems, particularly through the selecting suitable plant species. The objective of this study is to analyze the riparian vegetation of the Kampar River basin and clustering species. The study was conducted in the riparian area of the Kampar River, Indonesia, across eight stations. The methods included phytosociological relev & eacute;s, cluster analysis, and ecophysiological indicator analysis. The study identified 38 dominant plant species in the riparian area of the Kampar River Basin on podsolic soils, grouped into five main clusters. On peatlands, 26 plant species were identified, organized into three clusters based on similarities in chemical and physical properties of soil and mesoclimatic factors. The identification and use of local plants that are well-adapted can be used to develop riparian vegetation management strategies and support sustainable agriculture in the riparian zone of the Kampar River Basin.

TI  - Effect of land use change on ecosystem function of dung beetles: experimental evidence from Wallacea Region in Sulawesi, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - The deforestation of tropical forests and their subsequent conversion to humandominated land-use systems is one of the most significant causes of biodiversity loss. However clear understanding of the links between ecological functions and biodiversity is needed to evaluate and predict the true environmental consequences of human activities. This study provided experimental evidence comparing ecosystem function of dung beetles across a land use gradient ranging from natural tropical forest and agroforestry systems to open cultivated areas in Central Sulawesi. Therefore, standardized dung pats were exposed at each land-use type to assess dung removal and parasite suppression activity by dung beetles. The results showed that ecosystem function of dung beetles especially dung burial activity were remarkably disrupted by land use changes from natural forest to open agricultural area. Dung beetles presence enhanced about 53% of the total dung removed and reduced about 83% and 63% of fly population and species number respectively, indicating a pronounce contribution of dung beetles in our ecosystem.

TI  - The end of gunpoint conservation: forest disturbance after the Colombian peace agreement
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2016, after 52 years of armed conflict, the Colombian government and the primary rebel group, the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) reached a peace agreement. The agreement incorporated three changes to institutions governing forest land occupation and use: (a) the demobilization of FARC from forested places, (2) the future distribution of legal land titles and new road construction into forests, and (3) the eradication of illicit crops. However, we document unprecedented rates of forest disturbance in the months following the peace agreement in biodiversity hotspots across the country. Are the declaration of peace and the increased rates of forest disturbance related? Here, we present the first systematic assessment of the impact of the Colombian peace agreement on forest disturbance. Focusing on the Andes-Amazon Transition Belt (AATB), we used automated satellite image disturbance detection methods and ethnographic data to quantify and interpret forest cover change from 2010 to 2018 that span wartime, peace negotiation, and post-peace agreement stages. Our findings indicate that during the post-peace agreement period (2017-2018), the area of forest disturbance increased by 50% (about 238 000 ha) across the AATB in comparison with the four-year peace negotiation stage (2013-2016); these changes reflect the end of FARC-led gunpoint conservation in the region. Forest disturbance also spread deeper into the Amazon watershed and increased in area by 187% within the AATB's protected areas. We find that following the peace agreement and the withdrawal of FARC, key actors (viz. drug cartels, large landowners, campesinos and dissidents) with expectations of favorable land tenure policies swept into the region; this led to increases in large-scale cattle ranching, coca cultivation dispersal, and speculative illegal land markets each of which contributed to the widespread forest disturbance that we mapped. The rapid increase in forest disturbance occurred despite the interest of the international community in promoting forest conservation initiatives in the AATB and Colombia's existing conservation and land titling frameworks for public lands. Our findings underscore the need for conservation strategies sensitive to rapid institutional and demographic changes in the course of the peace agreement to prevent forests from becoming an unexpected casualty of premature and unstable peace.

TI  - Carbon Accumulation and Partitioning Above and Belowground under Coppiced and Replanted Eucalypt Plantations
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent to which the C sink strength of eucalypt plantations can be affected by coppicing or replanting remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated variations in C stocks under coppiced or replanted eucalypt stands formed by clones or seedlings. For each field assessment (0 [T0], 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 7.0 years [at harvest]), tree biomass, litterfall, and soil C stocks (0-120 cm depth) were determined. At harvest, debarked stemwood productivity was similar under coppice or replanting, about 50.0 Mg C ha(-1). Generally, coppiced stands favored subsoil C storage (40-100 cm), whereas replanted stands favored soil C accrual in topsoil (0-20 cm), depending on the genetic material. Relative to T0, soil C increased about 2.14, 1.91, and 1.84 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under coppice, replanting with seedlings and clones, respectively. Coarse root biomass under these stands were about 17.3, 13.4, and 9.5 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, equivalent to 50% of total harvest residues. Hence, inputs from coarse roots could represent a large contribution to soil C over multiple rotations under coppiced or replanted stands. Otherwise, short-term C losses can be high where stumps and coarse roots are harvested, especially following successive coppice cycles. Study Implications: Our findings have important implications for forest managers growing eucalypt plantations aiming to maximize C accumulation. Both coppiced and replanted stands can fix up to 50 Mg C ha(-1) only in debarked stemwood over 7 years, with a comparatively higher C storage in coarse roots under coppice. Despite the increasing demand for forest residues in bioenergy production, harvesting stumps and coarse roots should be avoided, especially upon replanting eucalypt stands after successive coppice cycles.

TI  - Conversion of forest to cinnamon plantation depletes soil carbon stocks in the top metre of the tropical highlands of Kerinci Regency, Jambi Province, Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of conversion from natural forest to cinnamon plantation on the top 1 m soil carbon stocks and soil characteristics. The project was conducted on Andosols of Kerinci Regency, Sumatera, Indonesia, sampling the soil profile under natural forests and a chronosequence of cinnamon plantations of different ages (1, 5 and 10 years). SOC stocks were quantified alongside physical properties (bulk density) and chemical properties (carbon, nitrogen, C/N ratio) to investigate the impact of land conversion. SOC stocks increased 1 year after conversion to cinnamon plantations, but then tended to decrease as the plantations got older. The initial increase was observed alongside decreasing bulk density 1 year after forest conversion to cinnamon plantation, likely as a result of the fresh input of (less dense) pyrogenic soil organic matter as a result of slash and burn practices and transport down the soil profile owing to leaching. In older plantations SOC stocks were lower, probably because organic matter had been decomposed or leached out of the profile. The free particulate organic matter (fPOM) was isolated from selected topsoil and subsoil layers and analysed for carbon, nitrogen, and FTIR analysis. FTIR analysis revealed that topsoil fPOM contained more aromatic functional groups than subsoils and had a higher degree of decomposition. Aromatic and carbohydrate functional groups were initially lower in recently converted cinnamon plantation, but the trend was reversed 10 years after conversion. The initial flush of fresh organic matter into soils after slash and burn provides fPOM with a lower degree of decomposition but is short-lived and fPOM becomes more microbially processed as the cinnamon plantation ages. We conclude that, after a short term increase brought about by slash and burn, forest conversion to cinnamon plantation in Kerinci Regency depletes SOC stocks both in topsoils and subsoils.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to identify flower development and fruit formation as well as identification of flower-visiting insects as potential pollinators. Observations carried out in three sample trees, and five flowering branches at each sample tree were marked. We also carried out the identification of flower-visiting insects, foraging behavior, visiting rate, number of visiting insects, and time of flower visit. The results showed that in one year, 2-3 reproductive cycles might occur, which one cycle lasted about 1-2 months. In a panicle of flowers, flower buds, flower bursts and fruitlets are found simultaneously. The panicle has 5-34 flower buds. The development of buds to panicle formation takes 5-7 days, while the time required for flower and fruit development from generative buds up to yellow fruit was in a range between 38 to 67 days or 1 to 2 months. The total reproductive success of sample trees was varying from 12% to 17%. The most dominant flowers-visiting insects and alleged as pollinators of G. arborea is a carpenter bee (Xylocopa latipes) that actively visiting flowers at 8:00 until 11:00 am. Insect visited about 5 to 20 flower panicles with an average of 11 flower panicles per minute.

TI  - Species Richness and Abundance of Social Wasps (Vespidae: Polistinae) Associated with Shaded Cocoa Agroforests ( Theobroma cacao L.) in Southern Bahia State, Brazil.
T2  - Sociobiology
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional cocoa agroforests of southern Bahia in Brazil, locally known as "cabrucas", are highly relevant for sheltering forest species, being thus recognized as a biodiversity-friendly agricultural system. However, despite their role in biodiversity conservation, little is known about the ability of cocoa agroforests to maintain social wasp assemblages in human-modified landscapes. Here, we present the first list of social wasp species recorded in shaded cocoa agroforests in southern Bahia. In total, we collected 25 species of social wasps belonging to nine genera, representing 20% of the known species richness for the entire northeastern region of Brazil. In particular, Angiopolybia pallens (Lepeletier), Agelaia angulata (Fabricius), and Agelaia centralis (Cameron) were the most abundant species, with 186, 70, and 36 individuals, respectively. Notably, we report six previously unrecorded species from Bahia state: Agelaia flavipennis (Ducke), Polybia emaciata Lucas, Polybia quadricincta (Saussure), Agelaia angulicollis (Spinola), Parachartegus smithii (Saussure) and Protopolybia acutiscutis (Cameron). Of these six species, three are recorded for the first time in the Northeast region of Brazil and two for the Atlantic Forest biome. Based on our findings, we emphasize that cocoa agroforests can contribute to maintaining the diversity of social wasps in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Impact of plot size on tropical forest structure and diversity estimation
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Inventories are essential for forest management, but, in the Amazon region, the absence of standardization produces information loss, low accuracy, and inconsistent measurements. This prevents valid comparisons and compromises the use of information in networks and software. Sampling unit size is of key importance in the inventory of native forests, particularly regarding accuracy and costs.Objective: To identify a plot size that provides adequate precision for dendrometric parameters in the Amazon.Methods: In Cotriguacu, Mato Grosso, Brazil, we tested four plot sizes with six repetitions each: 2 500, 5 000, 7 500, and 10 000 m(2). We measured diameter at breast height, population density, basal area, and biomass. We applied Shannon and Jaccard indexes; Weibull 2P and Gamma functions to fit the diametric distribution; and the Akaike Information Criterion for the best model.Results: There was a directly proportional relationship between plot area and population similarity, but diversity did not indicate significant alterations. Plot size did not affect dendrometric attributes and diametric distribution. Larger plot areas led to lower coefficients of variation and smaller confidence intervals. The Gamma function was the best model to represent the distributions of different plot sizes.Conclusions: For similar forests, we recommend the 2 500 m(2) plot to evaluate diameter at breast height, population density, basal area, and biomass.

TI  - Structure and conservation value of high-diversity hedgerows in southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the tree component of hedgerows resulting from the natural colonization of land plot boundaries' ditches. These three-meter wide ditches were dug during the European occupation of southeastern Brazil, and are a prominent feature of the landscape. The hedgerows are connected to forest fragments within a farmland matrix. In two systems of hedgerows, we sampled a total of 2.28 ha (114 plots of 200 mA(2)), where we evaluated the structural and floristic similarity between fragments and hedgerows, the similarities between the hedgerows and the fragments' edges and interior, and the relationships between distribution of tree species and soil variables. The systems presented similar richness and diversity; hedgerows had greater similarity to the fragments included in the same system than to hedgerows of the other system, indicating possible functional linkages between their components (fragments and hedgerows). Tree species composition in the hedgerows was not more similar to the fragment edges as we expected. The hedgerows exhibited greater density and basal area than the fragments. For either single system, species showed preferences for fragments or hedgerows or for sections of the ditch (edge, wall and bottom of the ditch), but for species common in both systems, those preferences were rarely held. The environmental conditions in the ditches seem to favor the establishment of species from the fragments, even those more common in fragment interior, suggesting that, in spite of their narrow widths, these hedgerows may play an important role in the conservation of flora without negatively impacting agriculturally productive rural areas.

TI  - Dung beetles in a tight-spot, but not so much: Quick recovery of dung beetles assemblages after low-impact selective logging in Central Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are suffering several changes due to human activities. Among these, selective logging may represent a less damaging alternative, although it may alter species compositions of animals and plants in forest ecosystems. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are used as bioindicators as they respond quickly to environmental changes. Thus, in this study, we tested the effects of time after logging and seasonality on species richness, number of individuals, and assemblage structure of dung beetles in central Brazilian Amazon Forest. We also identified indicator species of logged and unlogged sites. We used a total of 240 flight interception traps (20 per area) in 11 logged sites (between one and 15 years after logging) and one unlogged site. We collected 28,508 dung beetles from 85 species. Most individuals (24,349, 85.41%) were collected during the dry period. Four species were good indicators of the unlogged site, while 21 species were indicators of logged sites. Time after logging and seasonality significantly affected species richness, the number of individuals collected, and assemblage structure. These effects were more significant from the second to the fifth year after logging. Logged sites represented 77% to 95% of species richness in the unlogged site. From the sixth year after logging, dung beetle assemblages were significantly recovered. Our results show that low-impact selective logging practices in sustainable forest sites may not cause irreversible impacts on dung beetle diversity.

AB  - Palm oil mill in Indonesia disposed of 4 million tons of fibers' waste from oil palm fruits mesocarp in 2016. The waste has excellent potential as a growing medium for seedlings. The study aimed to analyze its fertilizer effect on bambang lanang seedling growth. The study was conducted from May to August 2018, at the nursery of Agriculture Faculty, Bengkulu University. A complete randomized design was applied with seven treatments and six replications. The treatments were controlled, NPK (2 g; P1), NPK and Osmocote (R) (1 and 1,5 g; P2), NPK and (1.5 and 2 g; P3), Osmocote (R) (1.5 g; P4), Osmocote (R) (2 g, P5), and Osmocote (R) (3 g, P6). The fibers' waste from oil palm fruits mesocarp was chosen as the media. The addition of fertilizer yielded significantly different results in height, diameter, leaf number, and dry weight of seedlings. The treatments of P1, P2, and P3 gave better result on height (30.14 - 33.95 cm), diameter (5.65 - 5.97 mm), leaf numbers (11.04 - 11.17 leaf), leaf width (64.22 - 65.86 cm(2)), and dry weight (1.60 - 2.27 g seedling(-1)) than other treatments (P4, P5, and P6). The seedling sturdiness ratio for those treatments was 5.36 - 5.70 and could be classified as good seedlings. The P2 treatment could be applied as fertilizer to improve seedlings growth in nursery.

TI  - The regime complex for tropical rainforest transformation: Analysing the relevance of multiple global and regional land use regimes in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, international agreements, treaties, and conventions address tropical deforestation and specific causes of rainforest transformation. Such international regimes may aim to conserve natural forests or to support the exploitation of lands for a particular purpose, e.g. agricultural commodities. This paper's goal is to map the international regime complex for rainforest transformation by identifying those global and regional regimes that are relevant for tropical rainforest transformation systems in Indonesia. The relevance of international regimes for rainforest transformation is assessed based on a novel methodology using two criteria: First, international' regimes may be relevant in Indonesia because the core problem they address exists in Indonesia (problem dimension). Second, specific international regimes may be made relevant by the actions of specific actors and their coalitions in pursuit of their interests (actor dimension). To achieve the study's goals we used (I) content analysis of international policy documents and treaty texts, (2) expert interviews with key informants in Indonesia, and (3) own field observations in current Indonesian land use politics. The results indicate that regimes dealing with biological diversity, climate change, trade in endangered species, wetland management, international tropical trade, illegal logging, Southeast Asian (ASEAN) forest and environment, the Asia Pacific free trade, and the southeast Asian rubber trade regime are relevant in both the problem and actor dimensions. The regimes concerned with desertification and international forestry research are relevant only in the actor dimension. In contrast, the following regimes are relevant only in the problem dimension: indigenous rights, forest certification, palm oil certification, agroforestry certification, and international rubber trade. We discuss our results considering global and regional regimes relevant to Indonesian rainforest transformation systems. We conclude that regimes relevant solely due to the engagement of domestic actors and not in respect of the problem dimension are unlikely to maintain their relevance in the long term. In the short term, however, they have the potential for creating substantial political benefits for the actors using them. In contrast, regimes with high problem relevance but low actor backing are unlikely to even enter the political agenda, and therefore will have only limited impact. This suggests that future research should consider that, whilst relevance in the problem dimension is necessary to establish regime influence, it alone does not suffice. We can expect global and regional regimes to have an influence only when powerful actors back them in their agenda setting, domestic policy formulation and actual implementation.

TI  - Kebon tatangkalan: a disappearing agroforest in the Upper Citarum Watershed, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive study was carried out on a typical indigenous agroforestry system, called kebon tatangkalan, in the changing agricultural landscape of the Upper Citarum Watershed, West Java, Indonesia. ne main objectives of the study are to elucidate the structural patterns, multidimensional functions, and dynamics of this multi-layered agroforest. The study has identified 12 groups of different plant assemblages indicating that this type of agroforest contributes considerably to the heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape in the study area. Multivariate analysis suggests that elevation and slope are the biophysical factors that correlate most significantly with the distribution of plant species in kebon tatangkalan. The presence of this man-made vegetation is currently declining from the landscape due to population growth and rapid regional economic development. Serious effort to revitalize this traditional agroforest is needed to prevent its disappearance. Introduction of highly productive species and establishment of integrated policies in regional land-use planning and management are measures that should be taken into account in preserving this traditional agroforestry system.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes in brazilian climate-smart agricultural and livestock systems: A systematic and critical overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical climate-smart agriculture could be a cost-effective and scalable nature-based solution toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the coming decades. Nevertheless, the lack of integrated on-farm CO2, CH4, and N2O flux measurements remains a barrier to including these systems in certification programs and the carbon (C) market. This systematic literature review critically examines field-measured GHG emission studies within climate-smart agri-systems in Brazil, aiming to: (i) integrate GHG-measured data, (ii) explore geographical representativeness and connections between organizations and authors, (iii) analyze distributions of studied GHG molecules, climate-smart system types, and productive components, (iv) conduct a meta-analysis on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture, and (v) identify methodological and scope gaps, providing insights for future research directions. The systems considered include no-till, well-managed pasture, integrated croplivestock, and integration with trees (i.e., crop-forestry, livestock-forestry, crop-livestock-forestry, and multistrata agroforestry). Out of 1200 papers mentioning GHGs and climate-smart systems, 74 contained reliable onfarm flux measurements. Most authors were Brazilians affiliated with Embrapa and public Universities. Studies concentrated on the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, with scarce data for other biomes. Over half of the trials assessed individual GHG molecules and only one climate-smart system. Urochloa spp. and Avena spp. were the most studied forage genera, while soybeans and corn dominated annual crops. Eucalyptus spp. and beef cattle were common trees and animals. No-till, integrated crop-livestock, and agricultural integrations involving trees showed soil C-CH4 influx from 0.8 to 1.0 kg ha-1 y-1. Transitioning from pasture monoculture to integrated systems decreased N-N2O emissions by up to 1.63 kg ha-1 y-1. Converting extensive grazed land to intensifiedintegrated systems reduced animal CH4 intensity, with cuts of up to 122 g CH4 per kg of average daily weight gain. Future research must urgently address methodological issues, such as de-standardization (e.g., 8-10 flux units found per GHG molecule) and the absence of crucial ancillary variables. In conclusion, adopting diversified climate-smart agri-systems shows potential to mitigate GHG emissions, but caution is advised when extrapolating our numerical findings due to limited data across Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions. We urge scientists to prioritize frequent on-farm measurements of all three GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) along with agroecosystem C sequestration across multiple climate-smart systems, enabling reliable and comparable net GHG flux calculations to identify the most sustainable option. Advancing and standardizing GHG measurements in Brazil offer an opportunity to enhance GHGs inventory accuracy, calibrate models, and promote policies and investments that expand refined tropical climate-smart agriculture.

TI  - Analysis of information used in the management of plant genetic resources: a case study from northwestern Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation and monitoring are critical to agroforestry (AFS) project management, especially if they aim to contribute to use and conservation of biodiversity and plant genetic resources. A methodology to analyze information used in decision-making processes was developed and applied in a biodiversity conservation project in the Brazilian Amazon. Quality of information gathered at landscape, AFS, species (Bactris gasipaes Kunth, both wild and cultivated varieties) and genetic diversity levels in three dimensions was analyzed. The information at the landscape level was good, while that in the organizational-institutional and socio-economic dimensions was acceptable; information gaps were serious in the genetic-ecological dimension. Ecological and economic functionality assessment based on indicators built upon reported administrative actions suggests that information related to conservation played a greater role in decision-making and management than information associated with use and development. The application of the methodology proved instrumental for enhancing efficacy of decision-making within an adaptive management approach to plant genetic resources use and conservation.

TI  - Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from a subtropical Ultisol by using long-term no-tillage in combination with legume cover crops
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be partially mitigated with conservation agriculture. In this study, we assessed the effects of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), as well as five NT cover crop-based cropping systems, on yield-scaled GHG emissions in two long-term experiments (18 and 19 years) on a subtropical Paleudult. Air samples collected in static closed chambers were used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes. The annual rate of change in soil organic C from the beginning of the experiments was used as proxy for net CO2 flux. Cumulative annual emissions of the three GHG and the CO2 costs of agricultural inputs and operations were taken in full account when estimating the global warming potential (GWP). Under legume cover crops, NT soil exhibited increased N2O emissions relative to CT soil (531 vs 217 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)); however, emissions of this gas from NT soil were fully offset by CO2 retention in soil organic matter (-2063 to -3940 kg CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Soil CH4 fluxes were very low with all management systems (-1.5 to 30.5 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)). NT soil under legume cover crops behaved as a net sink for GHG (GWP ranged from -971 to -2818 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)); by contrast, CT soil and NT soil with a low biomass input were net sources of GHG (GWP ranged from 857 to 2133 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)). The legume cover crops increased maize yield and further reduced yield-scaled GHG emissions. This result suggests that conservation management practices involving no-till in combination with legume cover crops provide an effective approach to sustainable low-C footprint food production in subtropical regions.

AB  - It has been a fact that the Freeport Indonesia Company has been playing a positive role in the industry through its involvement in the gold and copper mine sector. However, the actions also result in serious environmental destructions and pollution to the local society.Besides focusing on the environmental problems, human rights, and the conflicts arise among the local community, this thesis also analyses the important factors that contribute to the positive development of Papua.Through the export of mineral resources, royalty and tax, Freeport contributes plenty in the economy of the country and the province.Freeport improves the adverse effects, focusing on the development and the welfare of the local community, Environmental friendly management, understanding of the local traditional practices by the local community. Through these, Freeport continues to develop and practice a diverse ways of policies for the people living within the mining area and its society. On the other hand Freeport is running the Controlled Riverine Tailings Management program (or SIRSAT), reclamation and re-vegetation program, environmental management program, waste and energy management program, biodiversity conservation program, local people employment, local education support program, hospital construction and medical support, health and safety program, human rights education, programs for local economic independence etc. It shows that Freeport is concentrating on the living of the local society through its way of management.However, there are still problems to be solved. The mining area has been decreased according to the contract and the loyalty has been increased. The current president Joko Widodo is addressing this issue with the raise of the percentage of shareholding and the extend of the contract on the smelting factory. As such, not only the issue of shareholding and the smelting factory is addressed, however, the extention of the contract, local environment problem and land compensation are involved as well with the land compensation issue being the most sensitive matter. It is anticipated that if the problem of land compensation and the extention of contract are solved prior to any other issue and obtain the cooperation from the local community, Freeport can be a valuable contributor to the development of Papua.

TI  - Implementing and Monitoring the Use of Artificial Canopy Bridges by Mammals and Birds in an Indonesian Agroforestry Environment
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical forest habitats. Some of the fastest diminishing tropical forest habitats in the world occur in Indonesia, where fragmentation is severely impacting biodiversity, including on the island of Java, which holds many endemic species. Extreme fragmentation on the western part of the island, especially due to small-scale agriculture, impacts animal movement and increases mortality risk for mainly arboreal taxa. To mitigate this risk in an agroforest environment in Garut District, West Java, we installed 10 canopy bridges and monitored them through camera trapping between 2017 and 2019. Five of the monitored bridges were made of waterlines and five of rubber hose. We recorded Javan palm civets using the waterline bridges 938 times, while Javan slow lorises used the waterlines 1079 times and the rubber bridges 358 times. At least 19 other species used the bridges for crossing or perching. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple and cost-effective materials can be used to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. We also recommend the use of camera traps to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions.

TI  - Too rare for non-timber resource harvest? Meso-scale composition and distribution of arborescent palms in an Amazonian sustainable-use forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Arborescent palms can provide an important source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within tropical forest REDD+ frameworks. To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined mesoscale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 x 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km(2) grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live above-ground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha(-1) (range: 0-28.1 Mg ha(-1)). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities.

TI  - Impact of crop management systems on soil nematode communities in South Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of nematode communities allows inferring consequences of management practices on the soil food web. We studied the taxonomic structure of nematode communities in preserved areas of the Atlantic forest (native forest = NF) in Ponta Grossa, Parana State, Brazil, and in three different agroecosystems in neighboring areas to assess the effect of agricultural land use on nematode assemblages. Agroecosystems were located in a red latosol cropped during 30 years under conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), and minimal tillage (MT). We collected ten composite soil samples in each area in the summer. Nematodes were extracted by Baermann funnel and fixed with formalin. Subsequently, individuals were classified into taxonomic groups and counted on a Peters slide to determine densities of each taxon. Plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes were classified at the genus level. Data were analyzed with the parameters abundance, Bray & Curtis, Shannon-Weaver, and Simpson indexes. We recorded 35 genera and abundance of nematodes in MT and NT areas was more similar. Higher richness was observed in NF in relation to cropped areas, especially under NT and CT. The PCA and clustering analyses from both nematode communities and soil chemical characteristics showed that MT and CT were more similar and NT was clustered near NF. The replacement of native vegetation by cropping systems caused a reduction of nematode diversity, demonstrating the influence of agricultural practices on nematode communities.

TI  - Diversity, utilization, and sustainable management of wild edible fruit plants in agroforestry systems: a case study in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the diversity, utilization, and sustainable management of wild edible fruit species (WEFs) in agroforestry systems in the Saripoi and Olong Ulu villages of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This study aims to analyze the species richness of WEFs, evaluate their contributions to local livelihoods, and identify challenges to sustainable management. Field surveys were conducted in 40 agroforestry home gardens, representing 40 households actively engaged in these systems. Data were gathered through direct observation and interviews with 228 respondents, all of whom manage their agroforestry areas. A total of 61 WEFs from 16 plant families were discovered, with Phyllanthaceae and Moraceae being the most prominent. High-value species such as Durio kutejensis and Artocarpus integer significantly contributed to household income. However, despite these advantages, land tenure insecurity, limited market access, pest management issues, and the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) pose major threats to the long-term sustainability of agroforestry systems. The decline of TEK is largely attributed to urban migration among younger generations, disrupting the intergenerational transmission of traditional knowledge. Sustainable harvesting strategies, such as selective hand-picking, were found to be effective in preserving productivity, whereas more aggressive methods were linked to lower yields and tree damage. Policy interventions should focus on securing land rights for uncertified land and social forestry areas by accelerating land certification, simplifying permit processes, and strengthening legal recognition of agroforestry to ensure long-term security for smallholder farmers and indigenous communities. In addition, policymakers should prioritize rural infrastructure development, enhance market access, and support the integration of TEK with contemporary agroforestry practices. These strategies are essential for strengthening the ecological and economic sustainability of agroforestry systems while safeguarding rural livelihoods amid socioeconomic transformations.

T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrus pyrifolia is a common temperate fruit crop cultivated in Southern Brazil for fruit production. Although this plant species is found in several Brazilian states (Parana, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul), it is predominantly concentrated in the smallholder farming system in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Our aim was to compare the soil biota community composition, soil chemical properties, and soil quality in two adjacent stands with different ages. Within each stand, we analysed the influence of four organic residue management practices. Our results indicated that both studied stands, influenced by different organic residue management practices, exhibited differences in soil biota community composition, soil chemical properties, and soil quality. Acaridae, Araneidae, Blattidae, Halictophagidae, and Opiliones were the main contributors, explaining 78.08% of the variance in the data. The 16-year-old stand, with compost utilization, displayed a high biodiversity of soil organisms, average soil chemical properties, and the highest values of soil quality, creating a habitat for predators and providing energy for litter transformers and ecosystem engineers in subtropical Acrisol. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the influence of old stands on soil biota community composition, soil chemical properties, ecosystem homeostasis, herbivory pressure, and prey-predation relationships. This, in turn, may enhance interest in establishing new management plans for Pyrus pyrifolia stands in commercial orchards.

TI  - Greenhouse gas balance and carbon footprint of beef cattle in three contrasting pasture-management systems in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated Systems (IS) have been identified as an efficient land-management strategy for restoring degraded areas worldwide, increasing crops and beef yields and providing technical potential for carbon (C) sequestration in soil and trees as an option for offsetting CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle production. The aim of our study is to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and the C footprint of beef cattle (fattening cycle) in three contrasting production scenarios on the Brachiaria pasture in Brazil-1) degraded pasture (DP), 2) managed pasture (MP), and 3) the crop-livestock-forest integrated system (CLFIS) presenting new alternatives of land use as a GHG mitigation strategy. Area-scaled total GHG emissions were highest in MP (84,541 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)), followed by CLFIS (64,519 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)) and DP (8004 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)) over a 10-yr period. Our results note that the highest C footprint of beef cattle was in the DP, 18.5 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW (live weight), followed by 12.6 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the CLFIS and 9.4 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the MP, without taking into account the technical potential for C sequestration in MP (soil C) and CLFIS (soil and Eucalyptus C). Considering the potential for soil C sequestration in the MP and CLFIS, the C footprint of beef cattle could be reduced to 7.6 and -28.1 kg CO(2)eq per kg LW in the MP and CLFIS, respectively. The conversion of the degraded pasture to a well-managed pasture and the introduction of CLFIS can reduce their associated GHG emissions in terms of kg CO(2)eq emitted per kg of cattle LW produced, increasing the production of meat, grains and timber. This reduction is primarily due to pasture improvement and increases in cattle yields and the provision of technical potential for C sinks in soil and biomass to offset cattle-related emissions.

TI  - Biodiversity Impacts of Increased Ethanol Production in Brazil
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing domestic and international ethanol demand is expected to result in increased sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Sugarcane expansion currently results in land-use changes mainly in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, two severely threatened biodiversity hotspots. This study quantifies potential biodiversity impacts of increased ethanol demand in Brazil in a spatially explicit manner. We project changes in potential total, threatened, endemic, and range-restricted mammals' species richness up to 2030. Decreased potential species richness due to increased ethanol demand in 2030 was projected for about 19,000 km(2) in the Cerrado, 17,000 km(2) in the Atlantic Forest, and 7000 km(2) in the Pantanal. In the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, the biodiversity impacts of sugarcane expansion were mainly due to direct land-use change; in the Pantanal, they were largely due to indirect land-use change. The biodiversity impact of increased ethanol demand was projected to be smaller than the impact of other drivers of land-use change. This study provides a first indication of biodiversity impacts related to increased ethanol production in Brazil, which is useful for policy makers and ethanol producers aiming to mitigate impacts. Future research should assess the impact of potential mitigation options, such as nature protection, agroforestry, or agricultural intensification.

TI  - Exposure To Climate Risk: A Case Study For Coffee Farming In The Region Of Alta Mogiana, Sao Paulo
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies around the world show an increase in global average temperatures, with a consequent increase in extreme events and changes in the distribution of precipitation, causing a decrease in agricultural production and changes in planting areas. This study analyzed the exposure to climate risk that the coffee crop in the region of Alta Mogiana/SP, Brazil has been presenting in the past thirty years (1991-2021). Time series of daily data of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were used. By the statistical tests we observed a trend of increase in maximum temperatures daily of approximately 1.4 degrees C and minimum daily of 0.8 degrees C in the municipalities of the region and a trend towards a decrease in precipitation of 0.9 mm daily, indicating greater exposure of the coffee crop in the region to climate risk and increased vulnerability for the coffee producer. In view of these analyses, a literature review was carried out, suggesting agroforestry systems and mechanical irrigation as the most promising strategies to manage climate risk in coffee plantations. In addition, drought-resistant cultivars, training courses for farmers, increased rural insurance, and nutritional control of the plants can also be considered efficient options for climate exposure in coffee plantations from Alta Mogiana.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY AND CARBON STORAGE OF UNDERGROWTH AND LITTER IN THE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM OF NORTH SUMATERA-INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to look into the diversity of species and carbon storage in agroforestry systems in the Forest for Special Purpose at Aek Nauli, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. A total of 60 subplots, 1.0x1.0m were used to represent different undergrowth species in the agroforestry system. By identifying constituent species in the agroforestry system, the diversity of undergrowth species was studied, and the potential for biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter was measured and analyzed. Undergrowth species in agroforestry Toona sureni and Coffee Arabica are significantly richer in plant species (27 species vs. 14 in agroforestry P. Merkusii and C. Arabica). The results showed that the diversity undergrowth was categorized as moderate, and the evenness indices were low, ranging from 0.33 to 44. In the agroforestry system, the mean biomass of undergrowth was 1.65 tons ha(-1), and the carbon storage of undergrowth was 0.43 tons ha(-1). Meanwhile, litter biomass was 5.18 tons ha(-1) on average, with 2.5 tons ha(-1) of litter carbon storage. Both biomass and carbon storage of undergrowth and litter in agroforestry T. Sureni, and C. Arabiba vs. P. Merkusii and C. Arabica are significantly different. By applying sustainable agroforestry management in forests for special purposes, this study helps with future climate change adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal trends of forest cover change in Southeast Asia
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The current state of tropical forest cover and its change have been identified as key variables in modelling and measuring the consequences of human action on ecosystems. The conversion of tropical forest cover to any other land cover (deforestation) directly contributes to the two main environmental threats of the recent past: 1) the alteration of the global climate by the emission of carbon to the atmosphere and 2) the decline in tropical biodiversity by land use intensification and habitat conversion. The sub-continent of Southeast Asia exhibits one of the highest rates of forest loss and comprises one of the regions with the highest amount and diversity of flora and fauna species, worldwide.The knowledge of the spatial and temporal trends in the variation of forest cover in tropical regions is a prerequisite for the development and establishment of mitigation strategies from the global to the regional level. However, there is considerable disagreement in recent estimates of tropical forest cover change ranging from continuing and intensified decline in forest loss to a distinct decrease in deforestation rates and up to stagnation in other cases. Against this background, the present study aims at a review and comparison of recently available global forest cover estimates for the region of Southeast Asia. In a case study, the results at the national level will be compared to an analysis at the regional level for the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The outcome of the study provides recommendations for future remote sensing based forest assessments in tropical regions.

TI  - Natural regeneration of trees in selectively logged forest in western Amazonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the impacts of selective logging on tree regeneration one, four, and eight years after harvests in Antimary State Forest in the State of Acre, Brazil. We inventoried tree seedlings, saplings, and poles (>50 cm tall to <10 cm DBH) on secondary roads, log landing, and skid trails, as well as in the bole and crown zones of canopy gaps created by felling; for comparison we also sampled areas not affected directly by logging. We compared these habitats on the basis soil (physical) characteristics, canopy cover, and floristic composition. For areas one and four years after logging, we supplemented the ground-based information with aerial LiDAR data. By eight years post-logging the size class distributions of tree regeneration in all habitat types resembled those in unlogged areas, and densities were only lower in crown gaps. Eight years after logging, relative densities of pioneer trees were highest on secondary roads and log landings; no among habitat differences were observed in the relative densities of non-pioneer species at any time along the chronosequence. Tree species diversity (Fisher's alpha) converged on unlogged values on skid trails, bole gaps, and crown gaps at 8-years post-logging, but values remained lower on secondary roads and log landings. Canopy openness was greatest one year after logging, especially in log landings (mean 45.4 +/- SE 4.5%) whereas four and eight years post-logging it did not exceed 10% and no differences were found among habitats. Soil bulk density was elevated relative to un-logged areas only on log landings one and four years after logging, and this difference disappeared by eight years post logging. The total area disturbed by logging varied from 7.0% to 8.6% with nearly half of the totals in felling gaps (3.0-3.7%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How Can the Environmental Efficiency of Indonesian Cocoa Farms Be Increased?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing global cocoa demand in the new millennium has triggered farmers in developing countries to expand cocoa cultivation. A challenge is how to sustainably increase cocoa production without causing deforestation. We examine this trade-off around the Lore Lindu National Park in Indonesia and investigate the determinants of environmental efficiency by applying a distance output function that includes cocoa production and rainforest plant abundance. We analyze 208 cocoa producers' variables from 2015 using both measured and self-reported data. We find that cocoa intensification results in higher ecosystem degradation, and that producers in our sample display a 50% mean efficiency. This low value points to the increased infestation of cocoa pod borer and the failure of the Gemas government program. Increasing efficiency could lead to a win-win-win situation: higher cocoa production from fewer hectares, and with more native rainforest plants co-existing with cocoa on those hectares. On average, efficiency scores suggest that there is scope to expand production by 367 kg of cocoa per farm and year on the existing planted area, to increase rainforest plants per 5*5 m area by 109 while maintaining existing areas and production levels, or to reduce acreage by 0.52 ha per farm without reducing production.

TI  - A new park in the Bolivian Gran Chaco - An advance in tropical dry forest conservation and community-based management
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management area was established in September 1995. At 3.44 million hectares it is one of South America's largest protected areas. The tropical dry forest of the Chaco, which this reserve protects, is Bolivia's most threatened major lowland habitat type. With the creation of this reserve the protected-area coverage of the Gran Chaco increased to 4.7 per cent. With at least 69 species of mammals (the Chiroptera have not yet been surveyed), it is one of the richest Neotropical sites for this taxonomic group. The Kaa-lya park is being administered by the Izoceno-Guarani Indian organization, the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Izozog, and puts community-based conservation into practice. Threats to the park include encroachment by colonists, ranchers and farmers; the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline; and hunting.

T2  - Acta Amazonica
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we discuss aspects of the floristic composition and Structure of a stand of dense tropical rain forest subjected to low-impact logging practices. We conducted the study in a 3,200 ha forest management unit located in the north portion of the Tapajos National Forest (Para, Brazil), where a mean timber volume of 23.7 m(3) ha(-1) had been extracted. To represent the variability existing within the experimental area, we randomly selected six I ha sample plots in different exploitation blocks. The floristic-structural analyses were made at two distinct scales: (a) at a management unit level, for a global characterization of the forest stand in which later studies will be performed; and (b) at a sample plot level, to aid the study of remote sensing data, given the observed floristic-structural variations. The results showed that the forest management unit hosts a high floristic diversity (Shannon-Weaver index equals 4.22). The stand is characterized by a high individuals/species concentration in few botanical families, and by a high number of locally rare species. Analysis of the floristic-structural variations between sample plots showed statistically significant differences in species diversity and similarity, and in mean total height values. In addition, we noted significant variability in the structural metrics such as the distribution of diameters and the estimated timber volume.

T2  - Revista Brasileira de Botanica
M3  - Article
AB  - (Impact of invasion and management of molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora) on the native vegetation of the Brazilian Savanna). In Brazil, several grass species are cited as invaders of protected areas. However, little is known about the impacts due to establishment and colonization of these species in protected areas in Brazil. Among the exotic grasses introduced into the Cerrado the African species Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv., molasses grass, deserves special mention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of this grass on the biomass and species richness of the native community in an area of invaded Cerrado as well as to study the dynamics of the vegetation of the ground layer after different management treatments for control of molasses grass. The results showed that in the experimental area, where molasses grass composed 62% of the total biomass of the around layer, the number of native species was high. In the areas where molasses grass had a high degree of coverage (> 98%) its biomass was approximately two times higher than values cited in other studies in the Cerrado. Between three and four years after using fire as a management tool for control of molasses grass its biomass returned to values similar to those observed prior to this treatment. Contrarily, with an integrated management treatment (May or September) a reduction of 99.9% in the presence of molasses grass was observed along with a recovery of native vegetation, making this a promising strategy for recuperation of areas in the Cerrado that were invaded by molasses grass.

TI  - Three decades of deforestation in southwest Sumatra: Effects of coffee prices, law enforcement and rural poverty
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ conservation of tropical forests often requires restricting human use and occupancy within protected areas by enforcing regulations. However, law enforcement interventions that seek to prevent deforestation rarely have been evaluated. Conservationists increasingly recognize the need to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, using an indicator of biodiversity change, such as rate of deforestation, and a counterfactual approach that addresses a fundamental question: what would have happened had there been no intervention? This study examines how law enforcement can mitigate habitat loss from small-holder coffee growing by comparing 34 years of empirical data on deforestation rates and coffee prices across a zone of high law enforcement and a zone of low law enforcement using satellite imagery, ecological data, interviews, and GIS modeling..In the early 1980s strong law enforcement efforts were found to reduce deforestation inside Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP), southwest Sumatra. However, law enforcement efforts were weak in remote areas of BBSNP, where high coffee prices spurred rapid deforestation. Furthermore, law enforcement efforts were reversed by the 1997-1998 Asian economic crisis. the fall of the national president, and by new regulations surrounding regional autonomy. These findings indicate that law enforcement is critical but insufficient alone. They also highlight that rising costs of agricultural commodities can be detrimental to tropical forests and their associated biodiversity. In the long run one must act to decrease the incentives for coffee cultivation. A multi-faceted strategy that includes law enforcement and incentives to reduce poverty around PAS is proposed.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) across a habitat disturbance gradient in Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung beetles are important component of most terrestrial ecosystems and used to assess the effects of habitat disturbance and deforestation. This study aimed at comparing dung beetle assemblages among several habitat types ranging from natural tropical forest and agroforestry systems to open cultivated areas at the margin of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), Central Sulawesi (one of Indonesia's biodiversity hotspots). Therefore, 10 pitfall traps baited with cattle dung were exposed at each habitat type (n = 4 replicate sites per habitat type) to collect the dung beetles. The results showed that species richness of dung beetles declined significantly from natural forest to open area. However cacao agroforestry systems seemed to be capable of maintaining a high portion of dung beetle species inhabiting at forest sites. The closer relationship between dung beetle assemblages recorded at forest and agroforestry sites reflects the high similarity of some measured habitat parameters (e.g. vegetation structure and microclimate) between both habitat types, while species assemblages at open areas differed significantly from both other habitat groups. These results indicated that habitat type has importance effect on determining the species richness and community structure of dung beetles at the margin of LLNP.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in microaggregates of no-tillage soils with different clay mineralogy
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of diagnostic soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and the mechanisms controlling their formation and turnover is critical for better understanding of C dynamics in soils. Enhanced microaggregate formation and stabilization of C due to reduced macroaggregate turnover has been proposed as a mechanism promoting C sequestration in no-tillage (NT) compared with conventional tillage (CT) systems in temperate soils dominated by 2:1 clay mineralogy. We evaluated the contribution of macroaggregate-protected microaggregates to total soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in NT relative to CT in three soils differing in clay mineralogy: a 2:1 claydominated soil (2:1), a soil with mixed clay mineralogy [2:1 and 1:1] and oxides (mixed), and a soil dominated by (1:1) clay minerals and oxides (1:1). Microaggregates (mM) were isolated from macroaggregates from 0- to 5- and 5- to 20-cm soil layers. Particulate organic matter (POM) located within the microaggregates (intra-mM-POM) was separated from POM outside of the microaggregates (inter-mMPONI) and the mineral fraction of the microaggregates (mineral-mM). In all three soils, total SOC as well as microaggregate-associated C (mM-C) was greater with NT compared with CT. Although less than half of the total SOC under NT was associated with the microaggregate fraction, more than 90% of the total difference in SOC between NT and CT was explained by the difference in mM-C in all three soils. Thus, we identified and isolated a fraction that explains almost the entire difference in total SOC between NT and CT across soils characterized by drastically different clay mineralogy.

We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in Southeast Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.

TI  - Slash and burn management and permanent or rotation agroforestry systems: A comparative study for C sequestration by century model simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of agroforestry systems (AFs) on soil organic carbon (SOC) requires long-term ex-periments, but scenarios simulations can anticipate the potential of these systems to sequester or lose carbon (C). This study aimed to simulate the SOC dynamics in slash and burn management (BURN) and AFs using the Century model. Data from a long-term experiment implemented in the Brazilian semiarid region were used to simulate SOC dynamics under BURN and AFs situations, and the natural vegetation (NV) "Caatinga" as a reference. BURN scenarios considered different fallow periods (0, 7, 15, 30, 50 and 100 years) among cultivation of the same area. The two types of AFs (agrosilvopastoral-AGP and silvopastoral-SILV) were simulated in two contrasting conditions: (i) each one of the AFs and also NV area were permanently conducted with no rotation among these areas; and (ii) the two AFs and NV rotated among them every 7 years. The correlation coefficients (r), coefficients of determination (CD) and coefficients of residual mass (CRM) showed adequate performance, meaning that the Century model is able to reproduce the SOC stocks in the slash and burn management and AFs situations. The equilibrium points of NV SOC stocks stabilized around 30.3 Mg ha-1, as similar to the measured average of 28.4 Mg ha-1 at field conditions. The adoption of BURN without a fallow period (0 years) resulted in a reduction of 50% of SOC, approximately 20 Mg ha-1, after the first 10 years. Permanent (p) and rotating (r) AFs management systems recovered (in 10 years) fast to the original SOC stocks, resulting in higher SOC stocks than NV SOC at equilibrium. The fallow period of 50 years is necessary to recovery SOC stocks in the Caatinga biome. The simulation shows that the AFs systems increase more SOC stocks than observed in natural vegetation in long-term.

TI  - Interactive effects of fire and grazing on vegetation structure and plant species composition in subtropical grasslands
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionFire and grazing, and their interaction, are the main drivers of vegetation structure and plant species composition in many grasslands globally. However, for subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil, the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant community composition characteristics remain relatively understudied, even though this ecosystem is recognized as fire-dependent with critical importance for livestock grazing.LocationSubtropical grassland in southern Brazil (Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul state).MethodsBeginning in 2017, we established an experiment with three treatments: fire only (F), grazing only (G), and fire and grazing (F + G). Grazing was continuous with ca 1.1 animal unit per hectare annually and prescribed fires were applied annually in winter. We assessed vegetation structure (via percentage of bare soil, height of canopy, and available forage) and plant species composition during spring (November) and summer (March) of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (only summer season).ResultsDifferences in vegetation structure were found among treatments, wherein bare soil, height of canopy and available forage were higher in F, and lower but similar in F + G and G. Plant species richness was equal among treatments, but cover of C3 grasses was higher in F than in other treatments, and shrub cover was lower in F and F + G in comparison to G. In F + G treatment, available biomass for subsequent burning was limited, resulting in lower amounts of fuel, reduced fire spread, and ultimately less total area burned in the subsequent years.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that interaction of fire and grazing can be a useful vegetation management tool for conserving native plant species, increasing availability of more desirable forage plants, and decreasing shrubs (including toxic Senecio species which contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids). The singular and interactive effects of fire and grazing suggest the subhumid R & iacute;o de la Plata grasslands are a fire-adapted ecosystem with variable plant functional trait responses facilitating differential dominance. There is a need for future work to address spatio-temporal variability and vegetation heterogeneity.Fire and grazing, and their interaction, are the main drivers of vegetation structure and plant species composition in many grasslands globally.

TI  - Conservation value of cacao agroforestry for amphibians and reptiles in South-East Asia: combining correlative models with follow-up field experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - P>Although agricultural expansion is a primary threat to tropical biodiversity, experimental studies evaluating the conservation value of tropical agricultural habitats are scarce. In particular, little is known about the sensitivity of amphibians and reptiles to habitat disturbance in areas of very high diversity such as South-East Asia.We used a two-step approach to determine the relationship between habitat complexity and conservation value of cacao agroforestry for herpetological diversity in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Indonesia is the third largest cacao-exporting country globally and forest conversion to cacao plantations is a major threat to its biodiversity. We first sampled 43 cacao plantations six times to determine the environmental variables that best explained herpetofaunal diversity patterns using a Bayesian model selection approach. Based on these results, we experimentally manipulated leaf litter thickness (LLT), number of branch piles (LOGS) and LLT + LOGS combinations in the cacao plots. The experimental data were analysed using Bayesian hierarchical regression.The best supported correlative models incorporated LLT, LOGS, air temperature and the ratio between leaf litter and shrub cover, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and suggesting climate change sensitivity. The subsequent structural manipulation of these attributes changed amphibian and reptile species richness, and reptile abundance, but only addition of leaf litter did so in a biologically meaningful way, providing microhabitat resources. However, the main beneficiaries were common disturbance-tolerant reptiles.Synthesis and applications. The different results from the correlative model and the independent manipulative experiments showed how important such a combined approach is to derive adequate conservation management recommendations. Increasing leaf litter in cacao agroforestry will work best if implemented on a landscape scale to incorporate sufficient environmental variation and species life histories. This will mainly enhance the richness and abundance of disturbance-tolerant species, which still may maintain ecosystem functions such as pest removal. Particularly for rare species, native forests remain critical for herpetological richness. The direct temperature sensitivity suggests that future climate change impacts may be severe for herpetological diversity in plantation habitats and, hence, demand further research.

TI  - Environmental drivers of harvestmen assemblages (Arachnida: Opiliones) from Neotropical rainforest landscapes
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of environmental conditions on biodiversity may provide cues regarding the resilience of ecological communities facing human activities in tropical forests. Under this scenario, harvestmen are among the most ideal models for understanding the ecological dynamics associated with shifts in environmental conditions. In this study, we evaluated how changes in attributes related to environmental conditions shape harvestmen assemblages in the Atlantic Forest. We assessed the effect of environmental transformation in four forest fragments with different proportions of native forest cover based on their environmental attributes (temperature, humidity, leaf litter depth and cover, and herbaceous vegetation cover) on harvestmen species richness, abundance, and composition. Overall, 865 harvestmen individuals belonging to six families and 41 species were sampled. The effects of environmental conditions on harvestmen assemblages were context-dependent. In the most conserved fragment, there was an increase in harvestmen richness and abundance with increasing temperature. Furthermore, herbaceous vegetation cover negatively affected harvestmen richness and abundance. Species turnover was the main driver of harvestmen beta diversity in all forest fragments. With the results presented herein, we demonstrate that harvestmen species richness and abundance are modulated by landscape modifications and subsequent alterations in the environment resulting from human-induced disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental transformations at a large spatial scale (i.e., landscape) and local scale (i.e., environmental attributes) to design appropriate conservation strategies for Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - The Zo'e perspective on what scientists call "forest management" and its implications for floristic diversity and biocultural conservation
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous perspectives on forest management are grounded in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), so that socioculture influences the ways Indigenous Peoples transform their landscapes. However, how socioculture structures Indigenous perspectives on forest management is unclear. Moreover, little is known about the influence of Indigenous landscape transformations on forest succession and floristic diversity. Here, we test hypotheses from biocultural and ecological theories suggesting that: (i) key social-ecological relationships with specific taxa structure Indigenous perspectives on forest management; (ii) such relationships guide sustainable management that generates resilient forest regrowth; and (iii) this management promotes floristic diversity by acting as an intermediate disturbance. We collected information about cosmology, occupation history and management among the Zo`e, in Brazilian Amazonia. We also carried out floristic inventories in old-growth forests and in old Zo`e swidden-fallow areas to analyze forest structure and alpha-and beta-diversity along a gradient of forest successional stages. We show that the Zo`e perspective on forest management is structured by an ethical principle involving a social-ecological relationship with different beings, especially the spider monkey (Ateles sp.). This relationship generates mobility among the Zo`e that allows forest regrowth in their fallow areas, so that in 28 years, forest basal area may equal that of old-growth forests. Also, Zo`e forest management has increased alpha-and beta-diversity by increasing species richness and diversity in intermediate secondary forests and promoting floristic turnover at the landscape-level. These results show that some aspects of Zo`e cosmology influence forest disturbance regimes that generate a sustainable social-ecological system, therefore being key for Zo`e well-being and local biodiversity conservation. We believe that Indigenous perspectives about forest management should be included in forest conservation efforts aimed at protecting Amazonian biocultural diversity, thus valuing TEK and engendering sustainable social-ecological systems.

TI  - Choice of macroinvertebrate metrics to evaluate stream conditions in Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of biomonitoring programs based on the macroinvertebrate community requires the understanding of species distribution patterns, as well as of the responses of the community to anthropogenic stressors. In this study, 49 metrics were tested as potential means of assessing the condition of 29 first- and second-order streams located in areas of differing types of land use in So Paulo State, Brazil. Of the sampled streams, 15 were in well-preserved regions in the Atlantic Forest, 5 were among sugarcane cultivations, 5 were in areas of pasture, and 4 were among eucalyptus plantations. The metrics were assessed against the following criteria: (1) predictable response to the impact of human activity; (2) highest taxonomic resolution, and (3) operational and theoretical simplicity. We found that 18 metrics were correlated with the environmental and spatial predictors used, and seven of these satisfied the selection criteria and are thus candidates for inclusion in a multimetric system to assess low-order streams in So Paulo State. These metrics are family richness; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) richness; proportion of Megaloptera and Hirudinea; proportion of EPT; Shannon diversity index for genus; and adapted Biological Monitoring Work Party biotic index.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and physical properties under no-till and conventional tillage cotton-based systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate soil C and N stocks and soil physical properties under a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) based system using no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experiment was established as a randomized block design with four replications of six treatments as follows: [NT1], NT system with crop rotation of cotton/soybean (Glycine max)/maize (Zea mays)+brachiaria (Brachiaria ruziziensis); [NT2], NT system with crop rotation of soybean/maize+brachiaria/cotton; [NT3], NT system with crop rotation of maize+brachiaria/cotton/soybean; [CR1], CT with annual rotation (soybean/cotton); and [CR2], CT with biannual rotation (soybean/soybean/cotton) and [CT1] CT with cotton monoculture. An area of native Cerrado vegetation was used as the reference or baseline. Soil samples were obtained from 0- to 5-, 5- to 10-, 10- to 20-, 20- to 30-, 30- to 60-, and 60- to 100-cm depths. After 9years of cultivation, soil under NT systems contained higher C concentrations than those under CT (p<0.05); however, significant differences were restricted to the 0- to 5-cm layer. Stocks of C and N in the 0- to 30-cm depth ranged from 36.2 to 39.8Mgha(-1) and from 2.00 to 2.22Mgha(-1), respectively. Despite higher C concentration in the upper layer, NT treatments (NT1, NT2, and NT3) had soil C stocks similar to those of CR1 and CT1. In comparison with Cerrado, C stocks in soil under all cultivated treatments were reduced by 27% in the top 1-m depth, which represents a C loss of 35Mg C ha(-1) upon conversion from the Cerrado to cultivated land. The least soil bulk density among all treatments was observed for NT1. However, there were no differences in macroporosity and microporosity among NT and CT systems even after 9years of cultivation. In comparison with CT, principal benefits of NT systems for C sequestration and soil physical improvements are restricted to the surface layer.

AB  - Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is one of important industrial plants in Indonesia. It is planted widely in some provinces in Indonesia, one of which is in West Java under management of the PTPN VIII plantation, Subang Regency. Intercropping system using underutilized crops Canna sp. (Ganyong) had been introduced on Rubber plantation. The aim of this research is to analyze the diversity, abundance and richness of rhizosphere soil microbial under rubber-canna agroforestry system using metagenomic analysis of 16S rRNA gene of soil rhizosphere bacteria. The research was carried out by collecting soil samples from 2 different soil conditions (soils with Canna (G) and soils without Canna (TG)). 2 different soil depths conditions (20 and 40 cm) were also investigated. The results showed that number of microbial in G soils was found more abundance than in TG soils, while based on soil depth there was no significant effect on soil microbial abundance. Based on class level was found 84 Classes. There were 3 classes that are mostly found in G and TG, namely Ktedonobacteria, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetia. Microbial diversity in family level mostly found in G and TG, Namely Koribacteraceae, Gemmataceae, Synobacteraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae.

TI  - Evaluating Sustainability in Traditional Silvopastoral Systems (caivas): Looking Beyond the Impact of Animals on Biodiversity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Caivas are traditional silvopastoral systems that occur in the Araucaria Forest biome, Southern Brazil, in which animal production and erva-mate extraction are integrated. Participatory research was conducted in caivas in the Northern Plateau, Santa Catarina State, to identify strategies to intensify pasture use and increase animal productivity. To better understand the outcomes of these strategies, a sustainability assessment was conducted in properties that participated in the research (improved caivas; IC) and those that did not (traditional caivas; TC). The Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) tool 2.0.0 for smallholders was chosen as it evaluates the productive unit as a whole using environmental, social, economic, and governance indicators and is tailored for small-scale production. All evaluated indicators showed higher scores for IC properties in relation to TC. In general, the SAFA analysis showed that when evaluated as productive systems, TCs are a strategic option for rural development, as 65% of their indicators were evaluated as good. With the support of rural outreach and research and the adoption of appropriate technologies, this percentage increased to 86% in ICs. These results confirm that with adequate support caivas can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable livestock farming in Southern Brazil.

TI  - Genetic Diversity of Dominant Plant Species in Tropical Land-Use Systems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity hotspots like tropical lowland rainforests in Sumatra are threatened by the agricultural expansion, which increases the deforestation rate in Indonesia, which is highest worldwide. Main land-use change drivers in Indonesia include the production of rubber and palm oil, both of which lead to a high forest conversion rate. In the remaining and degraded forest patches, species diversity has declined and species composition has been altered. Effects of habitat fragmentation and land-use change on genetic structure were frequently investigated at the species level and compared across plant species, but not for plant communities. In addition, the effect of land-use change on the genetic structure of plants has not yet been investigated. Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism marker, the genetic diversity of 112 dominant plant species was assessed in four different land-use systems in Sumatra: old growth tropical lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation. The four systems were investigated in two regions with four replicates, respectively. Because of different species compositions, characterized by different life history traits, forest and jungle rubber plots showed the highest diversity level, while oil palm and rubber plantations showed the lower diversity levels. The two intensively managed plantation systems showed similar genetic diversity levels as the tree dominated systems but are dominated by mainly alien species. This indicates that oil palm and rubber plantations could not be identified as habitats of conservational value. The newly introduced collection and analysis approach presents a universally applicable method to investigate different ecosystems in their plant genetic diversity to support the identification of habitats with high conservational value.

TI  - Multi-year double cropping biochar field trials in Nepal: Finding the optimal biochar dose through agronomic trials and cost-benefit analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor water and nutrient retention are the major soil fertility limitations in the low productivity agricultural soils of Nepal. The addition of biochar to these soils is one way these hindrances can be overcome. In the present study, six different biochar doses (control, 5 t ha(-1), 10 t ha(-1), 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha(-1)) were applied to amoderately acidic silty loam soil from Rasuwa, Nepal and the effects on soil physicochemical properties and maize and mustard yield over three years (i.e., six cropping seasons), were investigated. Biochar addition did not show significant effects on maize and mustard grain yield in the first year, however significant positive effects (p < 0.01) were observed during the second and third years. During the second year, maize grain yield significantly increased by 50%, 47% and 93% and mustard grain yield by 96%, 128% and 134% at 15 t ha(-1), 25 t ha(-1) and 40 t ha-1 of biochar respectively. A similar significant increase in yield of both crops was observed in the third year. Yields for both maize and mustard correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with plant available P, K+, pH, total OC%, CEC, base saturation, and increased as a function of biochar addition.On the basis of the measured crop yields for the various biochar doses, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out, and gross margin was calculated to optimize biochar dose for local farming practice. Total costs included financial cost (farm input, labor and biochar production cost), health cost and methane emission cost during biochar production. Health costs were a minor factor (< 2% of total biochar preparation cost), whereas methane emission costs were significant (up to 30% of biochar cost, depending on the C price). Total income comprised sale of crops and carbon sequestration credits. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the optimal biochar application dose was 15 t ha(-1) for all C price scenarios, increasing gross margin by 21% and 53%, respectively, for 0 and 42 US$ per ton CO2 price scenarios. In the current situation, only the 0 US$ price scenario is realistic for rural farmers in Nepal, but this still gives benefits of biochar amendment, which are capped at a 15 t ha(-1) biochar addition.

TI  - Effects of reduced impact logging on bat biodiversity in terra firme forest of lowland Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Timber harvest is one of the main causes of degradation of Amazonian tropical forests, where bats represent important components of biodiversity. In addition, bats may represent keystone taxa in the Neotropics, as they are primary agents of pollination and seed dispersal for many pioneer plants. We assessed the impact of low harvest (18 m(3)/ha), reduced impact logging (RIL) on population and community characteristics of phyllostomid bats in Amazonian terra firme forest of Brazil at 20-42 months post-harvest. Based on 1-03,680 net-meter-hours of netting in Tapajo's National Forest, 2341 phyllostomids were captured, representing 42 species, 25 genera, and 4 broad feeding guilds. Population-level responses of common phyllostomids to RIL were minor, with 10 of 15 species evincing no change in mean abundance. Of those taxa. responding to RIL (mean difference in number of individuals per site), three increased (Artibeus concolor [0.46 individuals], Artibeus lituratus [3.88], and Glossophaga soricina [0.71]) and two decreased (Carollia brevicauda [0.96] and Carollia perspicillata [14.04]) in abundance. Compositional (species distributions) and structural (rank distributions) aspects of bat assemblages differed between cut and control forests. More specifically, bat assemblages in cut forest had increased diversity and decreased dominance compared to control forest. Nonetheless, the proportional abundance of the five most common species, as a group, was similar in cut (86%) and control forest (88%), and frugivores dominated assemblages in both management types. Mean abundance of frugivores decreased (10.59 individuals per site) in response to RIL; however, this response was driven by decreases in C. perspicillata, the most abundant species in terra firme forest. Although RIL had only minor effects on biodiversity in the short-term, extrapolation to a long-term prospectus should be exercised with caution when applied to conservation or policy issues.

TI  - Impact of controlled sugarcane straw burning on local insect community
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The previous burning of sugarcane straw before harvest causes a series of inconvenients to the environment, specially to the tillage-associated insects. Fire is used to control pests and diseases in the agriculture, however its effect on insect populations is not well understood or documented, mainly on invertebrate groups responsible for nutrient recycling and energy flow. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of controlled burning sugarcane straw on the local insect community. The insects were collected in different dates before and after burning. The species selected for the analysis were affected by fire. Among the 35 taxa collected, 17 were considered more relevant to explain the observed variation in the frequency of species captured through time. In the first sampling after burning, there was a decrease in abundance of five species [Nitidulidae (species 2; Coleoptera), Lutosa brasiliensis (Brunner von Watternwyl) (Orthoptera: Gryllacrididae), Phoridae e Drosophilidae (Diptera) e Labia minor L. (Dermaptera: Labiidae)], among the 17 species selected for analysis. The canonical variate analysis for different sampling dates indicated significant difference between treatments, considering the composition and the species abundance. Despite the different composition of the insect community observed before and after burning, there is a tendency of community recovery to the observed pattern before burning.

TI  - Different burning intensities affect cavity utilization patterns by arboreal ants in a tropical savanna canopy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural disturbance in many ecosystems worldwide, including tropical savannas, where it drives the assembly of animal and plant communities. The effect of fire is often indirect, impacting the availability of essential resources like food and shelter. The Brazilian Cerrado is the largest tropical savanna in the world, and ants comprise a very high proportion of its animal biomass. About one-third of the Cerrado ant fauna actively forages in the canopy. These ants use trees not just in search of food but also as their main shelter resource, as most arboreal ants nest mainly in cavities produced by wood-boring beetles. While it seems clear that fire can have important direct and indirect effects on arboreal ants, the number of studies using an experimental approach focusing on such impacts is relatively few. Here, we aimed to understand the impacts of fire on arboreal ants usage of shelter resources. Moreover, we also evaluated the potential influence of different fire intensities on these resources usage. For this, we assessed the colonization rates of experimental cavities under four different burning intensities: control, low-intensity, intermediate-intensity, and high-intensity. We hypothesized that fire would have a detrimental effect on cavity occupation. This effect would be stronger in higher intensity burns, once they can dramatically decrease the availability of natural cavities and, thus, the abundance and richness of arboreal ants. We also predicted that some ant species would be indicative of different fire intensities, due to differences in heat tolerance and colony size. Our data showed that fire had a major positive effect on experimental cavity use by arboreal ants, with more ant species, more colonized trees, and higher cavity occupation under fire treatments. This effect was higher with the increase of fire intensity. Some ant species were found more commonly on distinct fire treatments, which was mainly due to their different nesting site requirements and colony sizes. Jointly, these results show that fire affects arboreal ant cavity colonization patterns, and that fire intensity is extremely critical in shaping these patterns. Altogether, our work offers important insights for a better understanding of the effects of ecological disturbances on resource use patterns of a highly abundant and diverse organism.

TI  - Indigenous agroforestry in tropical Asia: Structure and dynamics. A comparative analysis of two case studies
T2  - Mitteilungen der Eidgenoessischen Forschungsanstalt fuer Wald Schnee und Landschaft
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical indigenous agroforestry systems have met these recent years with a growing interest among scientists. Two case studies are presented here: one in southern Sri Lanka, a very anthropized area, and one in Central Sumatra (Indonesia), a still largely forested area. The vegetal structure of agroforests is analysed with the architectural method using profile diagrams, together with classical forestry data. The comparison of the results enables to elaborate a dynamical typology of the systems in both situations, exemplified by several characteristic situations. A schematic general description of the development of indigenous agroforestry systems is proposed. The similitudes of this development with natural silvigenesis are enhanced. The origin and evolution of these man-made ecosystems are eventually discussed in relationship with other land use systems. The agroforests of both areas show important similarities in their structure and functions. Furthermore, structural values are close from those measured in natural forests, thus allowing the conservation of a high biodiversity. The structural approach has however to be considered only as one among other ways for analysing such agroforestry systems. Large differences in other aspects urge to pluridisciplinary studies in any conservation or development project.

TI  - Diversifying Incomes and Losing Landscape Complexity in Quilombola Shifting Cultivation Communities of the Atlantic Rainforest (Brazil)
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation systems have been blamed as the primary cause of tropical deforestation and are being transformed through various forms of conservation and development policies and through the emergence of new markets for cash crops. Here, we analyze the outcomes of different policies on land use/land cover change (LUCC) in a traditional, shifting cultivation landscape in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil), one of the world's top biodiversity hotspots. We also investigate the impacts of those policies on the environment and local livelihoods in Quilombola communities, which are formed by descendants of former Maroon colonies. Our findings show that conservation and social policies have had mixed effects both on the conservation of the Atlantic Forest and on the livelihoods of the Quilombola. We conclude that future interventions in the region need to build on the new, functional links between sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity, where less restrictive state policies leave room for new opportunities in self-organization and innovation.

TI  - Floristic evolution in an agroforestry system cultivation in Southern Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella Bentham) is an important pioneer tree species in Ombrophylous Mixed Forest of Brazil and is widely used as an energy source. In traditional agroforestry systems, regeneration is induced by fire, then pure and dense stands known as bracatinga stands (bracatingais) are formed. In the first year, annual crops are intercalated with the seedlings. At that time the seedlings are thinned, then the stands remain at a fallow period and cut at seven years old. The species is very important mainly for small landowners. We studied the understory species that occur naturally during the succession over several years in order to manage them rationally in the future and maintain the natural vegetation over time. Three to 20 year-old Bracatinga stands were sampled between 1998 and 2011. All tree species with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were measured. The floristic evolution was assessed with respect to Sociability Index, the Shannon Diversity Index and the Pielou Evenness Index. Graphs of rank/abundance over different age groups were evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We identified 153 species dispersed throughout the understory and tend to become aggregated over time.

TI  - Crop diversity and classification of homegardens in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Homegardens are considered a sustainable production system in the tropics, which contributes to biodiversity conservation. The aim of this study was the description of crop diversity, structure and management of homegardens in Central Sulawesi and their classification. In 30 homegardens randomly selected from three villages adjacent to the Lore Lindu National Park, species diversity and abundance were assessed and the Shannon index was calculated. Overall 149 crop species were identified, mainly fruit, vegetable, spice, or medicinal plants. The number of vegetation layers differed depending on age and size of homegardens. Cluster analysis of crop species composition was used to classify different garden types. Not only the spectrum of species cultivated in the homegardens but also the occurrence of these garden types was different among the three villages. This finding was supported by Sorensen's coefficient. Homegardens from one village, mainly inhabited by transmigrants, contrasted strongly with those from the other two. A markedly lower number of crop species was cultivated there, and species composition was clearly different. The number of crop species and species composition found in homegardens may be attributed to socio-economic conditions of garden keepers as well as to soil quality. Both productivity and sustainability can be enhanced, e.g., by improved soil fertility management such as applying available farm yard manure.

TI  - Landscape approaches; what are the pre-conditions for success?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape approaches are widely applied in attempts to reconcile tradeoffs amongst different actors with conflicting demands on land and water resources. Key principles for landscape approaches have been endorsed by inter-governmental processes dealing with climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation.We review experiences from seven landscapes located in the Congo Basin, Eastern Indonesia and Northern Australia. Landscape initiatives were applied in situations where large-scale extractive industries, local peoples' livelihoods and global biodiversity objectives were in conflict. We found that common published principles for landscape approaches are not applied systematically in the areas studied. Practitioners draw upon landscape approach principles selectively and adapt them to deal with local conditions. We consider that landscape approaches do not provide silver bullet solutions to these situations nor do they provide an operational framework for large-scale land management. Landscape approaches do, however, provide an organising framework for disentangling the complexity of the landscape and facilitating the investigation of impacts of different courses of action. They enable alternative scenarios for what future landscapes might look like to be investigated and they create the space for multi-stakeholder negotiations. Outcomes from landscape scale approaches are determined by the power differentials amongst stakeholders and the existence, or otherwise, of functional institutions to take decisions and enforce agreements. Landscape approaches cannot overcome disparities in power or entrenched interests nor can they substitute for institutions with authority to establish and legitimise property and resource rights. They can, however, provide a mechanism around which civil society can be mobilised to achieve better land use outcomes. Landscape approaches are successful when they have strong leadership, sustained long-term and facilitated processes, good governance, adequate budgets and adequate metrics for assessing progress. Private sector engagement is necessary and all parties must have sufficient shared interest in outcomes to motivate their participation.

TI  - Organic matter and aggregation of a planosol under different forest coverings
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The litter quality can alter soil aggregation, modifying the transformation dynamics and allocation of soil carbon (C) in different compartments. This study evaluated the aggregate stability and its relation with litter chemical characteristics, organic carbon and free light fraction (FLL) from the organic matter under three different types of vegetation covering: secondary forest (FS) and plantings of Mimosa Caesalpiniaefolia (PM) and Carapa guianenses (PA) with subsequently natural regeneration. Litter samples were characterized using polyfenols, lignin, suberine, tannin and holocelulose content and ON relationship. Soil samples were collected in two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) and soil aggregation were estimate using mean weight diameter (DMP), mean geometric diameter (DMG) and index of aggregate stability (IPA) analysis. Soil samples in the same depths were also characterized using C and FLL content. The highest suberine and polyfenols content of the litter found in the areas FS and PM reduced the speed of residues decomposition in the soil causing larger FLL content in both coverings. Those compositions contributed to the stabilization of C in the mineral phase, because the highest C content was found in those areas. This fact is confirmed by the values of DMP, DMG and IEA among the areas. They are higher in the coverings, PM and FS. It can be concluded that the polyfenols and suberine content were decisive in the subdivision of C and in the aggregation of the soil in the areas of FS and PM.

TI  - Fractions of Organic Matter and Soil Carbon Balance in Different Phases of an Agroforestry System in the Cerrado: A Ten-Year Field Assessment
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated production systems composed of trees, crops and pastures have shown good results in improving soil quality and the capacity to store carbon in the soil, being efficient in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, changes in carbon stocks and soil organic matter fractions in the initial stages of implementing an agroforestry system remain unclear. This study evaluated the carbon balance and the dynamics of soil organic matter fractions in an agroforestry system conducted over a decade. Total carbon, labile carbon, carbon from particulate organic matter, organic carbon associated with minerals and inert carbon were determined at depths 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm. Soil carbon stocks were also estimated for the 0-40 cm depth. Total carbon increased in the agroforestry system compared with a low-productivity pasture. The total carbon stock in the last growing season (68.57 Mg ha(-1)) was close to the original soil stocks under native Cerrado vegetation (76.5 Mg ha(-1)). After 10 years, there was a positive balance in the soil carbon stock of both the total carbon and the soil organic matter fractions. The successional agroforestry system is a good alternative to increasing soil total carbon stocks and labile and non-labile fractions of soil organic matter.

TI  - Human-climate interactions shape fire regimes in the Cerrado of Sa∼o Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is the most diverse tropical savanna in the world. As a fire-prone ecosystem, natural fire in the Cerrado shapes plant communities and drives evolutionary processes. Human activities and landscape management can alter natural fire regimes and reshape Cerrado dynamics, making biodiversity conservation a challenge, particularly in densely populated areas. We reconstructed the historical fire regime of three protected areas (PA) and their buffer zones in Sa similar to o Paulo state to understand how current fire exclusion policies are affecting fire regimes and to measure how human-climate-fire relationships can change in areas under different land management. We used Landsat satellite imagery, from 1984 to 2017, with 30 m of spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution. In total, we mapped 49,471 ha of burned area, and we detected variations in fire frequency and fire size among sites. PA dominated by open savanna in Itirapina concentrated 93 % of all observed fires, while PA dominated by forest-like formations in Assis represented only 2% of the fires. Annual rainfall showed a very weak relationship (R2 = 0.04) with annual total burned area, while the rainfall split between dry and wet seasons showed a tendency to have a fuel moisture effect which determined the vegetation available to burn in the dry season (R2 = 0.09). Fire regimes in PA were similar to those observed in buffer zones suggesting that fire-exclusion policies do not effectively prevent fires in PA that are surrounded by an anthropic matrix where fire is often used. When we included human factors in addition to rainfall, our models explained 44 % of variation of burned areas. We conclude that fire regimes in Sa similar to o Paulo Cerrado have been modified by humans and that fire exclusion is not a suitable policy for protected areas in this fire-prone ecosystem.

TI  - USING GEOESTATISTICS FOR ASSESSING BIODIVERSITY OF FOREST RESERVE AREAS
T2  - Bragantia
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting natural mosaics as forest reserves poses a challenge, because if they hold significant high levels of biodiversity, they may function as key seed sources for regenerating ecosystems and adjacent reforested areas. Currently, there is lack of information about the spatial organization of native species in core forest fragments remaining between reforested fields. Biodiversity as measured by species and number of individuals was assessed in two forest reserve zones located within reforestations of Eucalyptus sp and Pin us sp in Agudos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The main objective was to compare the state of biodiversity within two natural areas with contrasting disturbance levels; a second objective was to investigate recognisable patterns of species and individuals spatial distribution. A grid-like set of plots was set up for data collection over each of the two study areas. Natural species were aggregated onto two groups using height classes, inferior level (< 0.5 m) and superior level (> 1.3 m) layers. Within each natural area the number of species and individuals of the height class > 1.3 m was counted on 50 square plots of 100 m(2) (10 x 10 m) whereas those of the height class < 0.5 m were counted on 250 subplots of 1 m(2) (1 x 1 m). Data analysis involved both statistical and geostatistical methods. Experimental semivariograms of number of species and individuals were modelled by a nugget component plus a spherical structure with autocorrelation ranging from approximately 20 to 60 m. Cross-semivariograms could also be computed and modelled in some cases. Nugget effects of both species and individual's count for inferior level were shown to be larger for small sized plots, whereas the spatially structured component increased as the plot size increased. Individual's count showed a higher continuity at close distances than species number in the superior level (> 1.3 m), and the reverse was true for the inferior level (< 0.5 m). Usefulness of kriging maps for comparing patterns of spatial variation between the two studied natural mosaics has been illustrated.

TI  - Long-term change of ant community structure in cacao agroforestry landscapes in Indonesia
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change and agricultural intensification can strongly affect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Although many studies investigate management impacts, data on the long-term change of species communities in agroecosystems are scarce. We analysed the long-term change in diversity and composition of ant communities in cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia and attempted to disentangle the driving factors of this change. Ant communities were resampled in 2009 from sites for which previous surveys had been conducted either in 2001 (the rainforest-poor Palolo region) or 2003 (the rainforest-rich Kulawi region) using insecticide fogging. Ant community composition changed significantly over time in Palolo and Kulawi. The change in ant species richness differed between regions. Species richness increased in Kulawi, probably due to the increasing availability of nest sites and microhabitats as trees grow larger and older. In the Palolo region, species richness decreased, suggesting that the high local intensification and landscape-wide changes may have counteracted the effects of tree age. Changes in ant communities over time were significant, but were more difficult to explain than expected, despite clear difference in management changes within and between regions. The findings suggest that the landscape-scale differences between the two study regions play a more important role for species diversity and its composition than changes in local management. This highlights the importance of long-term studies across contrasting landscapes for better understanding the consequences land-use intensification has on tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Forest use and vertical stratification in fruit-feeding butterflies of Sulawesi, Indonesia:: impacts for conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Protected forest areas of Sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland, especially in lowland and sub-montane regions. Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification. This study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness, and indicates that the contribution of land-use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution, even when relatively high species richness estimates are found.

TI  - Drone-based photogrammetry-derived crown metrics for predicting tree and oil palm water use
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transpiration at the stand level is often estimated from water use measurements on a limited number of plants and then scaled up by predicting the remaining plants of a stand by plant size-related variables. Today, drone-based methods offer new opportunities for plant size assessments. We tested crown variables derived from drone-based photogrammetry for predicting and scaling plant water use. In an oil palm agroforest and an oil palm monoculture plantation in lowland Sumatra, Indonesia, tree and oil palm water use rates were measured by sap flux techniques. Simultaneously, aerial images were taken from an octocopter equipped with an Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We used the structure from motion approach to compute several crown variables such as crown length, width, and volume. Crown volumes for both palms (69%) and trees (81%) explained much of the observed spatial variability in water use; however, the specific crown volume model differed between palms and trees and there was no single linear model fitting for both. Among the trees, crown volume explained more of the observed variability than stem diameter, and in consequence, uncertainties in stand level estimates resulting from scaling were largely reduced. For oil palms, an appropriate whole-plant size-related predictor variable was thus far not available. Stand level transpiration estimates in the studied oil palm agroforest were lower than those in the oil palm monoculture, which is probably due to the small-statured trees. In conclusion, we consider drone-derived crown metrics very useful for the scaling from single plant water use to stand-level transpiration.

TI  - Agroecological Transition of Conilon Coffee (Coffea canephora) Agroforestry Systems in the State of Esp rito Santo, Brazil
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee is a very important product in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, and most of it is planted as unshaded coffee monocultures, with few growers managing shaded coffee agroforestry systems (AFS). To analyze the opportunities and challenges associated with coffee agroforestry management, we conducted 58 semistructured interviews with coffee growers. In addition, we conducted a field investigation that tested production of Coffea canephora with the shade trees Australian Cedar (Toona ciliata), Jequitiba (Cariniana legalis), and Teak (Tectona grandis). Of the 58 interviewed farmers, 64% (37) were satisfied with the AFS. One of the main factors that caused satisfaction was obtaining income from sources other than coffee. Unsatisfied farmers mentioned the competition between shade trees and coffee shrubs. Cedar was the shade tree that grew most and reduced coffee production, while the combination with Jequitiba maintained more stable yields. We conclude that the higher the growth rate of trees, the higher the negative impact on the coffee production in the study areas.

TI  - Shifts in taxonomic and functional microbial diversity with agriculture: How fragile is the Brazilian Cerrado?
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Cerrado-an edaphic type of savannah-comprises the second largest biome of the Brazilian territory and is the main area for grain production in the country, but information about the impact of land conversion to agriculture on microbial diversity is still scarce. We used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare undisturbed (native) soil and soils cropped for 23 years with soybean/maize under conservation tillage-"no-till" (NT)-and conventional tillage (CT) systems in the Cerrado biome.Results: Soil management and fertilizer inputs with the introduction of agriculture improved chemical properties, but decreased soil macroporosity and microbial biomass of carbon and nitrogen. Principal coordinates analyses confirmed different taxonomic and functional profiles for each treatment. There was predominance of the Bacteria domain, especially the phylum Proteobacteria, with higher numbers of sequences in the NT and CT treatments; Archaea and Viruses also had lower numbers of sequences in the undisturbed soil. Within the Alphaproteobacteria, there was dominance of Rhizobiales and of the genus Bradyrhizobium in the NT and CT systems, attributed to massive inoculation of soybean, and also of Burkholderiales. In contrast, Rhizobium, Azospirillum, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas and Acidobacterium predominated in the native Cerrado. More Eukaryota, especially of the phylum Ascomycota were detected in the NT. The functional analysis revealed lower numbers of sequences in the five dominant categories for the CT system, whereas the undisturbed Cerrado presented higher abundance.Conclusion: High impact of agriculture in taxonomic and functional microbial diversity in the biome Cerrado was confirmed. Functional diversity was not necessarily associated with taxonomic diversity, as the less conservationist treatment (CT) presented increased taxonomic sequences and reduced functional profiles, indicating a strategy to try to maintain soil functioning by favoring taxa that are probably not the most efficient for some functions. Our results highlight that underneath the rustic appearance of the Cerrado vegetation there is a fragile soil microbial community.

TI  - Legume silvopastoral systems enhance soil organic matter quality in a subhumid tropical environment
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The silvopastoral system avoids the degradation of tropical grasslands by providing essential nutrients to the soil while improving livestock diet and farmer's income by increasing the marketable wood supply. We hypothesize that intercropping shrub-tree legumes into signalgrass increases microbial activity and soil organic matter (SOM) quality. We investigated silvopastoral system soils over 5 yr in a subhumid climate in northeastern Brazil to determine the total C and N contents and to estimate C-microbial biomass and respiration, microbial and metabolic quotients, humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (FA). The experimental design evaluated (a) signalgrass intercropped with gliricidia at 0, 4, and 8 m from the center of the double legume row; (b) signalgrass intercropped with sabia at 0, 4, and 8 m from the center of the double legume row; and (c) single signalgrass. Samples were obtained after 2, 3, 4, and 5 yr from silvopastoral system implementation. The shrub-tree legumes soils had total C (39 g kg(-1)) and total N (3.8 g kg(-1)) contents significantly higher (30 and 72%, respectively) than single signalgrass soil only on the fifth year after establishment. Microbial biomass C at 0 and 4 m from the legume's rows was 700 mg kg(-1), which was 75% higher than single signalgrass soils. There was strong microbial respiration (similar to 50 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) d(-1)) in legumes soils, but the metabolic quotient did not indicate disturbance in microbial activity. The microbial quotients were significantly higher in shrub-tree legumes soil, and the HA/FA ratio was nearly 1, demonstrating greater efficiency in SOM decomposition by microbial activity. Overall, 5 yr after establishment, the silvopastoral system has improved SOM quality and contributed to grassland sustainability.

TI  - Forest cover change and its carbon dynamic of the karst area in Bulusaraung, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on land forest cover changes and carbon stocks in karst areas is vital for management planning. Therefore, an analysis of the dynamics of land forest cover, carbon stocks of secondary karst forests, and their future projections is necessary. This study aimed to analyze the carbon stocks of secondary forests, forest cover change, and their projections in karst areas. We used 43 sample plots of 20 m x 20 m to measure Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon stocks. Forest cover data were collected using remote sensing and GIS tools. Data analysis of the ABG of the secondary forest for the karst plain and karst tower was conducted using the Chave equation. Land-cover change was analyzed by delineating the 2011, 2016, and 2021 land-cover data from satellite imagery and testing the accuracy using survey data fields and high-resolution images. Land-cover projections for 2026 and 2031 were obtained using Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) analysis. The results revealed ten land cover types in the karst area of the Bulusaraung Forest Management Unit (FMU). Secondary dryland karst forests (tower and plain karst) were the dominant forest types (60%) in the Maros-Pangkep essential karst ecosystem area. Both karst types of secondary forests are relatively high carbon stores. Data projection shows that the mining area will grow extensively by 2031. Secondary dryland karst forests will be degraded by 15.5% in 20 years due to increased mining activities, conversion to paddy fields, dryland agriculture, and mixed dryland agriculture. Karst ecosystems are vital for carbon and water storage. Therefore, some strategies are required for the sustainable management of Maros-Pangkep Karst are as follows: (i) controlling the opening of mining areas according to sustainable environmental principles, (ii) encouraging the implementation of post-mining land rehabilitation, (iii) increasing public awareness of the importance of preserving karst areas, and (iv) implementing soil conservation rules by prioritizing agroforestry systems in dryland farming.

TI  - Edaphic fauna affects soybean productivity under no-till system
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of edaphic fauna under a no-tillage system with different levels of soybean productivity [High (NTH), Medium (NTM) and Low (NTL)] in the west of Santa Catarina (Brazil), identifying which chemical and physical variables most affect them, and the best indicators that can be used. Native forest (NF) areas were used as a reference. A total of 207 samples of soil fauna were collected by soil monolith and pitfall trap methods over two years of evaluation in four municipalities. Based on edaphic fauna data, Shannon-Wiener (H'), Pielou (J), Dominance (D), Margalef and Fisher Alpha (alpha) indices were generated, in addition to the average richness and abundance. Data from NTs were submitted to analysis of variance and compared by Tukey's test (p > 0.05). The NF was used as a reference and compared with the agriculture system by Dunnett test (p > 0.05), and regressions between soybean productivity and diversity indices. The H', Margalef, alpha indices, and average richness for soil fauna sampled by soil monoliths followed the productivity gradient NTH > NTM > NTL, showing a positive correlation with the increase of soybean productivity. NTH has a diversity index similar to that of NF. Soybean productivity is affected by the richness and diversity of edaphic fauna, but abundance was not sensitive in predicting treatments under no-tillage; Fisher's alpha index was more sensitive in treatment separation with soil monoliths. The environmental variables aluminum, organic matter, phosphorus, potassium and penetration resistance affect the fauna edaphic.

TI  - Microbial biomass and activity at various soil depths in a Brazilian oxisol after two decades of no-tillage and conventional tillage
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The advantages of no-tillage (NT) over conventional tillage (CT) systems in improving soil quality are generally accepted, resulting from benefits in soil physical, chemical and biological properties. However, most evaluations have only considered surface soil layers (maximum 0-30 cm depth), and values have not been corrected to account for changes in soil bulk density. The objective of this study was to estimate a more realistic contribution of the NT to soil fertility, by evaluating C- and N-related soil parameters at the 0-60 cm depth in a 20-year experiment established on an oxisol in southern Brazil, with a soybean (summer)/wheat (winter) crop succession under NT and CT. At full flowering of the soybean crop, soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60 cm. For the overall 0-60 cm layer, correcting the values for soil bulk density, NT significantly increased the stocks of C (18%) and N (16%) and microbial biomass C (35%) and N (23%) (MB-C and -N) in comparison to CT. Microbial basal respiration and microbial quotient (qMic) were also significantly increased under NT. When compared with CT. NT resulted in gains of 0.8 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (67% of which was in the 0-30 cm layer) and 70 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (73% in the 0-30 cm layer). In the 0-5-cm layer, MB-C was 82% higher with NT than with CT; in addition, the 0-30 cm layer accumulated 70% of the MB-C with NT, and 58% with CT. In comparison to CT, the NT system resulted in total inputs of microbial C and N estimated at 38 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Apparently, N was the key nutrient limiting C and N stocks, and since adoption of NT resulted in a significant increase of N in soils which were deficient in N, efforts should be focused on increasing N inputs on NT systems.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of the no-tillage system on soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and carbon stocks in Plinthic subgroups and Oxisols, located in Pontes and Lacerda, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The treatments were native vegetation and no-tillage systems established for 3, 8, 10, and 12 years. To analyse soil organic carbon, soils were sampled in each area, with three repetitions, at layers of 0-0.05; 0.05-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60-1.00; 1.00-1.50 and 1.50-2.00 m. For soil bulk density, undisturbed samples were collected at layers of 0-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m. Compared with areas of native vegetation, soil bulk density values after 12 years increased by 25% in Oxisols and 30% in the Plinthic subgroups. In Oxisols and Plinthic subgroups, respectively, organic carbon concentration was, on average, 20.57, 25.04 g kg-1 under native vegetation; 16.82, 16.59 g kg-1 after 3 years of no-tillage; 13.31, 4.96 g kg-1 after 8 years; 16.52, 14.39 g kg-1 after 10 years; and 17.97, 18.53 g kg-1 after 12 years. In both soils, the no-tillage system contributed to an increase in carbon stocks over the years, but not at depth, being generally limited to the top 0.20 m of the soils. Compared to native vegetation, after 12 years of no-tillage, carbon stocks decreased at a rate of 0.075 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the Plinthic subgroups and increased by 2.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 in Oxisols.: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of the no-tillage system on soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and carbon stocks in Plinthic subgroups and Oxisols, located in Pontes and Lacerda, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil.

TI  - Carbon stocks of a degraded soil recovered with agroforestry systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of agroforestry systems (AFS) for the recovery of degraded lands allows the diversification of biomass production and can increase the ecological, economic and social resilience of the restored areas. We evaluated a degraded soil 5 years after the establishment of three AFS with different managements using the carbon stored in the soil and tree biomass as quality indicators. In the AFS we used 33 species. Thirty were native trees interspersed with three cropped species: Hevea brasiliensis, Malpighia glabra L. and Bixa orellana. The AFS treatments were: AFS1 (Mower, trees planted in hollows, spacing 3 m x 2 m, 300 g hollow(-1) of limestone + 36 g hollow(-1) of P2O5, no plantation between rows); AFS2 (Herbicide, trees in hollows, 3.5 x 2 m, maize (Zea mays) between lines, 2 Mg ha(-1) of limestone + 2 Mg ha(-1) of filter cake + 300 kg ha(-1) of NPK 8-28-16); AFS3 (Plough, harrow, scarifier, trees in furrows, 3.5 x 2 m, maize between lines, fertilization similar to the AFS2). As reference, we used a soil under a forest fragment nearby the main experiment. In 5 years, there was an increase of 10 Mg ha(-1) of the soil C stocks under the AFS, which represents an average accumulation rate of 2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The carbon stocks in the biomass in AFS were lower than in the forest. The different management practices used in the implementation of the AFS do not directly affect the total carbon stocks in the 0-100 cm soil layer.

TI  - C and N stocks and maize yield under tillage systems and nitrogen fertilization at Red Yellow Latosol in the savanna of the Piaui State
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Total soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and crop yield are influenced by tillage, biomass input from crop and nitrogen fertilization. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of different tillage systems associated to nitrogen doses on corn yield and C and N stocks in the Red Yellow Latosol in savanna of Piaui state, Brazil. The experiment was carried out in Baixa Grande do Ribeiro, south of Piaui state. The treatments were distributed in a randomized complete blocks and factor arrange 2x5, two tillage systems (no-tillage (NT) and conventional (CT)) and five nitrogen doses (0, 60, 120,180 and 240kg ha(-1) N), respectively, with six replications. The corn grain yield (GY) and C and N inputs were measured and C and N soil stocks were evaluated in the 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-40cm. N doses caused a quadratic response in the grain yield, C and N inputs from maize crop and soil C stocks in both tillage systems. Higher GY were obtained by 138 and 134kg N ha(-1) to CT and NT, respectively. Higher C and N inputs were obtained by 140 and 175kg N ha(-1), in the CT and by 139 and 100kg N ha(-1) in the NT system, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization increased soil C stocks in the NT comparing to CT in the 0-5 and 5-10 depths. No tillage adoption combined with balanced nitrogen fertilization can be important to soil organic matter production in soils under cerrado of Piaui state.

TI  - Soil organic carbon fractions in agroforestry system in Brazil: seasonality and short-term dynamic assessment
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Adopting land-uses that contribute with a considerable litter input can affect the accumulation, protection, and bioavailability of organic carbon in the edaphic environment, compromising the different compartments of soil organic matter (SOM) and the associated benefits. Moreover, changes in seasons can influence the dynamic of SOM. Notably, the mechanisms involved in SOM stabilization and storage, particularly in agroforestry production areas, are still poorly explored. This study aimed to verify if the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the physical fractions of the SOM are modified as a function of agroforestry systems implemented in the short term, and verify if seasonality can affect the compartmentalization of SOM in agrifood systems. Also, we tested if the carbon management index (CMI) is sensitive to detecting management practices quality across the unmanaged pasture, different agroforestry systems, and a reference area (forest). We measured soil physical properties, SOC content in bulk soil, particular organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) fractions at three different depths (0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m) in response to the adoption of agroforestry systems. Our results show that after a short period of implementation of agroforestry systems, significant changes were observed in SOC contents and the physical fractions of SOM in the most superficial layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m), with emphasis on the particulate fraction of SOM. We verified that the seasonality affected the SOC, POC, and MAOC contents. We also found that the CMI index was more sensitive and efficient in detecting changes arising from seasonality and the management practices involved. According to this index, it was possible to verify that the agroforestry system with the highest density of species for biomass production (AS3) has been accumulating more carbon in the soil. Therefore, this study provides relevant information regarding soil carbon management in agroforestry systems.

TI  - Does irrigated mango cultivation alter organic carbon stocks under fragile soils in semiarid climate?
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sub-middle Sao Francisco Valley is a center of intense activity of irrigated fruit fanning, which may lead to alterations in soil attributes and processes compared with areas under native vegetation, in this case Caatinga. One of the attributes sensitive to such alterations is soil organic matter (SOM), considering the climatic semi-arid conditions, fragile soils (sandy soils) and the adopted management such as the organic residues deposition from pruning, goat manure fertilization, high availability of water, and nutrients. Thus, in order to evaluate the influence of irrigated mango cultivation on the C stocks of the SOM fractions in a Neossolo Quartzarenico in Petrolina - PE, Brazil, in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015), soil samples were collected in the 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m layers in areas under irrigated mango (planting row and interrow) and Caatinga (taken as reference). The following variables were determined: contents of total organic carbon (TOC); carbon associated with humic substances - HS (fulvic acid fraction - FAF, filmic acid fraction - HAF and humin fraction - HF); carbon associated with light fraction (Ltf) and heavy fraction (HvF); and labile C (LC). Samples were collected to determine soil density, and the stocks of TOC and C associated with SOM fractions were calculated. Irrigated mango cultivation (soils collected in the row) led to higher stocks of TOC, C of HF and HS, compared with the Caatinga in both years evaluated. Irrigated mango cultivation (soils collected in the row) also resulted in increase in the stock of C in Ltf in the 0-0.1 m layer in 2014. In the second year of evaluation, irrigated mango cultivation (soils collected in the row) caused increments of 26.09 and 35.29% in the TOC of the 0-0.1 and 0.1-0.2 m layers, respectively. There were no differences in the C of HS in the soil along the row of irrigated mango trees in the 00.1 and 0.1-0.2 m layers between 2014 and 2015. On the other hand, for soils of the interrow of irrigated mango, the C stocks of HS, HF and HvF were lower in 2015 than in 2014. In the semiarid climate and fragile soils, the increase in C stocks of SOM fractions is more limited to the row of irrigated mango, compared with the Caatinga.

TI  - Humic extracts from hydrochar and Amazonian Anthrosol: Molecular features and metal binding properties using EEM-PARAFAC and 2D FTIR correlation analyses
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter plays many roles in the soil ecosystem. One property of the substance concerns the metal complexation and interaction with organic contaminants. In this sense, the humic substances (HS), a heterogeneous mixture of compounds, naturally derived from degradation of biomass, have been widely studied in environmental sciences. Recent advances showed a new way to produce humic-like substances (HLS) through hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the HLS of hydrochars, produced by using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and vinasse with sulfuric acid added (1 and 4% v/v), and to assess their interactions with metal ions, (Fe(III), Al(III), Cu(II) and Co(II)) using EEM-PARAFAC and a two-dimensional FTIR correlation analysis. The results were compared to the humic substances extracted from the Amazonian Anthrosol, as a model of anthropogenic organic matter. NMR analysis showed that humic-like extracts from hydrochar are mainly hydrophobic, while the soil has a greater contribution of polar moieties. The HLS and HS showed similar complexation capacities for Fe(III), Al(III) and Cu(II) assays. For Co(II) HLS exhibited larger affinities than HS. Two-dimensional correlation analysis FTIR showed that chemical groups may undergo conformational alteration with metal additions to achieve more stable arrangements (higher stability constant). Therefore, these results contribute more knowledge about the mechanism of HS and metal ion interaction, as well as showing that HTC can be an interesting option for HLS production, to be used as humic based materials.

TI  - Native multispecies and fast-growing forest root biomass increase C and N stocks in a reclaimed bauxite mining area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed at evaluating C and N stocks in fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in an area of bauxite mining under recovery with tree species. We have analyzed the long-term recovery of C and N stocks of organic matter fractions from five types of forest cover (Eucalyptus, Anadenanthera peregrina, mixed plantation of 16 native species, a mined area without vegetation cover as a control site, and a natural forest cover as a reference site). The total organic C (TOC) and N (TN) stocks and also organic matter fractions, particulate organic matter (POM), mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), microbial biomass (MB), and labile C (LC), were determined, as well as the C/N ratio and the carbon management index (CMI). Although the stocks of TOC and LC, CMI, and MB did not differ between the types of forest cover in the 0-60 cm layer, they were lower than the values in the native forest. Forest cover increases the stocks of TOC, LC, MB, and CMI in the area of bauxite mining compared to the control site. In addition, we found that the TOC C and TN stocks and also SOM fractions (LC, C-MAOM, C-POM, N-MAOM, and N-POM) are positively correlated (r >= 0.71 for all cases) with volume of roots larger than 2 mm. Therefore, Eucalyptus, A. peregrina, and a mixed of 16 native trees contribute for restoring stocks of soil C and N following bauxite mining in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Uncertainty in below-ground carbon biomass for major land covers in Southeast Asia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Owing to difficulties associated with measuring root biomass accurately in space and time, below-ground root biomass is often calculated indirectly from above-ground biomass measurements via general allometric equations. Of concern is that general equations may not provide accurate site-specific calculations for accurate carbon stock assessments. This review comparing more than 100 root-related studies conducted in SE Asia shows highly variable and uncertain below-ground woody carbon (BGC) biomass estimates for many vegetation types associated with on-going land-use changes throughout the region. Most BGC data exist for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; only a few studies have been conducted for Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Timor Leste and Vietnam. While substantial data exist for a variety of forests and timber-plantations, little work has focused on key transition land-covers including rubber, oil palm, swidden fallows, agroforests, grasslands, and croplands. Mangroves (12-219 Mg C ha(-1)), peat forests (11-71 Mg C ha(-1)) and other forest types (11-74 Mg C ha(-1)) have the highest BGC values. The limited data for rubber plantations (5-32 Mg C ha(-1)), oil palm plantations (4-22 Mg C ha(-1)), swidden fallows (3-16 Mg C ha(-1)), and non-swidden agroforestry (316 Mg C ha(-1)) indicate modest differences in the amount of BGC for several land covers that are at the heart of ongoing debates regarding the human and environmental impacts of agricultural intensification. The paucity of data currently in existence for the region highlights the need for additional field investigations following accepted protocols of root biomass to facilitate efforts to improve carbon stock estimates. Government agencies, private enterprises, and development agencies could help lead the way in developing a better forest carbon database by teaming with researchers to assess total ecosystem carbon stocks prior to vegetation being removed for construction, mining, or stand rotations.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities associated with coffee intercropped with grevillea
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in coffee-cultivated areas in the northeastern region of Brazil have been insufficiently studied when compared to other Brazilian regions. This study determined AMF occurrence and richness in coffee-cultivated soils under different management systems and in soils from surrounding areas with pasture and native forest (control areas), all of them located in the southwest region of Bahia, Brazil. Physicochemical soil characteristics in the different study areas were also evaluated. A total of 43 AMF spore morphotypes in 14 genera belonging to six families were recovered from soil samples from all study areas: Glomeraceae (35%), Acaulosporaceae (35%), Gigasporaceae (21%), Ambisporaceae (5%), Archaeosporaceae (2%) and Diversisporaceae (2%). Rhizophagus fasciculatus, Acaulospora mellea and Glomus sp. 1 were the most frequent fungi found in all areas. In the coffee-cultivated areas, 12 genera were identified, two of which (Dominikia and Fuscutata) had not yet been reported in association with coffee plants in Brazil. We concluded that soil physicochemical properties and AMF occurrence can distinguish study areas based on land use. The different coffee management systems did not influence AMF species richness, but the occurrence was influenced by both management and soil factors.

TI  - The southern Brazilian grassland biome: soil carbon stocks, fluxes of greenhouse gases and some options for mitigation
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Brazilian grassland biome contains highly diverse natural ecosystems that have been used for centuries for grazing livestock and that also provide other important environmental services. Here we outline the main factors controlling ecosystem processes, review and discuss the available data on soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gases emissions from soils, and suggest opportunities for mitigation of climatic change. The research on carbon and greenhouse gases emissions in these ecosystems is recent and the results are still fragmented. The available data indicate that the southern Brazilian natural grassland ecosystems under adequate management contain important stocks of organic carbon in the soil, and therefore their conservation is relevant for the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, these ecosystems show a great and rapid loss of soil organic carbon when converted to crops based on conventional tillage practices. However, in the already converted areas there is potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by using cropping systems based on no soil tillage and cover-crops, and the effect is mainly related to the potential of these crop systems to accumulate soil organic carbon in the soil at rates that surpass the increased soil nitrous oxide emissions. Further modelling with these results associated with geographic information systems could generate regional estimates of carbon balance.

TI  - Ant diversity partitioning across spatial scales: Ecological processes and implications for conserving Tropical Dry Forests
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several ecological and evolutionary processes can drive changes in diversity at different spatial scales. To determine the scale at which these processes are most influential, we hypothesized that (i) broad-scale differences between ecoregions had greater influence on ant species richness and species turnover than local differences among fragments within ecoregions; and (ii) the degree of dissimilarity in ant species composition is larger between Tropical Dry Forest fragments and the surrounding vegetations than among Tropical Dry Forests located in different ecoregions, indicating that extant Tropical Dry Forests are relicts of a broader distribution of this vegetation. To examine ant diversity patterns, we built a nested hierarchical design on three spatial scales, ranging from fragments (local scale), Tropical Dry Forest+surroundings vegetation (landscape scale) and Brazilian ecoregions (regional scale). We used 450 sampling units (45 sampling unitsxtwo fragmentsxfive ecoregions=450). A null model based on the sample was used to identify variations in the random distribution across spatial scales. Spatial partitioning of ant diversity showed that observed (1) diversity (between fragments) and (2) diversity (among ecoregions) were higher than expected by chance. When the partitioning was analysed separately for each region, the observed (1) diversity (Tropical Dry Forest and surrounding vegetation) was higher than expected by the null hypothesis in all ecoregions of Brazil. Based on species composition and diversity patterns, we stress the importance of creating more protected areas throughout the coverage area of Tropical Dry Forests, favouring a more efficient conservation process.

TI  - Conservation and development projects in the Brazilian Amazon: Lessons from the community initiative program in Rondonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailing programmatic paradigm of conservation organizations and development donors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealing for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic development at the local level with the conservation of legally established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed, approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.

TI  - SURVEY OF NON-FLYING MAMMALS IN A SEMI-DECIDUOUS SEASONAL FOREST FRAGMENT AT SÃO FRANCISCO FOREST STATE PARK
T2  - Oecologia Australis
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a highly diverse biome due to its significant geographical variation in latitude, longitude, and altitude. Mammals are particularly susceptible to habitat fragmentation. Surveys of these group in forest fragments essential for conservation efforts. Surveys of non-flying mamals provide critical data on biodiversity, aiding in the protection and management of species and their habitats. To assess the richness of non-flying mammals in the S & atilde;o Francisco Forest Conservation Unit, we used direct observation methods and camera traps. The study began in early 2022 and was concluded in September 2023. We recorded 24 native species and two exotic species. Four species found are vulnerable to extinction: Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Leopardus guttulus, Leopardus wiedii, and Alouatta guariba clamitans. Notably, the most frequently recorded species was the exotic Sus scrofa (37% of records), followed by native species Dicotyles tajacu (18%), Didelphis albiventris, and Nasua nasua (both around 7%). The low richness can be attributed to factors like habitat fragmentation, historical anthropogenic impacts and the size and degree of isolation of the Conservation Unit. These findings include significant new records for the region, such as Dicotyles tajacu, which had not been documented in this fragment previously. However, the high frequency of the invasive species Sus scrofa poses a concerning impact on local biodiversity. This study highlights the fragment's critical importance for maintaining the biodiversity of non-flying mammals in the Atlantic Forest biome.
