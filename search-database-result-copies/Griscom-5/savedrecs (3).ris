TI  - Quantifying market prevalence, abundance, and suitable habitats of bulbuls in Java, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of bulbuls in the Indonesian cage bird trade raises concerns about its impact on their distributions and, consequently, the ecological balance. This study delves into the trade dynamics of bulbuls, examining their market prevalence and its correlation with their abundance in the wild and their suitable habitats. We conducted bird market surveys across Java, supplemented by online trade surveys to ascertain market prevalence. Concurrently, we collected bulbul's presence data from three databases and field surveys from 2018 to 2023. We used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the suitable habitats for bulbuls. The findings revealed that 20 bulbul species, comprising 11 native and 9 non-native to Java, were encountered in 20 bird markets, totalling 35,715 individuals. Sooty-headed (Pycnonotus aurigaster) and yellow-vented (P. goiavier) bulbuls, both Least Concern, dominated the field-RAI (Relative Abundance Index) and trade-RAI. Notably, rare species such as the strawheaded bulbul (P. zeylanicus, Critically Endangered) and extirpated from Java, were present in markets. We found no relationship between the field-RAI and the trade-RAI, suggesting that all species were sought after regardless of their abundance. However, we found that threatened species face over-harvesting based on the ratio between trade-RAI and field-RAI. A significant portion of predicted suitable habitats for resident species fell outside bird-friendly areas. Urgent intervention measures, targeting small-scale agroforestry landowners and key sites for population protection, are imperative to mitigate the potential ecological consequences of the bulbul trade and ensure their continued contribution to tropical ecosystem health.

TI  - Earthworm richness in land-use systems in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article

CP  - 16th International Colloquium on Soil Zoology (ICSZ)
CL  - Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Brazil is a megadiverse country from which around 10% of all species are known. However, many areas in Brazil have not been adequately studied, particularly for soil animals. This includes the state of Santa Catarina, where only 18 of the approximately 300 known Brazilian earthworm species occur, and where very little is known of the impacts of land use management on earthworm populations (density and diversity). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate earthworm species richness in five different land-use systems (LUS) with increasing anthropogenic impact: native forest (NF), eucalyptus plantation( EP), pasture (PA), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and no-tillage cropping (NT), in six counties, three each from the Western and Plateau regions of the state. Nine monoliths of 25 cm x 25 cm x 20 cm depth were sampled at each site and worms hand sorted. Qualitative samples were also taken by digging at least 20 holes per site to improve the likelihood of collecting rare species. Samples were taken in the Winter and Summer months of 2011-2012 (July-August 2011, December 2011-January 2012). Contrary to expectations, species richness was higher in LUS with higher (ICL and NT = 15 and 17 spp.) vs. lower anthropogenic impacts (EP, PA, NF = 9-10 spp.), mainly due to the presence of exotic species in the cropping systems. Native species predominated in PA and NF, although natives were also found in highly disturbed ecosystems (NT, ICL) and in the West region all worms collected in NT were native. In total 24 species were identified in all LUS, with 19 native species, including several that were new to science. Several species were collected exclusively in each region, and overall qualitative samples yielded 24 species while quantitative samples only 16. Therefore, qualitative sampling appears to be more effective in determining earthworm species richness at regional levels, although quantitative samples are a useful addition when LUS are compared within a region, and if abundance and diversity index calculations are needed.

TI  - The diversity of diurnal bird species on western slope of Mount Lawu, Java, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Lawu is one of the highest inactive volcanoes in Java Island, Indonesia. Mount Lawu attracts people to cultivate its area for agriculture, but without proper management, the biodiversity in Mount Lawu is in threat. This research aimed to get information about diurnal bird diversity on the western slope of Mount Lawu which includes a forest area (FA), an agroforestry area (AA), and a residential area (RA). Data collection was performed through point count method in 5 to 6 point per sites within certain time intervals after dawn and before sunset. There were 61 bird species from 26 families with a total number of 1416 birds being observed. The diversity index of the western slope was 2.480, and the highest Hmax among observed areas was the forest area (3.714). Collocalia linchi (Di 37.92) and Pycnonotus aurigaster (Di 19.42) were very common almost in all observation areas. The most similar ecosystem was FA and AA (J 0.176), followed by AA and RA (J 0.24), and FA and RA (J 0.393). A better management of Mount Lawu is necessary to improve human and biodiversity wellness. The result of this study could be used as additional data to consider a stronger protection for the biodiversity in Mount Lawu.

TI  - Soil amendment and N fertilization strategies to improve C sequestration and storage in soil aggregates
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Management can affect soil quality through changes in carbon (C) stock, especially in protected C fractions of soil aggregates. Soil aggregation and C sequestration may be improved with soil correction (liming and gypsum) and nitrogen (N) fertilization, but it is not clear how these factors might interact to affect humic substances. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and N fertilizatilizer amendments on the accumulation of C, N, and humic substances in soil aggregates from an Oxisoil in Brazil. The production system was no-till soybean [Gycine max (L.) Merr] double-cropped with maize (Zea mays L.) and intercropped with forage grass since 2016. Treatments were no amendment, lime only, and lime + phosphogypsum, factorially arranged with and without annual N fertilization of maize. Soil was collected at 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm 6 years after initiation of the experiment. The combination of lime, gypsum, and N led to 13% greater total C stock and 20% greater total N stock within the 0-60 cm soil profile than the control. Levels of fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) were similar among aggregate classes, but humin was greatest in larger aggregates. Liming plus N decreased FA and HA, but gypsum application mitigated this negative effect. Application of limestone, gypsum, and N increased humin, mainly in the soil surface (0-10 cm). Soil C storage and stabilization was enhanced in large soil aggregates with the combined use of lime, gypsum, and N fertilization in humid tropical soils.Combination of lime, gypsum, and nitrogen fertilization increased soil carbon. Larger aggregates were more important for carbon and nitrogen storage. Gypsum prevented fulvic acid decline under liming and nitrogen fertilization. Greater humin concentration was found in larger soil aggregates.

TI  - Back to basics: Considerations in evaluating the outcomes of community forestry
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Evaluations on community forestry outcomes are important to observe whether the program community forestry produces what it has promised. For the evaluation -as an alternative to the comprehensive criteria and indicators on sustainable community forestry-, we propose an approach based on the core policy objectives of the program. In fact, community forestry is very much connected to the following three objectives of: 1) alleviating the poverty of forest users, 2) empowering them, and 3) improving the condition of the forests. Based on field tests in two community forests in Indonesia, the focus on the core policy objectives appears to provide a more practical approach than the use of complex criteria and indicators. We conclude that our approach allows rapid evaluations and eventually reduces the associated costs and time without compromising the goals of the evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The relative importance of forest cover and patch-level drivers for phyllostomid bat communities in the Amazonian Savannas
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Analyze the multiple dimensions of biodiversity under a local and landscape lens in natural habitats, such as Amazonian savannas, is fundamental for the conservation of species and ecosystems.Objectives We aim to explore how landscape forest cover and patch-level variables affect the patterns of species abundance, functional traits, and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic alpha-diversity of Phyllostomid bats in forest patches of the Savannas of Amap & aacute;, in both the wet and dry seasons.Methods We used mist nets to survey bats in 26 forest patches. We also quantified forest cover in buffers of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m around each patch, and tree height, basal area, canopy cover, and vegetation clutter in the understorey at the patch level. We used hierarchical partitioning to relate the different indices with our predictor variables.Results Taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in the wet season increased with the proportion of forest cover in the 2500 m buffer. Vegetation clutter was negatively related to taxonomic and functional diversity in the wet season. In the dry season, average tree height positively affected taxonomic and functional diversity. Patch-level variables were more important than forest cover in explaining the average functional traits in both seasons.Conclusion We found seasonal variation in the relationships between components of bat diversity and different drivers. Since both forest cover in the landscape and patch-level variables are important for Phyllostomid bat diversity, conservation plans should consider forest conservation at the landscape level and maintenance of forest patch quality.

TI  - Students' perception of urban and rural environmental protection areas in Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research assessed the relationship between students' perceptions and socioeconomic factors in urban and rural communities surrounding Atlantic rainforest protection areas in Pernambuco, Brazil. We tested whether the utilitarian concept of forests has a determining role in the student community's perception of protected areas. The study was conducted in eight schools in communities surrounding three protected areas, through questionnaires for 410 middle and High school students. The majority of students highlighted the utilitarian importance of forests, but approximately 60% of students did not answer the question regarding the importance of protected areas, displaying a disconnection between perceptions of forests and of protected areas. The students' environmental perception index was significantly different between rural and urban zones, but in both zones, on average, protected areas had a positive utilitarian importance, exclusively related to the protection of nature. Negative aspects of the students' perceptions of protected areas were related to social problems such as lack of law enforcement and land expropriation. Schooling and residence setting had a small (6.7%) but significant influence on student perception. Our results indicate that environmental managers in protected areas need to promote meaningful interaction with student communities from rural and urban settings, to increase the efficiency of these areas and to conserve biological diversity.

TI  - Agroforestry adoption and maintenance: self-efficacy, attitudes and socio-economic factors
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is a key land use in the development of ecological corridors in tropical rainforests biomes. This research tested the social dimensions of agroforestry adoption and maintenance in the Atlantic rainforest of Southern Bahia, Brazil. A quasi-experiment research design compared a group of farmers who participated in an agroforestry development program with a group of similar farmers who were not participants in the program. The effects of the program on the participants' self-efficacy, attitudes and intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry were tested. The effects of socio-economic factors and attitudes were also compared to self-efficacy in terms of farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Results indicate that the program neither raised nor lowered the farmers' attitudes, self-efficacy or intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. However, multiple regression and logistic model analyses indicate that perceived behavioral control, attitudes about conservation and available labor contributed most significantly to farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Overall, perceived behavioral control proved to have the most significant correlation with farmers' intentions to adopt or maintain agroforestry. Therefore, agroforestry development programs could benefit from focusing on farmers' perceived control of certain behaviors to enhance the persistence of agroforestry practices.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Soil Fauna Under Different Land Use and Managements
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostatistics allows the evaluation of the distribution pattern of data with high spatial variability in agricultural systems. This study aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of biological diversity indices of soil fauna under different land (agriculture and forest). Samples were collected in seven areas (millet, soybean, corn, eucalyptus, pasture crops, and preserved and disturbed Cerrado), in Maranhao state, Brazil. The soil fauna was caught trapped in pitfall traps, installed 3 m away from each other. In each area, 130 traps were maintained for seven days. After this period, they were removed and their content transferred to bottles and taken to the laboratory, where the insects were screened and identified at the level of orders and families. Eight indices were calculated, namely: individuals trap(-1) day(-1), Jackknife richness estimator, the Simpson, McIntosh, Shannon, and total diversity, and Simpson dominance, and Pielou equitability indices. The spatial variability was derived from the semivariograms fitted to Gaussian, spherical, and exponential geostatistical models. Statistical analysis showed medium values of the coefficient of variation for millet, except for the indices individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and McIntosh diversity, which were considered high. The values of the correlation matrix were negative for some indices, suggesting an inverse relationship. For millet, corn, eucalyptus, disturbed Cerrado, and pasture areas, the Shannon diversity index exhibited a pure nugget effect. For the areas of millet, corn, disturbed Cerrado and pasture, the total diversity index was adjusted to the Gaussian model. The degree of spatial dependence was considered high for the individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and Pielou equitability indices for millet. Only for soybean and pasture similarity in the scaled semivariograms was observed for the spatial variability of the indices, indicating similarity of performance. Soil management and land use affect the patterns of soil fauna abundance, richness, and diversity. The presence of groups such as Araneae, Diplura, and Poduromorpha are related to ecological equilibrium, quality, and sustainability of the agricultural systems studied.

TI  - Invertebrate fauna and physical and chemical attributes of soil under integrated crop-livestock systems
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems on the main groups of soil invertebrate macrofauna and the relationship of these organisms with soil physical and chemical attributes. The conventional system, integrated crop-livestock system, no-tillage system, continuously cultivated pasture, and natural fragments of Cerrado and of semi-deciduous forest were compared. The experiment was carried out in Dourados, MS, Brazil, on a Typic Hapludox soil, divided into strips. The highest density, richness, and diversity of families were found in the ICL system, under no-tillage, and in the continuously cultivated pasture. The conventional system caused greater reduction of the soil invertebrate community. The ICL system favors the maintenance of the invertebrate fauna diversity, the formation of stable aggregates, and soil fertility. The Sthaphylinidae family is a potential soil quality bioindicator, especially in the semi-deciduous forest and in the ICL system.

TI  - State of the Art of Phytoremediation in Brazil-Review and Perspectives
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The pollution of terrestrial and aquatic environments with heavy metals is a serious concern on a worldwide scale. Trace elements can be highly toxic and carcinogenic for human health while also detrimental to animal and plant life of ecosystems surrounding contamination hotspots. Phytoremediation is a low-cost and environment-friendly plant-based technique to alleviate polluted areas, which constitutes a viable alternative to other complex, costly, and often harmful traditional methods. Phytoremediation is particularly interesting for Brazil, given the country's rich biodiversity and climate. This mini-review covers some of the most important results in phytoremediation studies carried out in Brazil to date, with a particular focus on the potential of the Brazilian flora for phytostabilization and phytoextraction, the two main subcategories of phytoremediation. Moreover, it includes data from two previously unpublished trials about phytoremediation of metal-polluted soil and water with vetiver grass and four wetland macrophytes (water hyacinth, creeping river grass, alligator weed, and water lettuce).

TI  - Earthworm species in Musa spp. plantations in Brazil and worldwide
T2  - ZOOKEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bananas and plantains are major commodity/food crops that represent an important habitat for earthworms, although so far, no review is available on earthworm communities associated with banana/plantain crops worldwide. The Vale do Ribeira region is among the largest banana producing areas in Brazil, but little is known of the earthworms living there. Hence, the present study assessed earthworm populations and species in three banana plantations and adjacent Atlantic forest fragments along the Ribeira de Iguape River using standard (hand sorting) methodologies. Furthermore, we review earthworm populations reported in banana/plantain plantations worldwide. Only two species (Pontoscolex corethrurus, Amynthas gracilis) belonging to two families (Rhinodrilidae, Megascolecidae) were found in the Ribeira River valley, occurring concurrently. Abundance was low (< 13 indiv. m(-2)) compared with other banana plantations worldwide, that frequently surpassed 100 indiv. m(-2). More than 70 studies reported earthworms from >200 banana plantations in 28 countries, and mean species richness was 2.7 per site, ranging from 1 to 10 species. Exotics predominated in most sites and P. corethrurus was the most prevalent species encountered. Overall, more than 104 species from 10 families were reported, with around 61 native and 43 exotic widespread species, mainly of the Megascolecidae, Lumbricidae and Acanthodrilidae families. Richness was highest in India (27 spp.) and the Canary Islands (25 spp.), but native species dominated only in a few countries and sites, while exotics were prevalent especially in island countries and Brazil. Lower-input practices appear to be important for earthworm communities and banana plantations can have large earthworm populations in some cases, which may be contributing to soil processes and plant production, topics that deserve further attention. However, many important banana-producing countries have not yet been evaluated, so further work is warranted, both in terms of applied ecology and biodiversity.

TI  - Landscape forest cover and local vegetation structure mediate multitrophic relationships but not the leaf damage in cacao trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao is the most important agricultural product in the southern region of Bahia state, Brazil, with 70 % of its production occurring under the traditional agroforestry where cacao is mostly shaded by native trees. This traditional system allows to reconcile the production with the maintenance of the portion of original biodiversity. However, increased deforestation and intensified agroforestry management aimed at boosting productivity may impact the diversity of native species and the services they provide. In this context, our aim was to disentangle the role of landscape forest cover and the local vegetation complexity on predation of caterpillars and herbivory of cacao plants located in agroforestry systems. The study was conducted across 18 cacao agroforest sites in southern Bahia located in landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. We assessed predation rate using dummy caterpillars, sampling understory birds and arthropods and collected leaves of cacao trees to analyze damage by herbivory. We also measured shading levels and the abundance of cacao trees in each agroforestry. Predation pressure on dummy caterpillars was positively influenced by the abundance of total predators and the level of landscape forest cover and negatively by the number of cacao trees. Even so, we found no evidence that landscape, local features or the actual invertebrate assemblages (predators or herbivores) influenced the cacao leaf damage. The findings highlight the multifaceted interactions between ecological factors, predation pressure, and leaf damage within cacao agroforestry systems.

TI  - Diversity and spatial distribution of predacious Dolichopodidae (Insecta: Diptera) on organic vegetable fields and adjacent habitats in Brazil
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Adults of the fly family Dolichopodidae (Diptera) are general predators on small soft-bodied invertebrates, and often are abundant in agroecosystems. However, information about their diversity and spatial distribution in agricultural landscapes are scarce. Using structured sampling, we identified the species of Dolichopodidae associated with organic vegetable crops, fallow, agroforestry, and native vegetation in the Federal District of Brazil, and evaluate their richness and abundance. We collected 70 species Dolichopodidae distributed in 17 genera and 9 subfamilies. Of these, some 80% of the specimens belong to the following 5 taxa: Chrysotus spectabilis (Loew), Thrypticus violaceous Van Duzee, Condylostylus depressus (Aldrich), Condylostylus "caudatus group" females, and Condylostylus erectus Becker (all Diptera: Dolichopodidae). Habitats with vegetable crops harbored a higher abundance and number of species (diversity a), with a gradual reduction towards more forested environments of native vegetation. This is an inverse gradient with the general patterns of community studies with other taxa. We also verified the importance of less disturbed habitats over time in the agricultural landscape, such as agroforestry and native vegetation, as complementary habitats for the maintenance and conservation of dolichopodid species in particular, a scenario to be tested for other insect groups.

TI  - Neotropical small mammals' diversity in the early cycle of commercial Eucalyptus plantations
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies carried out in Brazil revealed that Eucalyptus plantations shelter numerous species of small-size non-flying mammals. However, their distribution pattern inside the Eucalyptus plantations remains unknown. This study aimed at the identification of possible influence of distances from the remaining native revegetation areas and riparian systems, on spatial distribution and abundance of small-size mammals in Eucalyptus plantations. This study was carried at Eucalyptus stands recently planted (0-3 years) at the municipality of Angatuba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil between August 2007 and July 2009. The survey was carried out using pitfall traps at 14 sampling units inside Eucalyptus plantations 60-1130 m away from the borders. With a sampling effort of 2,449 bucket night, the experiment captured 680 individuals belonging to 12 species of small-size mammals (rodents and marsupials). The colonization process of Eucalyptus plantations was apparently initiated by generalist species from open Cerrado. In the present study, we did not find any clear correlation between specific richness and abundance of individuals and the distance from native revegetation areas or closer riparian systems. The study suggests that Eucalyptus plantations are permeable matrices to, at least, more generalist species present in the silvicultural landscapes (i.e. composed by an Eucalyptus plantation as the matrix and native vegetation patches). However, further studies must prioritize analyzing the influence of agricultural/sivilcultural practices (e.g., plantation structure and harvest frequency) on habitat quality and carrying capacity of agricultural/silvicultural landscape matrices, as well as implementing long-term monitoring programs to assess the impact of complete production cycles (some years) and along cycles of Eucalyptus plantations (some decades), on rodents population's diversity and dynamics patterns.

TI  - Soil macrofauna under integrated crop-livestock systems in a Brazilian Cerrado Ferralsol
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the effects of integrated crop-livestock systems, associated with two tillage and two fertilization regimes, on the abundance and diversity of the soil macrofauna. Four different management systems were studied: continuous pasture (mixed grass); continuous crop; two crop-livestock rotations (crop/pasture and pasture/crop); and native Cerrado as a control. Macrofauna was sampled using a modified Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility method, and all individuals were counted and identified at the morphospecies level for each plot. A total of 194 morphospecies were found, distributed among 30 groups, and the most representative in decreasing order of density were: Isoptera, Coleoptera larvae, Formicidae, Oligochaeta, Coleoptera adult, Diplopoda, Hemiptera, Diptera larvae, Arachnida, Chilopoda, Lepidoptera, Gasteropoda, Blattodea and Orthoptera. Soil management systems and tillage regimes affected the structure of soil macrofauna, and integrated crop-livestock systems, associated with no-tillage, especially with grass/legume species associations, had more favorable conditions for the development of "soil engineers" compared with continuous pasture or arable crops. Soil macrofauna density and diversity, assessed at morphospecies level, are effective data to measure the impact of land use in Cerrado soils.

TI  - Soil macrofauna correlations with soil chemical and physical properties and crop sequences under no-tillage
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil macrofauna is an important indicator of soil quality, as it is sensitive to changes in the environment as a result of soil management, which includes soil chemical and physical properties and the diversity of cultivated species. This study aimed to evaluate the composition and structure of soil macrofauna under a no-tillage system in different crop sequences, with and without crop rotation, over two growing seasons: a rainy summer and a dry winter. The crop sequences were soybean/corn rotation in the summer and corn in the winter; soybean/corn rotation in the summer and sunn hemp in the winter; soybean monoculture in the summer and sunn hemp in the winter; and corn monoculture in the summer and corn monoculture in the winter growing season. The nutrient content of the crop residues left on the soil surface, soil chemical and physical properties, and soil macrofauna were determined. Functional plant groups (grasses or legumes) individually influenced the composition of soil macrofauna more significantly than the effect of crop sequence, with or without rotation, and growing season. Grasses favored an increased density of groups such as Oligochaeta, Isoptera, and Formicidae. In contrast, legumes contributed to the variation in the total density of individuals and Diplura and Coleoptera groups. Furthermore, the influence of functional plant groups (grasses or legumes) on the composition and density of soil macrofauna were related to soil chemical (P and N content) and physical properties (particulate organic carbon and soil moisture), which determined the composition of soil macrofauna groups.

AB  - Knowledge of the variation of potential carbon stocks in different types of forests provides information about the capabilities of each forest type in dealing with climate change mitigation. This research was conducted to determine the dynamics of carbon stocks in gofasa plantation community forests and compared to other land use systems in South Sulawesi. The research used sample plots 20 m x 50 m to measure tree biomass and 1 m x 1 m sub plots for undergrowth and litter. The results of the study indicated that there were variations of potential carbon stocks in plantation community forests and agroforestry. Carbon stocks in plantation community forest were varied according to the condition and age of forest stand. The total aboveground carbon stocks in homogenous gofasa stand ranged from 22.34 to 52.65 ton/ha by the difference in stand ages, while in mixed community forest was 77.60 ton/ha. As for agroforestry system, the carbon stocks ranged from 46.40 to 65.89 ton/ha. The dynamics of variations in carbon stocks in plantation community forest and agroforestry were determined by several variables such as species composition, stand age, and stand density. Therefore, a good management of community forests and agroforestry systems will ensure the mitigation of climate changes and environmental preservation through effective carbon storage.

T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of rhizobia in agricultural soils planted with soybean (Glycine max L.) and managed under conventional or no-tillage practices was evaluated by using a combination of trap-host capture and DNA fingerprinting approaches. Fifty-eight rhizobia isolates were captured using pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) as a trap-host and characterised by using the RAPD DNA fingerprinting technique, yielding 25 different RAPD profiles. The application of the Shannon-Weaver diversity index demonstrated that the diversity of rhizobia was significantly reduced in soil samples from plots cultivated with soybean compared with original uncultivated pasture plots.

TI  - Vertical distribution of epiphytic bryophytes in an Indonesian rainforest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied species richness, composition and vertical distribution of epiphytic bryophytes in submontane rainforest of Central Sulawesi. Bryophytes were sampled on eight canopy trees and on eight trees in the forest understorey. Microclimate was measured at trunk bases and at crown bases. The total recorded number of 146 epiphytic bryophyte species is among the highest ever reported for tropical forests and underlines the importance of the Malesian region as a global biodiversity hotspot. Species composition differed significantly between understorey trees and canopy tree trunks on the one hand, and the forest canopy on the other. Fourty-five percent of the bryophyte species were restricted to canopy tree crowns, 12% to the understorey. Dendroid and fan-like species mainly occurred in the forest understorey whereas tufts were most species rich in the tree crowns. The findings reflect the different microclimatic regimes and substrates found in the understorey and in the forest canopy. The results indicate that assessments of the bryophyte diversity of tropical forests are inadequate when understorey trees and tree crowns are excluded.

TI  - Can Joint Carbon and Biodiversity Management in Tropical Agroforestry Landscapes Be Optimized?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a potential 'win-win' scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We measured above-and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of plants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural rainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural forests with carbon stocks of 227-362 Mg C ha(-1) to agroforests with 82-211 Mg C ha(-1) showed no relationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species richness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser degree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three most carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest, suggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low biodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity. Yet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality which favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels.

TI  - Short-term soil CO2 emission after conventional and reduced tillage of a no-till sugar cane area in southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of tillage systems on soil CO2 emission is a complex issue as different soil types are managed in various ways, from no-till to intensive land preparation. In southern Brazil, the adoption of a new management option has arisen most recently, with no-tillage as well as no burning of crops residues left on soil surface after harvesting, especially in sugar cane areas. Although such practice has helped to restore soil carbon, the tillage impact on soil carbon loss in such areas has not been widely investigated. This study evaluated the effect of moldboard plowing followed by offset disk harrow and chisel plowing on clay oxisolCO(2) emission in a sugar cane field treated with no-tillage and high crop residues input in the last 6 years. Emissions after tillage were compared to undisturbed soil CO2 emissions during a 4-week period by using an LI-6400 system coupled to a portable soil chamber. Conventional tillage caused the highest emission during almost the whole period studied, except for the efflux immediately following tillage, when the reduced plot produced the highest peak. The lowest emissions were recorded 7 days after tillage, at the end of a dry period, when soil moisture reached its lowest rate. A linear regression between Soil CO2 effluxes and soil moisture in the no-till and conventional plots corroborate the fact that moisture, and not soil temperature, was a controlling factor. Total soil CO2 loss was huge and indicates that the adoption of reduced tillage would considerably decrease soil carbon dioxide emission in our region, particularly during the summer season and when growers leave large amounts of crop residues on the soil surface. Although it is known that crop residues are important for restoring soil carbon, our result indicates that an amount equivalent to approximately 30% of annual crop carbon residues could be transferred to the atmosphere, in a period of 4 weeks only, when conventional tillage is applied on no-tilled soils.

TI  - Impact of organic no-till vegetables systems on soil organic matter in the Atlantic Forest biome
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter is widely recognized as a strategy used to improve soil quality and reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere. A field study was carried out to investigate the effects of cover crops in organic no-till vegetables systems on changes in soil organic matter and CO2-C emissions, in dry and rainy seasons. We hypothesized that CO2-C emissions are higher in conventional till as compared with no-till, and that no-till increases soil C sink. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year cropping sequence involving two crops per year-cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) in winter and eggplant (Solanum melongena L) in summer time. Treatments were no-till on dead mulch of grass (Avena strigosa Schreb. and Zea mays L.), leguminous (Lupinus albus L and Crotalaria juncea L.), intercrop (grass and leguminous) and conventional till (no dead mulch) with rotary hoe arranged in a randomized block design on a clayey Oxisol (Typic Haplustox) at Domingos Martins-ES, Brazil. On 2012 and 2013, disturbed soil samples at three different layers (0-5,5-15 and 15-30 cm) and undisturbed samples at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm, for chemical and organic matter characterization were taken. CO2-C emissions and soil temperature were measured in situ on March, May, August and October 2012 and February 2013 (after 3 years of experiment). Conventional till site showed the lowest microporosity values and the highest macroporosity, followed by lower soil bulk density at 0-10 cm layer. Total organic C ranged from 34.94 to 50.48 g kg(-1) in intercrop and 27.11 to 43.74 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Total N ranged from 2.81 to 5.34 g kg(-1) in grass and 2.54 to 4.51 g kg(-1) in conventional till. Highest C stock was recorded in intercrop. Conventional till showed lower labile C values while recalcitrant C was higher in the intercrop treatment. The annual average of CO2-C emissions (mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) followed the order: grass (15.89) > intercrop (13.77) > leguminous (13.09) > conventional till (11.20). Highest annual average of soil temperature was recorded in conventional till (23.95 degrees C). Lowest annual mean of soil water content, microbial biomass C, and highest metabolic quotient were recorded in conventional till. These results suggest that the use of cover crops and organic compost in pre-planting promote C increments. The contribution of organic residues increases the water holding capacity and reduces soil temperature. No-till reduces soil disturbance and promotes a positive balance of C. Organic no-till vegetable systems is a strategy to increase soil C and should be encouraged in order to increase soil quality in the Atlantic Forest Biome in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Allocation of water reservoirs to fight forest fires according to the risk of occurrence
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although forest fires are indispensable for some ecosystems, they can have profound economic, environmental, and social implications, especially when they reach high intensities. There are two crucial factors in fighting forest fires: the availability of water resources and the service network. The objective of this study was to propose an alternative methodology for allocating water reservoirs to fight forest fires. The research was divided into three stages: zoning of fire risk, delimitation of viable areas for the implementation of water reservoirs, and determining strategic locations for reservoir allocation. The variables analyzed were land use and occupation, provision of watercourses, relief orientation, slope, proximity to roads, temperature, and precipitation. Fuzzy logic, Euclidean distance, and network analysis were used as the modeling techniques. Scenarios with all risk classes and only the high- and very high-risk classes were analyzed. A total of 66% of the area was represented by the low- and moderate-risk fire classes and 53.16% had a low potential for reservoir allocation, influenced by the low availability of water resources in the area. The proposed model efficiently allocated the water collection points in the different scenarios, and allowed the determination of the areas most susceptible to the occurrence of forest fires and the optimal locations for the installation of reservoirs, with the allocation of 21 water reservoirs to attend the areas of high- and very high-risk of occurrence of fires at a safe speed (40 km h-1) and 47 reservoirs to meet all risk classes at the same speed. The proposed methodology is feasible, applicable, and adjustable and can be implemented in other conservation units and areas of economic interest.

AB  - Recovery assessment of forest conditions after disruption, especially after logging, tends to vary depending on the aspects viewed and who judges. Forests after logging will recovery through succession naturally based on the characteristics of typical carrying capacity and level of damage to the function of time. The purpose of this study is to determine the variation of recovery rates of natural forest stands after logging in different conditions and vary age after logging. The approach to assessing the recovery rate of natural forest stands after logging based on the biometric characteristic performance formulation values, as mentioned as BCP value. The BCP value was constructed and compiled based on the results of studies on permanent STREK plots in KHDTK Labanan The BCP value is based on four crucial variables, which included: stand density, periodic increments of basal area, evenness index and species abundance. Forest stand conditions on age 1-23 years after logging, the range of BCP values are 11.99-23.48 shows a still low recovery rate. The implications of the BCP value on its four constituent components provide direction for silvicultural treatment needed in order to accelerate the increase of forest stand productivity and ecological review of its constituent biodiversity.

TI  - Influence of no-tillage and frequency of a green manure legume in crop rotations for balancing N outputs and preserving soil organic C stocks
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of crop production systems depends on the adoption of practices that allow the balancing of nutrient output and the preservation of soil organic matter. In Brazil, no-tillage (NT) is widely adopted for soybean-based cropping systems. In the Southern region, soybean alternates with maize in the summer and black-oats or wheat in the winter. Green-manure legumes are occasionally introduced in the crop rotation to break the continuous use of wheat in the winter. The objective of the present study was to evaluate if NT adoption would increase biological nitrogen fixation to soybean and other legumes. The hypothesis that a system richer in N would bring about positive effects on soil C stocks, was also tested. The study was carried out in Londrina, Parana State, in Southern Brazil on a clayey Ferralsol that was cropped under NT with soybean as the main crop for more than 25 years. In 1997, three different crop rotations under both NT and conventional plough tillage (CT) were introduced. The crop rotations were composed of soybean, maize, wheat, black-oats and white lupins, but differed from each other in the frequency that each crop appeared in the rotation. Crop yields and the biomass of lupins and blackoats were quantified at every harvest during the 12 years of this study. Conversion factors of measured yield and biomass into C and biologically fixed N inputs to the crop system were developed from whole plant measurements performed in four of the twelve years of the study. The contribution of biological N-2 fixation (BNF) to the legumes was determined using the ureide abundance and the N-15 natural abundance techniques in 1998, 1999, 2005 and 2007. From these data, the calculation of N balance for each rotation (input N minus output N in harvested grain) was carried out. Soil C and N stocks to 80 cm depth were quantified in 1997, 2003 and 2009. Grain yields were higher under NT for soybean and under CT for maize, in the rotation with the lowest frequency of legume crops. Soybean reliance on BNF was higher under NT (76%) than under CT (68%) whilst for lupins the reliance was 68% under NT and 60% under CT. The use of lupins as a green manure represented an extra contribution to soil N of approximately 300 kg N ha(-1) and this was essential to maintain a positive N balance for the system. The comparison of soil C stocks between 1997 and 2009 revealed almost no gain in soil C under NT, but a C loss of 19 Mg C ha(-1) after 12 years of CT. Significant soil C and N losses were recorded in the rotation where lupins were planted more frequently and fertilizer N application to maize was suspended, which resulted in a very negative N balance for the system. The results highlight the importance of NT to enhance BNF inputs to the system and the need to recognize the N balance as a key driver of C stock changes in the soil. In addition, it suggests NT in this study had the consequence of avoiding soil C loss rather than increasing soil C stocks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the effects of oil palm replanting on arthropod biodiversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Palm oil is the most traded vegetable oil worldwide. Production is concentrated in Southeast Asia, where established oil palm plantations dominate the landscape in many regions. Although levels of biodiversity are much lower than in forest, mature oil palm plantations can support a wide range of generalist species. However, these species may be threatened, as large areas of plantation have already been, or will soon be, replanted as they near the end of their productive life (20-30 years). Replanting changes vegetation complexity and microclimate, but short- and long-term effects on biodiversity are largely unstudied. We surveyed an oil palm chronosequence (first-generation mature palms, and replanted second-generation palms aged 1, 3 and 8 years) in an industrial plantation in Riau, Indonesia to assess the impacts of replanting over an 8-year period on arthropods in the ground, understorey and canopy microhabitats. Replanting was carried out using current recommended strategies, which included staggering replanting events to promote landscape-level heterogeneity, retaining mature oil palm riparian buffers, planting a cover crop immediately after replanting, and using chopped mature palms as mulch after clearance. We assessed changes in total arthropod abundance and order-level community composition, as well as specific changes in spider communities. We observed no significant declines in total arthropod abundance after replanting, but arthropod order-level community composition varied across the chronosequence in all microhabitats. These findings were replicated, or more pronounced, in spider-specific analyses. Spider abundance and species richness decreased in the understorey in the first year after replanting (although these returned to pre-replanting levels after 3 years), and spider species-level community composition in all microhabitats differed significantly across the chronosequence. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that total arthropod abundance is resilient to replanting of oil palm, but that replanting changes total arthropod and spider community composition and decreases spider abundance and species richness in some microhabitats. While it is somewhat encouraging from a management perspective that recommended replanting strategies maintain overall arthropod abundance, the changes in arthropod composition and spider biodiversity that we observed may impact ecosystem processes, such as pest control, in second-generation oil palm plantations, with potential implications for yield. Additional studies that focus on other taxonomic groups and assess the effects of individual replanting strategies are needed before the long-term ecological impacts of replanting on existing oil palm plantations can be fully determined.

AB  - Kurnianto AS, Haryadi NT, Dewi N, Miftachurrohmi, Rohmana A, Amal GI, Septiadi L, Firdaus AS, Magvira NL. 2023. Edge effects at multifunctional agro-landscapes in Jember, Indonesia, on the augmentation of butterfly diversity. Biodiversitas 24: 2231-2241. Butterflies are important pollinators and bioindicator communities in agro-landscapes. Assessing changes in butterfly communities, such as abundance and diversity, is essential in evaluating the response of butterflies to ecosystem disturbance. However, edge effects on agro-landscapes are highly influenced by land management. This study aims to objectively investigate the interactions between agroforestry management, including mono-shade, complex, and agroforestry-monoculture systems, with butterfly diversity to assess the impact of edge effects on butterfly communities. Sampling was conducted using Van Sommeren traps (T = 150 cm; D = 30 cm) baited with fermented bananas. Each trap was hung three meters high on a tree with three replicates in one location. Within 24 hours, the butterflies were collected, dried in an oven for 3x24 hours, and identified. The ecological indices were calculated using PAST 3.26, including the Shannon-Wiener index, the Simpson dominance index (D), the Simpson diversity index (1_D), the Margalef index, and the Evenness index. Therefore, 61 specimens, including 59 Nymphalidae and 2 Pieridae, were successfully collected. There are Nympahlidae families: Amathusia phidippus Linnaeus, 1763 (1), Elymnias casiphone Hubner, 1824 (2), Elymnias hypermnestra Linnaeus, 1763 (2), Euthalia aconthea Cramer, 1779 (1), Euthalia monina Fabricius, 1787 (1), Junonia atlites Linnaeus, 1763 (1), Junonia iphita Cramer, 1782 (1), Lethe europa Fabricius, 1775 (1), Melanitis leda Linnaeus, 1758 (24), Melanitis phedima Cramer, 1782 (4), Mycalesis fuscum Felder, 1860 (2), Mycalesis horsfieldi Moore, 1892 (1), Mycalesis janardana Moore, 1857 (6), Mycalesis nala Felder, 1859 (1), Mycaleses perseus Fabricius, 1775 (1), Mycalesis sudra Felder, 1867 (2), Orsotriaena cinerea Butler, 1867 (1), Orsotriaena medus Fabricius, 1775 (2), Polyura athamas Drury, 1773 (3), Polyura schreiberi Godart, 1824 (1), Tanaecia trigerta Moore, 1857 (1). There are families Pieridae: Leptosia nina Fabricius, 1793 (1), Eurema blanda Boisduval, 1836 (2). Comparison between complex and monoculture sites showed substantial differences. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between mono-shade and monoculture sites. Butterfly diversity at the three locations was categorized as moderate. The highest diversity was observed in mono-shade sites. The three similarity indices showed that the agroforestry complex and monoculture locations have high similarity. Melanitis leda Linnaeus, 1758 was found in 3 sites and commonly found in complex sites (16), followed by monoculture (6) and mono-shade (2). This study indicated that edge effects have a significant influence, especially on the diversity of butterflies in the monoculture area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gibellula (Cordycipitaceae) includes widely distributed spider pathogenic fungi. This study describes a novel species, Gibellula agroflorestalis, recorded in agroforestry systems (AFS) and Atlantic Forest remnants in Pernambuco State, northeastern Brazil. The morphology of synnemata and conidiophores was studied, and phylogenetic analyses used SSU, LSU and TEF1 data in order to confirm the distinctiveness of the new species. The new species presents particular morphological characteristics, such as lacrimoid conidia and white synnemata. Comparison with other species in the genus revealed significant differences both in conidial and synnematal morphology. Based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference phylogenies, G. agroflorestalis is a sister species to G. pulchra. The variations observed in the samples may be attributed to the microenvironmental conditions of AFS, which can influence phenotypic expression. This research emphasizes the importance of AFS in biodiversity conservation and in the discovery of new species.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna in Differents Systems of Land Use Soil in Upper River Solimoes, AM, Brazil.
T2  - Neotropical Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - The mesofauna has an important function in the soil and it is represented mainly by Acari Oribatida and Collembola. We report the first data on the density and diversity of the soil mesofauna in Benjamin Constant, Amazonas State, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry system, cultivated areas and pastures. A total of 101 samples were collected 100 m apart from each other and specimens were collected by using Berlese-Tullgren method. The highest density was registered in secondary forest (29,776 specimens.m-2). Acari Oribatida was the dominant group (7.072 specimens.m-2) in the pasture, suggesting that mites show higher capacity of adaptation to disturbed environments and/or due to the presence of gregarious species. The density of Collembola (5,632 specimens.m-2) was higher in secondary forest. Formicidae was the dominant group (27,824 specimens.m-2) and its highest density occurred in the secondary forest (12,336 specimens.m-2). Seven species and ten morphospecies of Isoptera and three species of Symphyla were identified. The highest density and diversity were found in secondary forest. One supposes that the low density of mesofauna found in all of the studied systems is being influenced by soil structure and composition as well as litter volume. For SUT, the composition of taxonomic groups in the cultivated areas is similar to the one found in primary forest, while the groups found in the agroforestry system are similar to those in the pasture, which may help to decide on land use strategies.

TI  - Separating the two faces of "bioeconomy": Plantation economy and sociobiodiverse economy in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the metadiscourse of bioeconomy and the ways in which bioeconomy is gaining new meanings in Brazil. We argue that the currently unfolding framing of Amazonian diverse economies in natural forests as part of a bioeconomy-on a par with, for example, soybean plantations-is a dangerous and misleading path. Recent reports framing the Amazon as a potential hotspot of bioeconomy are critically scrutinized. We find it important to disintegrate the all-embracing bio-concept that refers to anything "bio" and make visible and strengthen a radical and sustainable version of the bio-based economy against the extractive economy of the plantation. It is essential to analyze how land use practices impact diversity, both in the biological sphere and in social organization. We contrast and compare two types of land use based economies, the "plantation economy" and the "sociobiodiverse economy" offering a toolbox with which to analyze the nature of land use based economies when they expand over new territories and political economic systems. We explore how these two logics of land use compete for the same land and rule each other out, as rivals, using agroforestry and plantation studies as a basis. We find that the term bioeconomy has become so conflated that it cannot be rescued to serve the development of sociobiodiverse economies, such as agroecology or agroforestry. We conclude by making policy suggestions from a more global development perspective, situating the bioeconomy framing into the current moment of converging global crises.

AB  - Management intensification in cultivated, tropical forests drives changes in the microclimate that can threaten native forest. ora and fauna. In this study, we use epiphytic bryophytes, known to be sensitive to microclimatic changes due to their lack of a protective cuticle and the exposed habitat, to investigate the predictive power of microclimate for changes in species richness and composition. Bryophytes were sampled from understory trees in natural forest and cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) trees in two types of cacao agroforests (natural shade trees and planted shade trees) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The microclimate in the agroforests was characterised by low air humidity and high air temperature during the afternoon. Bryophyte species richness did not differ between habitat types but species composition changed markedly from the natural forest to the cacao agroforests. Although no correlation between species richness and microclimate values could be found, a series of matrix-based analyses revealed a significantly positive relationship between similarities in species composition and inmaximum values for temperature and minimum values for humidity, which suggests that microclimatic changes are a good predictor for high turnover of bryophyte community composition from natural forests to cacao agroforests.

TI  - Shade tree management affects fruit abortion, insect pests and pathogens of cacao
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mortality of cacao fruits caused by early fruit abortion or insect and pathogen attacks was investigated in differently managed agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Nine agroforestry systems shaded by three different types of tree stands were selected, which represented a decrease in structural heterogeneity: forest remnants, diverse planted trees and one or two species of planted leguminose trees. After standardized manual cross-pollination, the development of 600 fruits on 54 trees (6 trees per agroforest) was followed during 18 weeks of fruit development. In total, 432 of all fruits were lost before maturity, which seriously undermined yields. The proportion of harvested fruits per tree (overall average: 27 +/- 4%) was not affected by canopy type. Although shade cover did not have a significant effect, losses due to fruit abortion were most likely under forest shade, where nitrogen-fixing leguminose shade trees were absent. Fruit losses due to pathogenic infections and insect attacks increased with the homogenization of the agroforests, supporting the hypothesis that agricultural homogenization increases risks of pest outbreaks. In conclusion, shade management may be improved to increase yields from cacao using highly diversified natural shade agroforestry systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The contribution of agroforestry systems to reducing farmers' dependence on the resources of adjacent national parks: a case study from Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is much debate about the way conservation and development are best integrated to reduce the encroachment pressures of poor rural communities on the biodiversity resources of protected areas in the tropics. One frequently recommended instrument is to intensify farming systems in the adjacent areas, so as to decrease the need to harvest resources from national parks. This study examined this issue by analyzing the effects of different household land uses in villages near a national park on their propensity to harvest resources from the park. In the northern part of the Kerinci Seblat National Park (Sumatra Island, Indonesia) the park buffer zone is comprised largely of community or village forests and human settlements. The village forests were formerly managed as production forests and provided significant cash income to the village. They were converted into farmland, particularly to mixed-tree gardens or agroforests. Natural forest coverage has now declined to 10% of the former area within village forest land. We analyzed the characteristics of the mixed gardens and village forests, and their practical contribution to reducing farmers' dependence on the adjacent national park resources. Households with farms that were more diversified were found to have much less dependency on the national park resources. Households that farmed only wetland rice fields registered the highest value of forest products obtained from inside the park. Households that farmed only mixed gardens had an intermediate level of park resource extraction, while those that had farms composed of both components (i.e. wetland rice fields and mixed gardens) had a dramatically lower level of economic dependency on park resources than households in either of the other two categories.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY OF MYRMECOFAUNA AND ARANEOFAUNA ASSOCIATED WITH AGROECOSYSTEM AND FOREST FRAGMENTS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH CARABIDAE AND STAPHYLINIDAE (COLEOPTERA)
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Faunistic and statistical analyses of species diversity of the mimercofauna and araneofauna associated with variously managed agricultural fields and adjacent forest fragments and their interactions with Carabidae and Staphylinidae (Coleoptera) are needed to identify the key species affecting the dynamics within the arthropod population affecting the agroecosystem. This knowledge is needed to devise more effective integrated pest management programs. In this study, a population survey of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and spiders (Araneae) was performed. The aims of this work were to determine the dominant species, to examine the fauna through several indexes and to evaluate the occurrence of adverse interaction between these arthropods and Carabidae and Staphylinidae (Coleoptera). The experimental areas were located in Guaira City, Sao Paulo, Brazil, which consists of forest fragments and soybean/corn crops under no-tillage and conventional systems. The arthropods were sampled by pitfall traps from Nov 2004 to Apr 2007. The traps were distributed along 2 transects of 200 m long with 100 m each in 2 fields in corn/soybean rotations and 100 m in the forest fragments adjacent to these agricultural fields. The fauna were characterized by diversity indices, evenness, similarity, abundance, dominance, frequency and consistency and interspecific interactions by Pearson's correlation. The ants, Pheidole spp. and Camponotus bland us, and the spider, Trochosa sp. were dominant in the no-till and conventionally tilled corn/soybean fields. The diversities of spider and ant species were high in the forest fragments, and at the forest-crop interface. Indeed ant species were highly and similarly diverse in all of the habitats, whereas the diversity of ant species was substantially less in no-till than in conventionally tilled corn/soybean fields. The density of the ant, Pheidole sp.1, correlated negatively with that of spiders, carabids, and staphylinids in the no-till soybean/corn fields.

TI  - No-tillage and fertilization effectively improved soil carbon and nitrogen in a subtropical Ferralsol
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - No-tillage farming combined with temporary cattle grazing is becoming a common practice in parts of South America. We quantified the effects of no-tillage and winter grazing of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) on soil carbon and nitrogen stock, stratification ratio (concentration in 0-5 to 10-20-cm layer) and lability (based on particulate organic matter, POM), relative to conventional tillage or ungrazed ryegrass. A 9-year-old experiment was conducted in a southern Brazilian Ferralsol. Soil under no-tillage accumulated 1.11 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.10 Mg N ha(-1) year(-1) to 100-cm depth relative to conventional tillage when ryegrass was not grazed, and also increased the stratification ratio of carbon (1.48 vs. 1.11) and nitrogen (1.66 vs. 1.17). The carbon and nitrogen lability was also greater in no-tillage soil, as carbon and nitrogen stocks increased proportionally more in sand-POM than in silt or clay size fractions (carbon lability index = 1.57 vs. 1.00; nitrogen lability index = 1.57 vs. 1.00). Semiquinone concentrations in physical fractions were 4-28% smaller in no-tillage, suggesting less organic matter aromaticity in this treatment. Grazing, however, caused no further improvement of stocks of carbon and nitrogen in the 0-100-cm layer of no-tillage soil (e.g., 209 vs. 212 Mg C ha(-1), ns), or enhancement of stratification or lability of those elements, relative to ungrazed ryegrass. Overall, no-tillage effectively promoted soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation and lability in this subtropical Ferralsol, whereas grazing did not compromise the gains of no-tillage.

TI  - BIOCHAR AS SOIL CONDITIONER IN THE SUCCESSION OF UPLAND RICE AND COWPEA FERTILIZED WITH NITROGEN
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of biochar and nitrogen application on yields of upland rice and cowpea and on soil fertility were determined in a greenhouse in Macaiba, RN, Brazil. The trial consisted of the succession of two crops in a completely randomized design and a factorial scheme, with four replicates. Initially, four doses of biochar and four doses of nitrogen were tested for cultivation of rice. Subsequently, four doses of biochar and two doses of nitrogen were tested in half of the pots maintained for planting cowpea. Soil was sampled after rice harvest for half of the pots and at end of the trial for the remaining pots. We evaluated the following parameters: mass of hundred grains of rice, dry shoot mass, panicle number, number of filled spikelets and of empty spikelets, and grain production. Determinations for cowpea were: pod number per pot, grain number per pod, and grain production per pot. Measured soil parameters were: pH, contents of organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable sodium percentage. Biochar addition did not influence yield components of upland rice and cowpea, but resulted in increased soil N retention, which influenced rice dry shoot mass, spikelets sterility, panicle number, and grain mass. Biochar also promoted increased soil pH, potassium content, and exchangeable sodium percentage and decreased calcium and magnesium concentrations.

TI  - Effects of crop rotation and sheep grazing management on the seedbank and emerged weed flora under a no-tillage integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective integrated weed management in agricultural landscapes depends on the ability to identify and manage processes that drive weed dynamics. The current study reports the effects of grazing management and crop rotation strategies on the seedbank and emerged weed flora in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) experiment during a 12-year period under no-tillage in sub-tropical southern Brazil. During winter, Italian ryegrass cover crops were grazed by sheep: grazing management treatments included two stocking methods (continuous and rotational) and two forage allowances (10 and 20 kg of herbage dry matter available per 100 kg animal live weight). During summer, the crop rotation treatments involved either soybean-maize or soybean-soybean in succession with winter-grazed cover crops. The treatments were part of a factorial randomized complete block design. Treatment effects were evaluated on the weed seedbank and emerged weed flora populations during winter-grazed cover crop and summer crop growth as well as during the harvest phase. The current results demonstrate that crop rotation and grazing management exhibited interactive effects on the determination of weed outcomes in an ICLS. However, overall, compared with moderate forage allowance, high forage allowance during the winter-grazed cover crop caused lower emerged weed flora in subsequent crops (20% reduction during crop growth and 90% reduction at crop harvest) and 48% reduction in seedbank size. High forage allowance promoted more residue from winter-grazed cover crop biomass, which remained during the summer crop phases and probably resulted in a physical barrier to weed emergence.

TI  - Dataset on microclimate and drone-based thermal patterns within an oil palm agroforestry system
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Microclimate and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are important analytical variables used to understand complex oil palm agroforestry systems and their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. In order to examine experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and Land Surface Temperature, related data were collected following a strict design. The experiment was carried out in the Jambi province, in Sumatra (Indonesia), as part of the collaborative project EFForTS [Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems]. Microclimate data collected using miniaturized data loggers combined with drone-based thermal data were considered within an oil palm plantation enriched with six target tree species. The time-frame considered for data analysis was 20th September 2017 to 26th September 2017. The experiment data can be used for comparison with data from conventional oil palm agroforestry systems in the tropics. They can more specifically be used as reference to assess microclimate and Land Surface Temperature patterns within similar agroforestry systems. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The diversity of termite species on natural forest and agroforestry land in Sulawesi tropical forests in Indonesia
T2  - Annals of Silvicultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of natural forest to agroforestry causes physical changes in the forest, which affects the availability of or-ganic matter. Therefore, this could influence the diversity of termites which act as decomposers in forest ecosystems. This study aims to determine the effect on the diversity of termite species of changes in tropical forest due to conversion. The study was carried out in the Educational Forest area of Tadulako University, Indonesia. The observations of environmental biophysical conditions include vegetation diversity, biomass, soil physical and chemical properties. Furthermore, using the transect method, the diversity of termite species was monitored. The results showed that the diversity of termite species decreased along with the conversion, because 13 species were found in natural forests, while only seven species were found in agroforestry land. This implies that changes in the bio-physical environmental conditions due to forest conversion of tropical rainforests significantly reduced the number and composition of vegetation types at all growth rates, necromass and litter biomass. This decrease affects the availability of soil organic matter and carbon. Furthermore, these changes led not only to the loss of individual species but also to the emergence of previously unrecorded ones such as Microcerotermes dubius.

TI  - Comparing airborne and terrestrial LiDAR with ground-based inventory metrics of vegetation structural complexity in oil palm agroforests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation structural complexity is an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing biodiversity and functioning. Due to the heterogeneous distribution of vegetation elements, structural complexity underpins ecological dynamics, species composition, microclimate, and habitat diversity. Field measurements and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, such as airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS), can assess structural characteristics of forest and agroforestry systems at various spatial scales. This assessment is urgently needed for monitoring ecosystem restoration in degraded lands (e.g., in oil palm landscapes), where it is not well-known how structural measures derived from these different approaches relate to each other. Here, we compared the degree of correlation between individual and multivariate datasets of vegetation structural complexity metrics derived from ALS, TLS, and ground-based inventory approaches. The study was conducted in a 140 ha oil palm monoculture, enriched with 52 plots in the form of tree islands representing agroforestry systems of varying sizes and planted diversity levels in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our datasets comprised 25 ALS, five TLS, and nine groundbased inventory metrics. We studied correlations among metrics related to traditional stand summary, heterogeneity, and vertical and horizontal stand structure. We used principal component analysis for data dimensionality reduction, correlation analysis to quantify the strength of relationships between metrics, and Procrustes analysis to investigate the agreement between datasets. Significant correlations were found between ALS and TLS metrics for canopy density (r = 0.79) and maximum tree height (r = 0.58) and between ALS and ground-based inventory measures of stand heterogeneity and height diversity (r between 0.60 and -0.63). Further, we observed significant agreements between the ordinations of multivariate datasets (r = 0.56 for ALS - TLS; and r = 0.46 for ALS - ground-based inventory). Our findings underline the ability of ALS to capture structural complexity patterns, especially for canopy gap dynamics and vegetation height metrics, as captured by TLS, and for measures of heterogeneity and vertical structure as captured by ground-based inventories. Our study highlights the strength of each approach and underscores the potential of integrating ALS and TLS with ground-based inventories for a comprehensive characterization of vegetation structure in complex agroforestry systems, which can provide guidance for their management and support ecosystem restoration monitoring efforts.

TI  - Arthropod Community Structure Indicating Soil Quality Recovery in the Organic Agroecosystem of Mount Ciremai National Park's Buffer Zone
T2  - CARAKA TANI-JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mount Ciremai National Park (TNGC) buffer zone is designed to support conservation efforts. However, agriculture in this area is dominated by conventional farming that excessively uses synthetic fertilizers, which threatens soil quality. Introducing an organic fertilizer and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is expected to enhance soil quality recovery in this area. This study aimed to analyze the differences in soil arthropod communities between organic and conventional agriculture and a forest in the TNGC buffer zone to assess soil quality improvement generated by the application of the organic fertilizer and PGPR. Soil arthropods were collected with Berlese-Tullgren funnels and pitfall traps. Several associated environmental parameters, including soil pH, C-organic, temperature, and moisture, were also measured. Data were analyzed using ecological indices (i.e., richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, similarity) and soil biological quality (QBS-ar). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed to examine the relation of arthropods with environmental parameters. In total, 957 individuals of soil arthropods belonging to four classes and 15 orders were recorded. Berlese-Tullgren and pitfall traps resulted in a similar tendency in most variables, with higher richness, diversity, and evenness values in the forest, followed by organic and conventional habitats. In addition, similarity and QBS-ar indicated that forest and organic communities were more similar than conventional community. C-organic, soil moisture and pH were considered the most deciding environmental parameters for arthropod assemblages. All measured variables in this study illustrated better soil quality in organic than in conventional agriculture. This study implicates the benefit of utilizing organic fertilizers and PGPR for soil quality restoration in agroecosystems.

TI  - A decade of land use contributes to changes in the chemistry, biochemistry and bacterial community structures of soils in the Cerrado
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The bacterial community structures (BCSs) of Cerrado soils cultivated under conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT) and under native Cerrado (NC) vegetation were evaluated using PCR/DGGE of bacterial 16S rRNA (rrs) and rpoB genes and of Pseudomonas group genes. Soil chemical analysis, microbial biomass and the enzyme activities were also evaluated and correlated with the BCS measurements. The multivariate ordinations of DGGE profiles showed differences between the BCS of the NC area and those from cultivated areas. The BCSs of the CT and NT areas also differed in all DGGE fingerprints, including changes in the profile of Pseudomonas populations, indicating that agricultural systems can also be responsible for changes within specific microbial niches, although the clearest differences were found in the rpoB profiles. The MRPP analysis demonstrated significant differences between the BCSs from different soil layers of NT areas based on all gene fingerprints and those of NC areas based on bacterial 16S rRNA and rpoB genes fingerprints. No differences were observed in the microbial fingerprints of CT samples from different depths, indicating that ploughing affected the original BCS stratification. The BCS from NC areas, based on all gene fingerprints, could be related to higher levels of soil acidity and higher amounts of MBC and of phosphatase activity. In contrast, the BCSs from cultivated areas were related to higher levels of Ca + Mg, P and K, likely as a result of a history of chemical fertilisation in these areas. The relationships between rpoB and Pseudomonas BCSs and all chemical and biochemical properties of soils were significant, according to a Mantel test (P < 0.05), indicating that the different changes in soil properties induced by soil use or management may drive the formation of the soil BCS.

TI  - Diversity of the edaphic macrofauna in areas managed under no-tillage for different periods
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture can considerably change the composition and richness of the edaphic macrofauna, affecting the ecological and biological functions exerted by the fauna. This study was carried out in commercial production systems in the municipality of Guaira, state of Parana, Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of no-tillage systems (NTS) and seasonality on the diversity, richness, and composition of the edaphic macrofauna. Three areas managed under NTS for different periods 7 years (NTS-7), 14 years (NTS-14), and 23 years (NTS-23) under crop succession with soybean (summer) (aNTS7) and maize/wheat (winter) (NTS14 and NTS23) were evaluated, in addition to a native Atlantic Forest segment, which was used as a reference. Faunal samples were collected in the thy season (September 2013) and rainy season (February 2014). The edaphic macrofauna was evaluated using the method proposed by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Program. Parametric statistics were applied, and the results were compared using Tukey's test at a level of significance of 5%. Species density and total richness were usually higher in the NTS14 and NTS23 in the thy season. However, higher indexes of equability were not detected because of the dominance of groups Formicidae and Isoptera. The areas with the highest equability were the reference area in the thy season and NTS23 in the rainy season, corresponding to 0.87 and 0.61, respectively. These results indicate the higher faunal diversity in these areas, which reflects the greater stability of the ecosystem.

TI  - BIOMASS AND NUTRIENT DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH SLASH FIRES IN NEOTROPICAL DRY FORESTS
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented rates of deforestation and biomass burning in tropical dry forests are dramatically influencing biogeochemical cycles, resulting in resource depletion, declines in biodiversity, and atmospheric pollution. We quantified the effects of deforestation and varying levels of slash-fire severity on nutrient losses and redistribution in a second-growth tropical dry forest (''Caatinga'') near Serra Talhada, Pernambuco, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass prior to burning was almost-equal-to 74 Mg/ha. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were highest in litter, leaves attached to slash, and fine wood debris (<0.64 cm diameter). While these components comprised only 30% of the prefire aboveground biomass, they accounted for almost-equal-to 60% of the aboveground pools of N and P. Three experimental fires were conducted during the 1989 burning season. In these treatments consumption was 78, 88, and 95% of the total aboveground biomass. As much as 96% of the prefire aboveground N and C pools and 56% of the prefire aboveground P pool was lost during combustion processes. Nitrogen losses exceeded 500 kg/ha and P losses exceeded 20 kg/ha in the fires of the greatest severity. With increasing fire severity, the concentrations of N and P in ash decreased while the concentration of Ca increased. This indicates greater amounts of these nutrients were volatilized (i.e., greater ecosystem losses occurred) with increasing fire severity. Following fire, up to 47% of the residual aboveground N and 84% of the residual aboveground P were in the form of ash, which was quickly lost from the site via wind erosion. Fires appeared to have a minor immediate effect on total N, C, or P in the soils. However, soils in forests with no history of cultivation had significantly higher concentrations of C and P than second-growth forests. Based upon the measured losses of nutrients from these single slash-burning events, it would likely require a century or more of fallow for reaccumulation to occur. However, current fallow periods in this region are 15 yr or less.

TI  - Soil-Borne Bacterial Structure and Diversity Does Not Reflect Community Activity in Pampa Biome
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pampa biome is considered one of the main hotspots of the world's biodiversity and it is estimated that half of its original vegetation was removed and converted to agricultural land and tree plantations. Although an increasing amount of knowledge is being assembled regarding the response of soil bacterial communities to land use change, to the associated plant community and to soil properties, our understanding about how these interactions affect the microbial community from the Brazilian Pampa is still poor and incomplete. In this study, we hypothesized that the same soil type from the same geographic region but under distinct land use present dissimilar soil bacterial communities. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the soil bacterial communities from four land-uses within the same soil type by 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene and by soil microbial activity analyzes. We found that the same soil type under different land uses harbor similar (but not equal) bacterial communities and the differences were controlled by many microbial taxa. No differences regarding diversity and richness between natural areas and areas under anthropogenic disturbance were detected. However, the measures of microbial activity did not converge with the 16S rRNA data supporting the idea that the coupling between functioning and composition of bacterial communities is not necessarily correlated.

TI  - Non-target impact of deltamethrin on soil arthropods of maize fields under conventional and no-tillage cultivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deltamethrin is a commonly used insecticide for controlling its key maize pest, the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lep., Noctuidae). Its toxicological profile is well known, but its impact on arthropods widely reported as bioindicators, mainly springtails (Collembola) and mites (Oribatida), is yet to be assessed in tropical maize fields. The treatments used to circumvent this shortcoming were conventional cultivation and no-tillage cultivation (with a pre-sowing application of 2,4-D and glyphosate) systems with or without deltamethrin spraying. The deltamethrin residue analysis of soil samples by gas chromatography did not detect the insecticide 24 h after it was sprayed on the maize fields. There was no significant overall effect of deltamethrin based on principal component analysis. However, repeated-measures analyses of variance detected significant impact of deltamethrin in a species of Nitidulidae (Coleoptera). The cultivation system also provided significant impact on Oribatida and Gamasida soil mites and on the same Nitidulidae species referred above, which were more abundant in the conventional cultivation system. Springtails were also significantly affected by the cultivation system showing greater abundance in the conventional system, except Podumorpha. Analyses using only high taxonomic levels did not allow the detection of impact in the ant assemblage assessed. The results suggest that the impact of deltamethrin on soil arthropods from tropical fields varies among species and is lower than expected. The cultivation system imposes more drastic effects on arthropod assemblage.

TI  - Landscape and farm scale management to enhance biodiversity conservation in the cocoa producing region of southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, large land areas are used for the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which is predominantly grown under the shade of native trees in an agroforestry system locally known as cabruca. As a dominant forest-like landscape element of the cocoa region, the cabrucas play an important role in the conservation of the region's biodiversity. The purpose of this review is to provide the scientific basis for an action plan to reconcile cocoa production and biodiversity conservation in southern Bahia. The available research collectively highlights the diversity of responses of different species and biological groups to both the habitat quality of the cabrucas themselves and to the general characteristics of the landscape, such as the relative extent and spatial configuration of different vegetation types within the landscape mosaic. We identify factors that influence directly or indirectly the occurrence of native species in the cabrucas and the wider landscape of the cocoa region and develop recommendations for their conservation management. We show that the current scientific knowledge already provides a good basis for a biodiversity friendly management of the cocoa region of southern Bahia, although more work is needed to refine some management recommendations, especially on shade canopy composition and density, and verify their economic viability. The implementation of our recommendations should be accompanied by appropriate biological and socioeconomic monitoring and the findings should inform a broad program of adaptive management of the cabrucas and the wider cocoa landscape.

TI  - Effect of a rubber plantation on termite diversity in Melawi, West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - Agriculture and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the negative effects of rubber plantation expansion is the loss of biodiversity in the area. One of the widely used rubber plantation systems is rubber forest agroforestry, which is known to have little effect on biodiversity. This study compared termite species in rubber forest with those in the primary forest within Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in Melawi, Indonesia. Two rubber forest sites (newly opened) and unproductive/old rubber forest, were chosen to estimate the long term effects of rubber forest on termite biodiversity. A standardized transect method was used for termite collection. In total, 35 termite species belonging to eight sub families were collected. Termite species richness in the old rubber forest decreased up to 62.5% compared to that in primary forest sites. In the newly opened rubber forest site, termite species richness was only slightly less than that of the primary forest sites. Termite species richness results corresponded with their functional groups, with no soil feeders found in the old rubber forest. Furthermore, the calculation of several diversity indices also confirmed the results. The results indicated that the expansion of rubber forest in the area appears to have adversely affected termite diversity more than expected. Copyright (C) 2018, Kasetsart University.

TI  - Impact of forest conversion to oil palm and rubber plantations on microclimate and the role of the 2015 ENSO event
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm and rubber expansion is a main driver of the widespread deforestation of tropical rainforests taking place in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The replacement of forests with monoculture plantations of rubber and oil palm reduces biodiversity and carbon pools but also modifies canopy structure, which is an important determinant of microclimate. There is, however, a lack of quantitative information characterizing the effect of such land transformation on microclimate. We report the first medium-term observations of below canopy microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit and soil temperature) across forest, jungle rubber agroforest, oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations in Sumatra/Indonesia. The data set covers a period of approximately three years (2013-2016) and includes one of the strongest El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) of the last decades. Forests were up to 2.3 and 2.2 degrees C cooler than oil palm and rubber monocultures respectively. The monocultures were also drier (11.9% and 12.8% less in oil palm and rubber respectively) and had higher vapour pressure deficit (632 Pa and 665 Pa higher in oil palm and rubber respectively) than the forest, while differences in soil temperature were less pronounced. Conversion from forest to other land uses, especially to monocultures, also amplified the diurnal range of all microclimatic variables studied. Jungle rubber stands out as the transformed land-use system that maintains more stable microclimatic conditions. Our results indicate that canopy openness is a key driver of below-canopy micro climate, and hence could be used in climate models to better evaluate climatic feedbacks of land-use change to rubber and oil palm. The ENSO event of 2015 led to warmer and drier conditions than in the previous two years in all four land-use systems, especially in the forest (up to 2.3 degrees C warmer, 8.9% drier and up to 351 Pa more during ENSO). The relative effect of ENSO was lower in the monoculture plantations, where below-canopy microclimate is generally more similar to open areas. Forests exhibited the largest differences with the pre-ENSO years, but still maintained more stable microclimatic conditions (lower temperatures and vapour pressure deficit and higher relative humidity) due to their higher climate regulation capacity. During ENSO, microclimatic conditions in jungle rubber were comparable to those in the monocultures, suggesting that while forests buffered the increase of temperature, jungle rubber might have surpassed its buffering capacity to extreme events. This capacity of buffering extreme climatic events should be considered when assessing the effects of land-use change.

AB  - Nugroho Y, Supandi, Suyanto, Matatula J, Wirabuana PYAP. 2021. Influence of understorey diversity on wildlife at the coal mining reclamation area in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 3736-3742. The existence of understorey at the coal mining reclamation area provides an important contribution to improve the environmental quality, especially the wildlife presence. Therefore, this study aims to determine the influence of understorey diversity on the wildlife at the coal mining reclamation area managed by the PT Borneo Indobara, South Kalimantan. This study used an ecological survey conducted in three reclamation areas classified based on the dominant species supporting the process, namely Paraserianthes falcataria (L-1), Anthocephalus cadamba (L-2), and a mixture of both species (L-3). The data were collected in two observation periods, namely August 2019 and August 2020. The results showed that at the first observation, ten families of understorey were observed from the survey and the highest diversity was recorded in L-2 (H'=1.71), followed by L-1 (H'=1.54), and L-3 (H'=1.27). Meanwhile, the wildlife in the first periods was only 6 species consisting of 3 birds, 2 reptiles, and 1 mammal. The number of species from every site was relatively equal at the first observation. In the second observation, the diversity of understorey considerably increased with approximately 22 families from the inventory. The highest understorey diversity in this observation was recorded in L-1 (H'=3.30), L-2 (H'=3.05), and L-3 (H'=3.04). Also, the higher understorey diversity was followed by the higher wildlife with 29 species, which consists of 26 birds, 2 reptiles, and 1 mammal. The highest appearance of bird species was in the L-1 with approximately 19 species, while the number of birds in L-2 and L-3 was relatively similar with approximately 15 species. Based on these results, the understorey diversity significantly contributes to improving the wildlife diversity at the coal mining reclamation area, primarily from the bird species.

TI  - The influence of emergent trees on rainfall distribution in a cacao agroforest (Sulawesi, Indonesia)
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent trees may have an influence on the volume and the spatial distribution of water input into agroforestry stands and may thus affect water availability for the main crops. Our goal was to analyze the influence of such trees on rainfall distribution in a cacao agroforest area in the rainforest margin zone of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The emergent trees studied belong to the species Bischofia javanica (Phyllanthaccae) and were 15 m high remnants from the natural forest. A set of 96 throughfall gauges was systematically distributed underneath canopies of cacao only, and underneath canopies of cacao plus emergent trees (cacao plus trees). From an earlier study we knew that stemflow can safely be estimated with less than 1% of gross precipitation (Pg).Median throughfall tended to be lower in gauges underneath cacao plus trees than under cacao only (p <= 0.1), and the estimated rainfall interception loss was 4% and 16% of Pg in cacao only and cacao plus trees plots, respectively. This difference was most likely caused by a tree-induced enhancement of the canopy water storage capacity and an increase in canopy roughness. Underneath the canopy of emergent trees (cacao plus trees), throughfall exceeded gross precipitation east of the tree stems (113%) and was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) west and north of the tree stems (67-77% of Pg). Significant effects of trees on throughfall did not extend beyond their canopy area. We assume that wind-driven rain was stripped out east of the stems causing an increase in throughfall, while rain-shadow effects led to a decrease in throughfall west and north of the tree stems. Thus, at our study site emergent trees tended to reduce rain water input, and produced clear spatial patterns in throughfall distribution. A reduced water availability may lead to reduced cacao bean yields in times of water scarcity but a more complete assessment of the hydrological function of shade trees in agroforestry systems may also reveal positive influences of shade trees on cacao trees. Such an advanced analysis of hydrological functions still remains to be done. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biochars Originating from Different Biomass and Pyrolysis Process Reveal to Have Different Microbial Characterization: Implications for Practice
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable technologies are increasingly promoted in various production areas. Protection of natural resources, as well as rational waste management, may lead to better optimization of technologies. Biochar, a product of pyrolysis of organic residues has found wide applications in waste management, agriculture, energy and construction industry. In the present study biochar samples produced in Poland and in Brazil were analysed for microbial content using three substrates: Plate Count Agar, Malt Agar, and Potato Agar. Both qualitative and quantitative measurements were done. Microscopic analysis of the biochar structure was also performed. We found that microbial cultures in both biochars represented a wide range of biodiversity of microorganisms genera and species. We demonstrate that the biochar samples differ depending on the botanical origin as well as on the production technology. Structure of the tested samples also varied depending on the botanical origin. Sample 1-PL (pine) was characterised by a compact and regular structure, while sample 2-PL (oak) showed porous and irregular structure. Sample from Brazil (1-BR) showed a more delicate structure than Polish biochars. Obtained properties may suggest a range of implications for practice.

TI  - Exploring the impact of cover crops in integrated pest management: pest and natural enemies population dynamics in no-tillage cotton production
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation agriculture plays an important role in the sustainability of production systems, notably for globally significant crops such as cotton. This study explores the integration of the no-tillage system (NTS) with integrated pest management (IPM) by incorporating cover crops. The aim is to assess the impact of these living or dead covers on the management of insect populations, the indices diversity of phytophagous insects and natural enemies, and to investigate the population fluctuation of these arthropods, considering a variety of crops in the NTS before and after cotton planting. The trial, conducted over two consecutive cropping seasons in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, employed a randomised block design with four repetitions. The treatments included cover crops with the highest potential for use in the region, such as millet (Pennisetum glaucum glaucum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), brachiaria (Urochloa ruziziensis), black velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum), forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), and white oats (Avena sativa L.) and a mix of white oats with brachiaria. The results indicated that the black velvet bean stands out as the most effective cover crop, providing the best performance in terms of non-preference to the attack of the evaluated pest insects. Conversely, brachiaria proves to be more susceptible to infestations of Dalbulus maidis (DeLong and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), and Diabrotica speciosa (Germar, 1824) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The study underscores the relevance of the judicious choice of cover crops in IPM and in promoting agricultural biodiversity, creating a strategic tool to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the cotton production system in the context of the NTS.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation, yield, and alternative products in coffee agroecosystems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroecology and conservation must overlap to protect biodiversity and farmer livelihoods. Coffee agroecosystems with complex shade canopies protect biodiversity. Yet, few have examined biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in Asia relative to the Americas and many question whether coffee agroecosystems can play a similar role for conservation. We examined vegetation, ant and bird diversity, coffee yields and revenues, and harvest of alternative products in coffee farms and forests in SW Sumatra, Indonesia near Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBS). BBS is among the last habitats for large mammals in Sumatra and > 15,000 families illegally cultivate coffee inside of BBS. As a basis for informing management recommendations, we compared the conservation potential and economic outputs from farms inside and outside of BBS. Forests had higher canopy cover, canopy depth, tree height, epiphyte loads, and more emergent trees than coffee farms. Coffee farms inside BBS had more epiphytes and trees and fewer coffee plants than farms outside BBS. Tree, ant, and bird richness was significantly greater in forests than in coffee farms, and richness did not differ in coffee farms inside and outside of BBS. Species similarity of forest and coffee trees, ants, and birds was generally low (< 50%). Surprisingly, farms inside the park were significantly older, but farm size, coffee yields, and revenues from coffee did not depend on farm location. Farmers outside BBS received higher prices for their coffee and also more often produced other crops in their coffee fields such that incentives could be created to draw illegal farmers out of the park. We also discuss these results with reference to similar work in Chiapas, Mexico to compare the relative contribution of coffee fields to conservation in the two continents, and discuss implications for working with farmers in Sumatra towards conservation plans incorporating sustainable coffee production.

TI  - Soil and litter fauna of cacao agroforestry systems in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems deposit great amounts of plant residues on soil and this leads to high levels of soil organic matter content and has increased soil biodiversity and improved its conservation. This study compares the distribution of meso and macrofaunal communities in soil and litter under cacao agroforestry systems and in a natural forest in the southern Bahia state of Brazil. Soil and litter samples were obtained in September 2003, February 2004, and August 2004 in five cacao agroforestry systems. The systems evaluated included: cacao renewed under Erythrina sp. (Erythrina poeppigiana) (CRE); cacao renewed under natural forest (Cabruca, CRF); an old cacao system under Erythrina sp. (OCE); an old cacao system under a natural forest system (Cabruca, OCF) and a cacao germplasm collection area (CGC). As a reference soil and litter under a natural forest (NF) was included. Organisms were collected over a 15-day period with a Berlese-Tullgren apparatus. The density and richness of total fauna varied distinctly according to sites, sampling time and material sampled (soil and litter). 16,409 of fauna were recovered from soil and litter samples and the density of total fauna was 2,094 individuals m(-2) in the litter and 641 individuals m(-2) in the soil. The richness was 11.8 in the litter and 7.5 in the soil. The cacao agroforestry systems adopted for growing cacao in the southern Bahia region of Brazil have beneficial effects on the soil and litter faunal communities, and such systems of cacao cultivation could be considered as a conservation system for soil fauna. The development of a litter layer resulted in higher abundance and diversity of soil fauna.

TI  - Mixed-species Groups of Marmosets and Tamarins Across a Gradient of Agroforestry Intensification
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyspecific associations are commonly observed in social animals, including primates, and have been interpreted as adaptations either to improve access to resources or to provide protection against predators. Mixed-species associations between Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii) and golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) have been documented, and are unique among Atlantic forest primates. Both species are endemic to southern Bahia where part of the forest has been converted into cacao agroforests, which have been subjected to management intensification. Tree density and canopy connectivity decrease in more intensively managed agroforests, potentially increasing predation risk and the frequency of mixed-species groups between these primates. Here, we test this hypothesis using a standardized, large spatial-scale data set obtained from camera-trapping in 30 sites across an agroforestry landscape mosaic. As expected, the frequency of mixed-species groups increased in more intensively managed agroforests, but only relative to the total number of records of tamarins. Our results highlight that the benefits of mixed-species groups can be asymmetrical among species and variable across the landscape. They corroborate that predation avoidance is an important advantage of mixed-species groups in callitrichids, especially for conspicuous species living in smaller groups, such as the tamarin. Despite the importance of agroforests to conservation, our results indicate that management intensification can increase predation risk for species of conservation concern. To maintain the conservation value of agroforests, management practices should be planned to avoid any loss of canopy connectivity, taking into account the biodiversity vs. productivity trade-off associated with shade management.

TI  - Organic farm does not improve neither soil, or water quality in rural watersheds from southeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in a rural region where there are conventional and organic farms, the agricultural production includes more than 20 million people, and the effect on environmental quality is still poorly known in terms of indicators. Our objectives were: (1) compare soils attributes to reference areas, (2) verifying if cultivated areas under different farm systems presented differences in the soils attributes, (3) evaluate the attributes of quality water of watersheds and comparing the results with limiting values established by environmental legislation, and (4) analyze the values considering three criterion: watersheds, climatic season, and region of the landscapes. The study was conducted in two rural watersheds that have similar biophysical features and located in the Ibitina municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. However, one watershed encompasses farms where landowners largely use conventional agricultural systems. In the other watershed approximately 25% of the farms there are using an organic farm system. In the two watersheds soil samples were collected in sites covered with natural forest and in sites with agriculture (one watershed being organic and other being conventional). The attributes analyzed were soil bulk density (BD), concentrations of Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N), C:N ratio, C Management Index, and the abundance of C-13 and N-15 in the soil organic matter. Water attributes were analyzed onsite or in laboratory after analysis of samples. Analyses included: air and water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, total of dissolved solids, total solids, electric conductivity, turbidity, total chloride, nitrate, total phosphorus and potassium. Regarding the soil attributes our database revealed that (1) the soils from cultivated sites of both watersheds presented significant differences from their respective forested areas, (2) Soil attributes are of equal quality in both farm systems. Concerning water attributes: (1) almost all attributes presented values better than the limiting values stipulated by Brazilian legislation; (2) the watersheds did not present significant differences of most of the attributes; (3) in the criteria climatic season data showed some significant differences. The data showed that the soils from the areas used for agricultural ends present belief that significantly worse soil quality in comparison to soils from sites still covered with natural forest. Neither the land cover nor farming system are altering the superficial water quality of the studied watershed and this appears to be related to the extensive percentage of natural remaining vegetation that still exists in both watersheds. The seasonality is an important force that drives the quality characteristics of the water. We highlight that the principles of organic agriculture should be practiced more efficiently and influences such as deforestation should be rigorously avoided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ecologically-sustainable tree monocultures contribute to conservation of an Araucaria Forest endemic frog
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree monocultures frequently have a negative impact on biodiversity; however, the adoption of ecologically-sustainable management practices can produce a different outcome. In this study we evaluate how the replacement of Araucaria Forest by ecologically-sustainable monocultures affects the abundance, age structure, sex ratio, and diet of the endemic frog Physalaemus lisei Braun and Braun ( 1977) (Leiuperidae). From October 2003 to April 2005, population samples were taken with pit-fall traps in three 1 ha sites for each of the following habitats: Araucaria Forest, and old monocultures of Araucaria angustifolia, Pinus, and Eucalyptus. The number of individuals captured in Araucaria Forest was similar to that of the monocultures. Population recruitment was higher in the exotic monocultures. Captured individuals were female-biased, the sex ratio being similar for all habitats. Physalaemus lisei was slightly more generalist on the monocultures. These results suggest that the forestry industry, by adopting ecologically-sustainable management practices, can contribute to the conservation of threatened and endemic species.

TI  - DIVERSITY OF MITES (ACARI) IN VINEYARD AGROECOSYSTEMS (VITIS VINIFERA) IN TWO VITICULTURAL REGIONS OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - ACAROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to study mite diversity in vineyard plots planted with Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir cultivars and on associated non-cultivated plants in two viticultural regions of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Monthly assessments of leaves and buds of vines and of non-cultivated plants were undertaken between October 2006 and September 2007. Twelve thousand mites belonging to 17 families and 46 genera and representing 61 mite species were collected. The most abundant phytophagous mites were Calepitrimerus vitis, Colomerus vitis and Panonychus ulmi on grapevines. Among the predatory mites, the most abundant were Neoseiulus californicus and Agistemus floridanus. The non-cultivated plants species that showed the greatest richness of mites were Plantago tomentosa, Plantago lanceolata and Senecio sp. The most abundant phytophagous mites on non-cultivated plants were Tetranychus ludeni and Brevipalpus phoenicis in the viticultural regions of Bento Goncalves and Candiota, respectively, and Pronematus anconai was generally the most abundant predatory mite. In the region of Bento Goncalves, species richness and abundance in the agroecosystem were far higher than in the region of Candiota.

TI  - COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITY AND LEAF LITTER STOCK IN AGRO-FORESTRY SYSTEMS AND SECONDARY FORESTRY
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agro-Forestry Systems (AFS), in addition to being a means of providing income, can be considered an alternative way of helping conserve biodiversity, both above and below ground. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of tree leaf litter and its nutrient content as well as the composition of fauna in the soil-litter layer in two Agro-Forestry Systems (AFS-1 and AFS-2), using as reference an area of secondary Forest (SF), in the Quilombola do Campinho da Independencia community, Paraty, in the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil. The collection of accumulated leaf litter and soil-litter fauna was carried out from four sample points in each area and at two different seasons of the year, the rainy and the dry season. The leaf litter stock and its nutrient content (Ca, Mg, P, K and N) were measured. The extraction of fauna was carried out according to Tullgren's method, modifying the Berlese funnel. The stock of accumulated leaf litter differed between the two areas only in the rainy season; the amounts were smaller in AFS-2. In general, the Agro-Forestry Systems were very similar to the secondary forest in terms of levels and/or stock of nutrients in the majority of cases, at least in one of the seasons studied. The composition of the soil fauna groups in the Agro-Forestry System (AFS-1 and AFS-2) had a high degree of similarity to that found in the forest, and these systems mainly favour the populations of groups like Collembola and Formicidae.

T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the fire reports occurring in the Itatiaia National Park (INP) between 1937 and 2008 and aiming to show information about the total number of fires occurred, and the annual burnt areas, in relation with climate and biodiversity, the months of highest occurrence, the origins and causes of fires. A survey of 323 reports of forest fires showed the highest incidence of forest fires in the months of winter, during the dry season, between July and October. The most affected vegetation was that of the "campos de altitude" (high-altitude grasslands), a native ecosystem of Atlantic Rainforest restricted to the isolated southeastern high peaks and plateaus. Most of the fires had unknown origins and causes, and only twice were examinations by experts carried out. Data revealed INP fragility against forest fires and the importance and the need of Forest Fire Privation and Control Plans for effective biodiversity protection.

TI  - Soil toxicity in a protected area in Brazil: Cytotoxic, genotoxic, and toxic effects
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Campos de Palmas Wildlife Refuge (CPWR) (Brazil) is a full protection Conservation Unit (CU) formed by private properties, where the use of land and natural resources are allowed sustainably according to the rules of the CU Management Plan. Inadequate practices of land use and occupation within this CU can affect its quality and the organ-isms that depend on them. Considering the above, the objective of the present study was to biomonitor different land uses and occupations within the CPWR and its surroundings, during the four seasons of a year, using the bioindicators Allium cepa (cytotoxicity and genotoxicity tests) and Eisenia fetida (leakage test). The soil samples were collected in areas of silviculture, agriculture, and native grasslands within the CU and agriculture outside the limits of the CPWR. The use by silviculture (spring) and native grassland (summer) showed cytotoxic effects for A. cepa. The use by agriculture outside the CPWR (spring) showed genotoxic effect and stimulation of mitotic cell division. For the an-imal bioindicator, the use by agriculture within the CPWR (winter), native grassland (autumn and spring), silviculture (autumn and spring), and agriculture outside the CU (spring) showed a toxic effect. A PCA analysis showed a correlation between the results of toxicity, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity with the presence of macronutrients and metals in the evaluated soil samples. Possibly influenced by their soil composition characteristics (silviculture and na-tive grassland) or the management of agricultural areas. In addition, samples from the rainy season (spring) showed higher ecotoxicity. These results show that biomonitoring through different organisms is important for evaluating en-vironmental quality and indicate the need for the implementation of preventive measures in the CPWR to avoid the toxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects found. They also ensure the integrity of this CU and the active protection of the environment and biodiversity.

TI  - Does the local availability of woody Caatinga plants (northeastern Brazil) explain their use value?
T2  - ECONOMIC BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the use of woody plants by a rural community in an area of dry land Caatinga vegetation in northeastern Brazil. Information was obtained concerning this woody species with a diameter that is equal to or greater than 3 centimeters (cm) at soil level surveyed in 100 sample plots totaling 1 hectare (ha). The following question is the hypothesis we tested. Is a plant's relative importance (as measured by its use value) related to its "apparency," as measured by its abundance and ecological dominance? "Apparency" explains the use value of plants in four categories: medicinal, construction, fuel, and technology. The most important uses of woody plants are related to harvesting for energy and construction purposes.

T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to elucidate population fluctuations of spider and ant species in forest fragments and adjacent soybean and corn crops under no-tillage and conventional tillage systems, and their correlations with meteorological factors. From Nov 2004 to Apr 2007 sampling of these arthropods at Guaira, Sao Paulo state was done biweekly during the cropping season and monthly during the periods between crops. To obtain samples at each experimental site, pitfall traps were distributed in 2 transects of 200 m of which 100 m was in the crop, and 100 m was in the forest fragment. Temperature and rainfall were found to have major impacts on fluctuations in population densities of ants of the genus, Pheidole, in soybean and corn crops both grown with conventional tillage and no tillage systems.

TI  - Soil organic carbon stock and litter mass in silvopastoral systems with Eucalyptus
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil organic carbon stock and litter mass in silvopastoral systems (SSP) implemented with Urochloa decumbens and different Eucalyptus spatial arrangements. The SSP was implemented in 2008 with the spatial arrangements of (3 x 2) + 20 m (434 trees ha(-1)), (2 x 2) + 9 m (909 trees ha(-1)) and 9 x 2 m (556 trees ha(-1)) formed by the Eucalyptus cultivars GG100, I144 and VM 58. Soil samples at 0 to 20 and 0 to 40 cm depths were collected in SSP in 2011 and 2015 to determine soil organic carbon stock. The soil organic carbon stock was 38.5% higher in 2015 compared to 2011 (111 vs. 80.7 Mg ha(-1)), which represented an annual sink of 6.22 Mg ha(-1) and indicates an increase in carbon stock over years. Litter mass was greater under the canopy than between trees, probably due to the greater drop in biomass in this location. The silvopastoral systems showed similar volumes of litter and soil organic carbon, which indicates that the evaluated arrangements have similar capacities to store carbon.

TI  - Cabruca agroforests in southern Bahia, Brazil: tree component, management practices and tree species conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Bahia, Brazil, cabrucas are the traditional agroforests in which cacao trees are planted under thinned-out native forests. To analyze the role of cabrucas in tree species conservation, we inventoried the non-cocoa trees in 1.0 ha plots of cabruca in 16 cocoa farms and compared our results with a similar survey undertaken in the early 1960s in the same region to analyze the long term changes. We also interviewed 160 cocoa farmers to investigate their preferences for species and the main practices used in managing shade trees. The cabrucas showed high levels of tree diversity for an agroforestry system (Shannon index ranging from 2.21 to 3.52) and also high variation in structure and composition among the different farms. Forest specialist trees accounted for most species (63.9%) in the survey and were among the species most preferred by the farmers, although we found evidence that some of these trees are gradually being replaced by other species. Our results indicate that cabrucas are poor substitutes for undisturbed forests in terms of tree species richness, but their presence in human-altered landscapes is of utmost importance to the conservation of forest tree species as they increase overall heterogeneity and may serve as ecological corridors, additional habitats, and buffer zones.

TI  - Soil attributes under different crop management systems in an Amazon Oxisols
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil biological properties have a high potential for use in assessing the impacts of crop systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of cropping systems on the biological attributes of an oxisol in the Amazonian state of Para. The treatments consisted of approximately 20-year-old secondary vegetation, recovered pasture, no-tillage systems (NT) maintained for 4 and 8 years after planting with corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.), and conventional tillage (CT) systems every 2 years after planting with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and soybean. The microbial biomass to nitrogen ratio was higher in the NT system (0.68 mg kg(-1)), and the NT system had greater microbial NT8. Thus, the contributions of organic matter from straw improved the soil quality in these areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) content was greater in the secondary forest and CT areas (46.7 and 48.0 mg kg(-1), respectively), potentially due to the higher amounts of organic matter and organic matter mineralization in these areas. However, the largest TOC stocks were observed in the pasture, which corresponded with greater carbon storage (63.5 Mg ha(-1)). By contrast, the no-till systems were not efficient for storing C, with concentrations of 5.0 and 5.3 Mg ha(-1) in NT-4 and NT-8, respectively. These results may reflect the short period that these systems were adopted and the vast microbial activity that was observed in these areas, with microbial quotients of 8.03 and 10.41% in NT-4 and NT-8, respectively.

This condition have impacted to food insecurity of the community that reside in watershed area. This study aim to formulate adaptive agroforestry model to increase farmer livelihood in supporting watershed management. Population study i.e. all of the farmer household in Minraleng Hulu Watershed. Study sampling was done by purposive sampling in 4 sampling village (Limampoccoe, Cenrana Baru, Timpuseng and Batu Putih). Data collection was done by in-depth interview and observation. Data was analyzed by qualitative descriptive and spatial analysis. Result of the study indicated that combination pattern of landscape agroforestry model need to be developed in dry land and the big property land in Cenrana Baru, Limampoccoe and Batu Putih. That agroforestry model known by Taungya by developing adaptive plant to drought and give livelihood diversification and adaptive to the short rainy season, secure from pest i.e. swine, monkey, and cow. In Timpuseng village, agroforestry pattern need to be was permanent intensive agroforestry which is known by Talun where farmer need to develop three to fourth strata of plant to resolve limited land by planting gamal tress and candlenut in the top of the strata, while planting coffee and pepper in second strata, and chili and elephant grass in third strata.

TI  - A whole-ecosystem method for experimentally suppressing ants on a small scale
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ant suppression experiments have emerged as a powerful method for assessing the role of ants in ecosystems. However, traditional methods have been limited to canopy ants, and not assessed the role of ants on and below ground. Recent advances have enabled whole-ecosystem ant suppression in large plots, but large-scale experiments are not always feasible. Here, we develop a small-scale, whole-ecosystem suppression method. We compare techniques for monitoring suppression experiments, and assess whether habitat complexity in oil palm influences our method's effectiveness. We conducted ant suppression experiments in oil palm agroforestry in Sumatra, Indonesia. We used targeted poison baits, a physical barrier and canopy isolation to suppress ants in 4 m radius arenas around single palms. We sequentially tested three suppression methods that increased in intensity over 18 months. We sampled ant abundance before and after suppression by fogging, using pitfall traps and extracting soil monoliths. We also monitored ants throughout the experiment by baiting. We tested the soil for residual poison and monitored other invertebrates (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Chilopoda) to test for cross-contamination. Plots were established under four oil palm management treatments that varied in their habitat complexity: reduced, intermediate and high understorey complexity treatments in mature plantation, and a recently replanted plantation. Post-treatment ant abundance was 92% lower in suppression than control plots. Only the most intensive suppression method, which ran for the final 9 months, worked. Baiting rarely reflected the other monitoring methods. The treatment negatively affected Orthoptera, but not other taxa. There was no residual poison in the soil. Coleoptera abundance increased in suppression plots post-treatment, potentially due to reduced competition with ants. Our findings were consistent across management treatments. We developed a whole-ecosystem method for suppressing ants on a small scale in oil palm plantations. Our method represents a significant advance; previous reductions in ant abundance have not exceeded 38%. We provide the first example of ants being experimentally suppressed belowground. Baiting alone is not adequate for assessing suppression effectiveness, and testing a range of taxa for confounding impacts is important. Our study can act as a blueprint for developing suppression methods for other taxa, which offer unique insights into community ecology.

TI  - Diversity of bird species in the coffee agroforestry landscape: Case study in the Pangalengan Sub-district, Bandung District, West Java, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, shade-grown coffee agroforestry is home to diverse taxa, including insects and mammals. However, research has shown that shade-grown coffee agroforestry is also an important habitat for various types of birds. A study on the diversity of bird species was performed in the coffee agroforestry landscape area of Perum Perhutani, Pangalengan Sub-district, Bandung District, West Java. Bird diversity data was collected using the point count method, and landscape structure analysis was performed, to quantify the characteristics of the landscape. The results were analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis to determine the relationships between landscape structures and bird species diversity. The results of the study recorded 60 species of birds, from 29 families, among 1,581 individuals. The most dominant bird species were Pycnonotus aurigaster, Orthotomus sutorius, Orthotomus ruficeps, Streptopelia chinensis, and Brachypteryx leucophrys. The highest species abundance value at the research site was recorded for Pycnonotus aurigaster, with a relative abundance value of 22.02%. The diversity of bird species found at the study location was classified as high (H ' = 3.10). Thus, coffee agroforestry landscapes are associated with bird diversity, and diversity appears to increase when the total area (TA) increases; however the patch edge length (TE), number of spots (NP), the complexity of patch forms (MSI, MPFD) and landscape heterogeneity (SHDI) decrease. The coffee agroforestry landscape may represent an important habitat for many bird species.

TI  - Human land-uses homogenize stream assemblages and reduce animal biomass production
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Human land-use change is a major threat to natural ecosystems worldwide. Nonetheless, the effects of human land-uses on the structure of plant and animal assemblages and their functional characteristics need to be better understood. Furthermore, the pathways by which human land uses affect ecosystem functions, such as biomass production, still need to be clarified.2. We compiled a unique dataset of fish, arthropod and macrophyte assemblages from 61 stream ecosystems in two Neotropical biomes: Amazonian rainforest and Uruguayan grasslands. We then tested how the cover of agriculture, pasture, urbanization and afforestation affected the taxonomic richness and functional diversity of those three species assemblages, and the consequences of these effects for animal biomass production. Single trait categories and functional diversity were evaluated, combining recruitment and life-history, resource and habitat-use, and body size.3. The effects of intensive human land-uses on taxonomic and functional diversities were as strong as other drivers known to affect biodiversity, such as local climate and environmental factors. In both biomes, the taxonomic richness and functional diversity of animal and macrophyte assemblages decreased with increasing cover of agriculture, pasture, and urbanization. Human land-uses were associated with functional homogenization of both animal and macrophyte assemblages. Human land-uses reduced animal biomass through direct and indirect pathways mediated by declines in taxonomic and functional diversities.4. Our findings indicate that converting natural ecosystems to supply human demands results in species loss and trait homogenization across multiple biotic assemblages, ultimately reducing animal biomass production in streams.

TI  - Soil biochemistry and microbial activity in vineyards under conventional and organic management at Northeast Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sao Francisco Submedium Valley is located at the Brazilian semiarid region and is an important center for irrigated fruit growing. This region is responsible for 97% of the national exportation of table grapes, including seedless grapes. Based on the fact that organic fertilization can improve soil quality, we compared the effects of conventional and organic soil management on microbial activity and mycorrhization of seedless grape crops. We measured glomerospores number, most probable number (MPN) of propagules, richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species, AMF root colonization, EE-BRSP production, carbon microbial biomass (C-MB), microbial respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity (FDA) and metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)). The organic management led to an increase in all variables with the exception of EE-BRSP and qCO(2). Mycorrhizal colonization increased from 4.7% in conventional crops to 15.9% in organic crops. Spore number ranged from 4.1 to 12.4 per 50 g(-1) soil in both management systems. The most probable number of AMF propagules increased from 79 cm(-3) soil in the conventional system to 110 cm(-3) soil in the organic system. Microbial carbon, CO2 emission, and FDA activity were increased by 100 to 200% in the organic crop. Thirteen species of AMF were identified, the majority in the organic cultivation system. Acaulospora excavata, Entrophospora infrequens, Glomus sp.3 and Scutellospora sp. were found only in the organically managed crop. S. gregaria was found only in the conventional crop. Organically managed vineyards increased mycorrhization and general soil microbial activity.

AB  - Although selectively logged tropical forests have high bird species richness, it is known that their species composition is substantially changed when compared with intact forests. Thus, we need to improve the under-standing on how functional trait diversity of birds is affected in this habitat type in order to support the development of more effective conservation actions to maintain functional roles and community stability. Here, we evaluate traits responses to variations in forest vegetation integrity and how the pattern of niche occupancy is affected by this increase in species richness. We then evaluated the effects of vegetation integrity in the Atlantic rainforest on range of trait space occupied, niche packing, and trait composition in local bird communities. We also evaluate the mechanisms driving niche expansion and packing using null models. Our results show that trait composition changes in communities: (1) lower vegetation integrity increases foraging in understory and con-sumption of grains and ectothermic vertebrates by birds; (2) higher vegetation integrity drives higher and wider beaks and increase foraging for invertebrates in canopy. We also found that lower vegetation integrity not only is associated with the increase of species richness, but also with both expansion and packing of niche space occupied by the community. However, only niche packing had predominantly smaller values than expected by chance, indicating a strong effect of environmental filters on niche occupancy density. Although bird assem-blages in more intact vegetations have lower species richness, they have greater functional distance between bird species suggesting greater stability, with a low probability of local extinctions due to a lower intensity of interspecific competition. This demonstrates that isolated assessments of species richness are potentially illusory and can lead to unsuccessful conservation measures, such as proposing selective logging in primary forests based on the supposed benefit of increased bird species richness in vegetations less intact. Furthermore, the functional composition tends to change with changes in vegetation integrity degree, thus altering the functional role pro-vided by communities. Consequently, forests with high vegetation integrity status should be maintained, despite the lower species richness.

TI  - Richness and distribution of useful woody plants in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The species richness and distribution of useful plants in the semi-arid caatinga vegetation of northeastern Brazil was evaluated based on 20 phytosociological surveys conducted over a period of 36 years. Precipitation and altitude were analyzed as possible predictors of species richness. A total of 43 families, 130 genera, and 225 species were cataloged. The family Euphorbiaceae had the highest richness (34 species), with the genus Croton comprising I I species. In terms of the distribution of species, four species were found to be widely distributed, 33 demonstrated intermediate distribution, and 188 were of restricted distribution. Of all the species recorded, 122 were considered useful. The main use-categories were: wood for construction (86 species) and medicinal plants (80). The plant with the greatest number of recorded uses was Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. There was no significant correlation observed between precipitation and the species richness of useful or non-useful plants; however, a correlation was observed in terms of total richness, despite the existence of a nonlinear increment in species richness along the precipitation gradient. Similarly, there was no significant correlation between altitude and either total plant or useful plant richness but, interestingly, there was a significant relationship of this nature observed with non-useful plants. As such, the richness of useful plants in the caatinga seems to be a function of general biodiversity and it is not directly linked to the ecological factors examined (precipitation and altitude).

TI  - Woody species richness in the Brazilian atlantic forest, state of Sao Paulo (Brazil)
T2  - Revista Brasileira de Botanica
M3  - Article
AB  - The atlantic forest in Sao Paulo state, has been described in the scientific literature as having high floristic diversity. Such statement is based on data and conclusions of local floristic and phytosociological studies. However, the studies supporting this idea seldom give a clear definition of the plant group analysed, the scale of the study, nor, most significantly, the forests used for comparisons. Here we compare woody species richness data (gtoreq 2.5 cm dbh) from the atlantic forest in Sao Paulo to similar data from other neotropical forests. Thereafter, we discuss the major relationships between historical and ecological processes and woody species richness in neotropical forests. Neither data on woody species richness nor characteristics of latitude, altitude, rainfall and soil in the atlantic region is able to support the idea high woody species richness in the Sao Paulo atlantic forest. Studies using comparable data sets are required in order to characterise woody species richness in all types of the atlantic forest, as well as to suggest the mechanisms responsible for plant richness in different scales.

AB  - Peatland forest in the Kampar peninsula have converted into various land uses, mainly converted to palm oil plantation. The massive conversion has decreased biodiversity, changed the hydrological cycle, and increased the peatland fire that dramatically decreased the quality of the peatland ecosystem. It is essential to understand the peatland characteristics and its hydrological cycle to develop sustainable peatland management. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of peat soil and the response of groundwater level to rainfall on burned peatland, mixed plantation and primary peat swamp forests in Siak district. The study was conducted from July to December 2018 by using a hydrometeorological station equipped with rainfall and groundwater level sensors. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were analyzed to identify the soil characteristics. The response of groundwater level to rainfall was analyzed using simple regression. The results showed that the burned peatland and mixed plantation have increased bulk density, decreased soil porosity, and caused a decrease of water infiltration. Simple regression analysis between the rainfall and the increase of GWL on the primary peat swamp forest resulted in 0.941 (P)(0.5106) and an R-2 value 0.6189, meanwhile on the burned peatland resulted in 1.2127(P)(0.7818) and an R-2 value 0.8616, and on the mixed resulted 0.7455 in (P)(0.7831) and an R-2 = 0.7557.

TI  - Assessing soil erosion and its drivers in agricultural landscapes: a case study in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion is a worldwide threat to biodiversity conservation and agricultural yield, and it is linked to deforestation. In this study, we aim to assess soil loss in landscapes of the Cachoeira River watershed, in southern Bahia, northeastern Brazil. We estimate the role of forests in diminishing soil erosion using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). We compare real and simulated scenarios in which the forest was replaced by agricultural use, also comparing estimates of erosivity factor (R factor) derived from remote sensing and climatological station data. Real and simulated annual soil losses varied from 0 to 167.87 t/year and from 0 to 351.81 t/year along the watershed, respectively. However, only 0.04 and 1.67% of this area is highly and severely exposed to erosion, using data from climatological stations and remote sensing, respectively. We showed that soil loss in the simulated deforested scenario was approximately two times higher than the real annual soil loss, indicating the importance of forest cover to mitigate soil erosion. Moreover, soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. Conclusively, the practice of agroforestry can be used as an alternative to avoid erosion. HIGHLIGHTS center dot This paper assessed soil erosion in an important river in Brazil. center dot Real and simulated scenarios of soil loss were discussed in this study. center dot Soil loss was 10.5 times greater when using precipitation data from remote sensing compared to climatological stations. center dot Soil loss is twice as high in non-forested areas as in forested areas.

TI  - Qualitative and quantitative changes in soil microbiota and biological nitrogen fixation under different soybean managements
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, quantitative and qualitative microbiological parameters were evaluated to detect differences related to soil and crop management. The study was carried out in a field experiment installed 14 years ago on a Rhodic Eutrudox, in Londrina, PR, Brazil. Treatments were a combination of a crop sequence (S) (soybean/wheat) and a crop rotation (R) (lupin/maize/black oat/soybean/wheat/soybean/wheat/soybean), either under conventional tillage (CT) or no-tillage (NT). Evaluations were performed when all systems were under the soybean cropping season, at full flowering. Amounts of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MB-C and MB-N, respectively) were 114 and 157% higher in NT than in CT. Furthermore, the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) was lower under NT, indicating higher metabolic efficiency of the soil microbes. These parameters were not affected by the crop sequence/rotation. Genetic diversity of the total soil bacterial community was higher under NT and lower in the CT system with crop sequence. Regarding the biological N-2 fixation, it was found that plant biomass, total N and fraction of N-ureides in shoots, as well as nodule efficiency, were higher under NT. Genetic diversity of rhizobia was affected mainly by crop management and was higher under crop rotation, probably due to the greater number of plant species. However, crop rotation decreased the efficiency of the biological N-2 fixation process, which may be related to more abundant N in the soil or to a lower selection pressure for efficient rhizobia. For soil microbes with specific functions, e.g., rhizobia, genetic diversity may therefore differ from functionality.

AB  - Land conflicts at Solok Buntu Resort, Berbak-Sembilang National Park (BSNP), have occurred since 1995. Land conflicts occur due to the encroachment of forest areas by the community for fish farming. Farm activities do not only damage their natural vegetation but also increase pressure upon the wildlife in the area. This study aims to find the best solution to resolve community land conflicts at Solok Buntu Resort. The study was conducted in December 2018 using qualitative methods. Field observations combined with a household interview and community discussions were conducted to examine opportunities for harmonizing between the interests of access to farm management with ecosystem sustainability based on the principles of justice, prosperity and sustainability. The results showed that migrants dominated the majority of the occupation from Lampung Province. Easy access, lack of public awareness, and economic needs had become the triggering factors of land occupation at Solok Buntu Resort. Two strategies can be done to resolve the conflict. The first is to move the community from the forest area (resettlement) to their original villages. The second is to establish collaboration between B SNP with the community to restore the conservation area.

TI  - Rapid assessment methods of resilience for natural and agricultural systems
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The resilience, ecological function and quality of both agricultural and natural systems were evaluated in the mountainous region of the Atlantic Rain Forest of Rio de Janeiro through Rapid Assessment Methods. For this goal new indicators were proposed, such as eco-volume, eco-height, bio-volume, volume efficiency, and resilience index. The following agricultural and natural systems have been compared according: (i) vegetables (leaf, fruit and mixed); (ii) citrus; (iii) ecological system; (iv) cattle, (v) silvo-pastoral system, (vi) forest fragment and (vii) forest in regeneration stage (1, 2 and 3 years old). An alternative measure (index) of resilience was proposed by considering the actual bio-volume as a function of the potential eco-volume. The objectives and hypotheses were fulfilled; it is shown that there does exist a high positive correlation between resilience index, biomass, energy efficiency and biodiversity. Cattle and vegetable systems have lowest resilience, whilst ecological and silvo-pastoral systems have greatest resilience. This new approach offers a rapid, though valuable assessment tool for ecological studies, agricultural development and landscape planning, particularly in tropical countries.

TI  - Soil organic carbon fraction losses upon continuous plow-based tillage and its restoration by diverse biomass-C inputs under no-till in sub-tropical and tropical regions of Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of native vegetation (NV) into agricultural land by clearing and tillage disrupts the soil structure, and depletes soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. The data on changes in SOC pools are needed to enhance scientific knowledge regarding the effects of land use and no-till (NT) systems on soil fertility, agronomic productivity, and soil C sink capacity. Thus, the objective of this study was to quantify changes in SOC fractions due to conversion of NV to agricultural land, and to assess the rate of recovery of SOC fractions and the resilience index of NT cropping systems under sub-tropical (Ponta Grossa/PR - PG) and tropical (Lucas do Rio Verde/MT - LRV) regions of Brazil. The conversion from CT to NT was 29 and 8 years at the PG and LRV sites, respectively. Five different fractions of SOC pools were extracted by chemical methods (i.e., C in the polysaccharides - CTPS, hot-water extractable C - HWEOC, chemically-stabilized organic C - CSOC), and physical fractionation (i.e., particulate organic C - POC, and mineral-associated organic C - MAOC). Land use change primarily altered the labile (HWEOC, TPS, and POC) and also some of the stable (MAOC) pools at both sites. The CSOC pool was almost constant throughout the soil profile and represented, across land uses, 7.2 g C kg(-1) at the PG and 3.1 g C kg(-1) at the LRV sites. At the PG site, the HWEOC and CUPS concentrations in the 0-5 cm depth decreased by 56% (1.21 g kg(-1)) and 45% (7.21 g kg(-1)) in CT soil, respectively. At the LRV site, concentrations of HWEOC and CTPS in the 0-5 cm depth decreased by 50% (0.4 g kg(-1)) and 42% (4.8 g kg(-1)), respectively. In contrast, concentrations of HWEOC and CTPS fractions in soil under NT in the 0-20 cm depth were closer than those under NV, and exhibited a distinct gradient from surface to sub-soil layers. The adoption of CT reduced POC by 46% (4.7 Mg ha(-1)), and MAOC by 21% (15.1 Mg C ha(-1)) in the 0-20 cm depth at the PG site. Using CT for 23 years at the LRV site, decreased SOC fractions in the 0-20 cm depth at the rate of 0.25 and 034 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for POC and MAOC, respectively. In contrast, adoption of intensive NT systems in tropical agro-ecoregions increased POC at the rate of 0.23 to 0.36 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), and MAOC by 0.52 and 0.70 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). An important effect to be emphasized is the possibility of recovering, at least partially, the SOC fractions by adopting high biomass-C inputs under NT management, and despite the fact that the experimental duration at the LRV site was only eight years. With a high and diversified input of biomass-C in intensive NT systems, higher resilience index was observed for CTPS, HWEOC, and MAOC. The variation in SOC among CT and NT systems was mainly attributed to the MAOC fraction, indicating that a significant proportion of that fraction is relatively labile, and that spatial inaccessibility of SOC plays a significant role in the restoration of SOC.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical landscapes are dominated by land-use systems, but their contribution to the conservation of biodiversity is largely unknown. Since changes in biodiversity in response to human impact are known to differ widely among taxonomic groups and guilds there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate experts. We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops. As expected, overall species richness tended to decrease within this gradient of increasing habitat modification, but, in contrast to previous studies, we found the species richness between most taxonomic groups to be significantly correlated (36 out of 38 pairwise comparisons). However, on average only 48% of the variance could be explained (within the five main groups), and only a few taxonomic groups/guilds turned out to be good predictors for others: for example, trees for fruit- and nectar-feeding birds (88% explanation) and fruit-feeding butterflies (83%), endemic birds for endemic butterflies (72%), and frugivorous/nectar-feeding birds for fruit-feeding butterflies (67%). Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification. Near-primary forest sites proved to be of principal importance for conservation; however, land-use systems such as secondary forests (for understory plants, birds, and butterflies) and agroforestry systems (for butterflies) supported relatively high numbers of species and might play a significant role for biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes.

AB  - By 2010, Sumatera Island of Indonesia had lost the highest annual forest cover due to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) expansion, leading to adverse environmental impacts. The introduction of oil palm agroforestry (OPAF) within the social forestry program was to reduce these environmental impacts, conserve biodiversity, enhance wildlife habitat, and improve smallholder household resilience. However, the information on OPAF implementation progress and its benefits and ecological impacts still need to be explored. This research aims to measure the diversity of birds in young OPAF by comparing birds' diversity in four land covers: young oil palm agroforestry (three years after establishment), old oil palm agroforestry (20 years after establishment), oil palm monoculture, and secondary forest. We indicated 43 bird species from 25 families across all land covers. The secondary forest had the highest valueof bird diversity index value of 2.80. The second was the first young oil palm agroforestry (2.42), followed by old OPAF, oil palm monoculture, and the second young OPAF with index values of 2.30, 2.19, and 2.16, respectively. Enrichment planting on oil palm monoculture through OPAF development could help restore tropical forests' structural complexity while also providing more suitable bird habitats.

TI  - Recovery of species richness and conservation of native Atlantic forest trees in the cacao plantations of southern Bahia in Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation ( age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3- ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment ( r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness ( Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal and soil microbial communities in African Dark Earths
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The socio-economic values of fertile and carbon-rich Dark Earth soils are well described from the Amazon region. Very recently, Dark Earth soils were also identified in tropical West Africa, with comparable beneficial soil properties and plant growth-promoting effects. The impact of this management technique on soil microbial communities, however, is less well understood, especially with respect to the ecologically relevant group of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that (1) improved soil quality in African Dark Earth (AfDE) will increase soil microbial biomass and shift community composition and (2) concurrently increased nutrient availability will negatively affect AM fungal communities. Microbial communities were distinct in AfDE in comparison to adjacent sites, with an increased fungal: bacterial ratio of 71%, a pattern mainly related to shifts in pH. AM fungal abundance and diversity, however, did not differ despite clearly increased soil fertility in AfDE, with 3.7 and 1.7 times greater extractable P and total N content, respectively. The absence of detrimental effects on AM fungi, often seen following applications of inorganic fertilizers, and the enhanced role of saprobic fungi relevant for mineralization and C sequestration support previous assertions of this management type as a sustainable alternative agricultural practice.

TI  - Endophitic fungi diversity in Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) MacLeish
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to verify the presence of endophitic fungi in Eremanthus erythropappus, (DC.) Macleish. This tree species is an important plant of the Savannah of Brazil possessing a great economical potential, mainly, in the production of essential oils. The study was conducted in the Park of Boqueirao, with a total area of 160 ha, located in Ingai-MG, at 21 degrees 14' 59'' of latitude South and 44 degrees 59' 27" of longitude West. It was observed that this species is colonized by endophitic fungi and that there is a significant difference in the degree of colonization in the different samples analyzed. In relation to the colonization, it was observed that Xylaria and Phomopsis were found in all organs sampled. The genera Alternaria and Fusarium demonstrated specificity in seed: Nigrospora and Aspergillus in leaf and Dothiorella in stem. The curves of accumulation of species for leaf and stem followed a similar pattern, showing a slow accumulation of species along the sampling, indicating that a larger sampling could result in a significant increment of new taxons.

TI  - Deforestation narrows pollen diet diversity of generalist orchid bees
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Orchid bee species are important pollinators in the Neotropics. While male orchid bees are known to have a close interaction with odor-rewarding flowers, orchid bee females are often pollen generalists. In the current study, we investigated differences in the pollen diet diversity of orchid bees in various vegetation types and across sites with varying levels of forest cover by means of an analysis of the frass pellets of the orchid bee, Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus, 1758), and multiple species based on a literature review. The pollen grains found in the inner part of brood cells were used to assess the plant composition making up the diet of E. cordata in various areas of the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. We found that this plant composition differed among vegetation types, and that diet specialization was lower in forested areas. Forest cover appeared to be the factor mostly associated with pollen richness in nests of E. cordata. Number of brood cells per nest were also associated with forest cover. The model used to assess the effect of forest cover on plant richness as part of brood diet of E. cordata was tested with the inclusion of published data and a newly generated data for E. annectans. This new data set allowed to understand the influence of forest in the pollen diet of multiple species in a more extensive geographic scale. Forest cover appeared to be important for a diversified pollen diet in several orchid bee species.Implications for insect conservation Since a diversified pollen diet offered to larva bees is associated with bee survival and health, our results indicate that orchid bees relying on areas with higher forest cover have a more resilient population. Such findings emphasize the importance of conservation of forests, especially in the Neotropical region where many pollinator species are adapted to continuous forest environments.

CL  - ICEM Comm, ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Involving the community is one of the initiatives to promote the national achievement of emission reduction targets. Social forestry with agroforestry systems can establish in the forestry sector to help reduce carbon emissions. In the Forest Area with Special Purpose (KHDTK) Rarung in Central Lombok, carbon storage calculations have been performed for various agroforestry patterns created in partnership. The carbon storage analysis was carried out in four agroforestry patterns: coffee, vanilla, bamboo, and annual crops. The carbon stock of each agroforestry pattern was measured three times on a 20 x 20 m(2) plot. The three carbon pools examined were soil, vegetation, litter, and understory carbon. The results showed that a partnership agroforestry pattern is a form of carbon farming that can be widely developed. The bamboo agroforestry pattern has enormous potential for carbon storage.

TI  - Alpha and beta diversity of plants and animals along a tropical land-use gradient
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists. Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of alpha diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on beta diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance beta diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared alpha and beta diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 13-17% of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 12-18% of the variance of beta diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76% for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of alpha diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for beta diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of alpha diversity for beta diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (7-20%) and virtually nil between them (0-4%). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of alpha diversity and that patterns of beta diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of beta diversity shaping overall diversity patterns.

TI  - LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IN THE NORTHERN COAST OF PARANA STATE, A HOTSPOT FOR THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST CONSERVATION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Serra do Mar" region comprises the largest remnant of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The coast of the Parana State is part of the core area of the "Serra do Mar" corridor and where actions for biodiversity conservation must be planned. In this study we aimed at characterizing the landscape structure in the APA-Guaraquecaba, the largest protected area in this region, in order to assist environmental policies of this region. Based on a supervised classification of a mosaic of LANDSAT-5-TM satellite images (from March 2009), we developed a map (1:75,000 scale) with seven classes of land use and land cover and analyzed the relative quantities of forests and modified areas in slopes and lowlands. The APA-Guaraquecaba is comprised mainly by the Dense Ombrophilous Forest (68.6% of total area) and secondary forests (9.1%), indicating a forested landscape matrix; anthropogenic and bare soil areas (0.8%) and the Pasture/Grasslands class (4.2%) were less representative. Slopes were less fragmented and more preserved (96.3% of Dense Ombrophilous Forest and secondary forest) than lowlands (71.3%), suggesting that restoration initiatives in the lowlands must be stimulated in this region. We concluded that most of the region sustains well-conserved ecosystems, highlighting the importance of Parana northern coast for the biodiversity maintenance of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - EFFECTS OF USE OF THE FAXINAL SYSTEM ON FLORISTIC COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE IN TWO AREAS OF MIXED OMBROPHILOUS FOREST IN THE CITY OF REBOUCAS/PR - BRAZIL
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural range of the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF) is located in the southern Brazilian highlands. The Mixed Ombrophilous Forest is characterized by the presence of Faxinal People, who live in Caboclo communities, characterized by their community life. This study aimed to analyze and compare the floristic diversity, the horizontal structure and diametric distribution of the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF) in Faxinal System in localities of Marmeleiro de Baixo and Marmeleiro de Cima, situated in the city of Reboucas/PR - Brazil. Thus, two permanent sampling units were installed, employing an area of 1 HA (100 m x 100 m each), where all trees with DBH (diameter at breast height) exceeding 10 cm were measured. In Faxinal Marmeleiro de Baixo, 352 individuals were inventoried, belonging to 36 species, 24 genera, distributed in 16 families, whereas in Faxinal Marmeleiro de Cima, 445 individuals were inventoried, pertaining to 22 species, 18 genera, distributed in 11 families. The species with highest importance value in Faxinal Marmeleiro de Baixo were Mosiera prismatica (26.46%) and Campomanesia xanthocarpa (7.67%), while in Faxinal Marmeleiro de Cima they were Casearia obliqua (28.59%) and Capsicodendron dinisii (13.27%). Taking into account the results of this study, it can be concluded that historical (phytophisiognomy) and ecological factors (the area of the fragments and the occurrence of anthropic disturbances) represent important elements that characterize the composition and richness of species in forest fragments using the forest under a Faxinal System.

CP  - Global Workshop on Bringing the Landscape into Focus
CL  - Chiang Mai, THAILAND
AB  - Large mammal populations theoretically are best conserved in landscapes where large protected areas are surrounded by buffer zones, connected by corridors, and integrated into a greater ecosystem. Multi-use buffer zones, including those containing complex agroforestry systems, are promoted as one strategy to provide both economic benefits to people and conservation benefits to wildlife. We use the island of Sumatra, Indonesia to explore the benefits and limitations of this strategy. We conclude that conservation benefits are accrued by expanding the habitat available for large mammals but more attention needs to be focused on how to reduce and respond to human-wildlife conflict that is likely to occur in these multiple use areas. Agroforestry systems are likely to play an increasingly valuable role in the conservation of large mammalian species. We believe this value can be increased still further if the agroforestry community decides to assume a leadership role in addressing the issue of human-wildlife conflict, which is fast becoming a central threat to the survival of many large endangered species like tigers and elephants. Both people and wildlife can benefit enormously if appropriate methods are developed to more rigorously define the distribution and frequency of conflict between tigers and elephants with people along the edge of protected areas. Sharp forest-agriculture boundaries may reduce figer-human conflicts, but not elephant-human conflict according to the data we currently have. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon stocks and footprints of smallholder cacao systems in Polewali Mandar, West Sulawesi
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a commodity that plays an important role in supporting economic and social development. However, cacao production can also be a major contributor to carbon emissions, which has stimulated various efforts toward sustainable cacao farm management. There remains a gap in knowledge regarding the links between carbon stocks and carbon footprints, which can serve as indicators of environment "friendliness." In this study, we investigated carbon stocks and carbon footprints in two cacao cultivation systems, agroforests and monocultural systems, and the biophysical aspects (biotic and abiotic factors) that might contribute to the variability of carbon levels. System inventories, soil samples, and farmer interviews identified the characteristics and management practices of two cacao production systems. Results show that cacao agroforests accumulated more carbon stocks than cacao monocultures, 134.4 Mg C ha(-1) and 104.7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, while cacao monocultural systems had higher carbon footprints than cacao agroforests, 1914.4 kg CO(2)e ha(-1) and 932.1 +/- 251.6 kg CO(2)e ha(-1), respectively. Canopy cover, tree density, and soil organic carbon were the biophysical aspects that showed a significantly positive correlation with carbon stock levels, while canopy cover had a significantly negative correlation with carbon footprint levels. These results suggest that cacao agroforests are more climate-friendly management systems due to their ability to maintain high carbon stock levels while producing low carbon footprints.

TI  - Plant and bird diversity in rubber agroforests in the lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant and bird diversity in the Indonesian jungle rubber agroforestry system was compared to that in primary forest and rubber plantations by integrating new and existing data from a lowland rain forest area in Sumatra. Jungle rubber gardens are low-input rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests that structurally resemble secondary forest and in which wild species are tolerated by the farmer. As primary forests have almost completely disappeared from the lowlands of the Sumatra peneplain, our aim was to assess the contribution of jungle rubber as a land use type to the conservation of plant and bird species, especially those that are associated with the forest interior of primary and old secondary forest. Species-accumulation curves were compiled for terrestrial and epiphytic pteridophytes, trees and birds, and for subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds. Comparing jungle rubber and primary forest, groups differed in relative species richness patterns. Species richness in jungle rubber was slightly higher (terrestrial pteridophytes), similar (birds) or lower (epiphytic pteridophytes, trees, vascular plants as a whole) than in primary forest. For subsets of 'forest species' of terrestrial pteridophytes and birds, species richness in jungle rubber was lower than in primary forest. For all groups, species richness in jungle rubber was generally higher than in rubber plantations. Although species conservation in jungle rubber is limited by management practices and by a slash-and-burn cycle for replanting of about 40 years, this forest-like land use does support species diversity in an impoverished landscape increasingly dominated by monoculture plantations.

TI  - Dynamics of medicinal plants knowledge and commerce in an urban ecosystem (Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance of markets and fairs for the commerce of medicinal plants, an ethnobotanical study was undertaken at the Caruaru Fair (Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil) to compare the richness of species sold and their values of relative importance (RI) using two datasets collected with a 4-year interval. The seasonality of these plants' supplies was also analyzed. The Caruaru Fair is located in the 18 de Maio Park. It covers an area 40,000 m(2) and is used by merchants who sell several types of products, such as supplies, handicrafts, clay and aluminum utensils, shoes, clothes and medicinal plants. Semistructured interviews were carried out with the vendors who agreed to take part in the study in order to record which plants were sold and their respective indications. The plants were collected, and the species were determined. The information was analyzed with quantitative tools. A total of 169 plants were identified from both surveys, which were significantly different with regard to species richness (p < 0.05) but did not vary in relation to species' Relative Importance (p > 0.05). In relation to the seasonality of the plant supply, habit may explain the lack of some species during certain periods of the year, as most of the absent plants are herbaceous. In terms of the species most sold locally, it was found that spontaneous tree species are well known and extensively commercialized.

TI  - Influence of shift cultivation dynamics on the creation of diversity of ethnovarieties propagated as clones
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Rainforest is an area of importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Many traditional communities of peasants maintain secular agricultural practices. The relationship between these communities and their environment is of great relevance to the proposition of conservation strategies, because these communities have been interacting with the Rainforest environment through many generations. This paper analyses the influence of agricultural management techniques of shift cultivation on the creation and maintenance of genetic variability of clops at infra and interspecific levels in areas of Atlantic forest in the southern coast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil We have determined the diversity of crops used by traditional family units, establishing inter actions between the management processes used by the agriculturists and the life history components of their crops. For edible uses, 24 ethnospecies were cited (common names), corresponding to II botanical families and 161 varieties. We also discuss ethnotaxonomical features of cultivated species. The maintenance of diversity and its amplification at the garden level are consequences of the interaction between farmer management and life history components of the crops. Natural dispersion and the establishment of soil seed banks associated to disturbance cycles stimulating colonization are examples of processes involved in the dynamics of diversity amplification.

TI  - WEEDS OCCURRENCE IN AREAS SUBMITTED TO DISTINCT WINTER CROPS
T2  - PLANTA DANINHA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Western Region of Brazil, it is usual to have two agricultural harvests in the same cropping season. Usually the first crop is soybean, followed by corn. In areas where corn is not planted due to a delayed harvest of soybean, farmers generally do not use winter crops. For these areas, the planting of winter oilseed crops aiming at the production of bio-fuels is one of the best alternatives; in addition, this would help in reducing the occurrence of weed species at the following summer crop. This study aimed to assessing the weed community in distinct winter crops post soybean crop, in terms of species composition, level of infestation and severity of occurrence. The following treatments were evaluated: agriculture under a no-till system with winter fallow, winter oilseed crops (crambe, radish, rapeseed) with no-till agriculture in the summer, and agriculture under a conventional tillage system with winter fallow. Phytosociological evaluations of all treatments were carried out 75 DAE of the oilseed crops, and the diversity indexes of Margalef, Menhinick, Simpson, and Shannon-Weiner were determined. Areas were also grouped by cluster analysis based on UPGMA applied at Jaccard's similarity matrix. Among the treatments with winter coverage, radish was the most efficient crop in suppressing the occurrence of weed species. The area with conventional tillage agriculture and winter fallow allowed for a higher occurrence of troublesome weeds. On the other hand, the area under fallow showed the highest absolute level of infestation. Overall, oilseed crops in the winter contribute to lower levels of infestation by weed species in these areas.

TI  - Domestic dog invasion in an agroforestry mosaic in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the value of agroforests for biodiversity conservation has been frequently highlighted, little is known about the susceptibility of this production system to biological invasions. Drawing on a camera-trap dataset obtained in 39 sites in an agroforestry mosaic in southern Bahia, Brazil, we investigated whether the conversion of native forests into agroforests and management intensification in agroforests favor the invasion by the most common carnivore worldwide, the domestic dog. We also examined whether domestic dog invasion is more associated with human activity in agroforests than in native forests. While the number of invading dogs was higher in agroforests than in native forests (11 compared to 7 dogs per site), management intensification in agroforests led to a higher mean number of visits per dog. In both habitats (not only agroforests) visits by domestic dogs tended to be concentrated on times of the day (around midday) and days of the week (Monday to Saturday) when there is greater human activity. Despite being permeable to native species, agroforests may act as sink or trap areas given their higher susceptibility to invasion, potentially limiting the value of this production system for biodiversity conservation. Moreover, local management intensification, which has been expanding worldwide, increases the intensity of such invasions, further decreasing the value of agroforests. The value of agroforestry mosaics for conservation thus depends on the management of invasive species and at least in the case of dogs, one of the most common and widely distributed invasive species, this management should focus on the habits and behavior of humans.

TI  - Bacterial functional redundancy along a soil reclamation gradient
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A strategy to measure bacterial functional redundancy was developed and tested with soils collected along a soil reclamation gradient by determining the richness and diversity of bacterial groups capable of in situ growth on selected carbon substrates. Soil cores were collected from four sites along a transect from the Jamari tin mine site in the Jamari National Forest, Rondonia, RO, Brazil: denuded mine spoil, soil from below the canopy of invading pioneer trees, revegetated soil under new growth on the forest edge, and the forest floor of an adjacent preserved forest. Bacterial population responses were analyzed by amending these soil samples with individual carbon substrates in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), BrdU-labeled DNA was then subjected to a 16S-23S rRNA intergenic analysis to depict the actively growing bacteria from each site, The number and diversity of bacterial groups responding to four carbon substrates (L-serine, L-threonine, sodium citrate, and or-lactose hydrate) increased along the reclamation-vegetation gradient such that the preserved forest soil samples contained the highest functional redundancy for each substrate. These data suggest that bacterial functional redundancy increases in relation to the regrowth of plant communities and may therefore represent an important aspect of the restoration of soil biological functionality to reclaimed mine spoils. They also suggest that bacterial functional redundancy may be a useful indicator of soil quality and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Swasta IBJ, Murni IAAD, Amelia JM. 2023. Diversity and abundance of mud crabs (Scylla spp.) living in mangrove forest ecosystems on Serangan Island, Bali. Biodiversitas 24: 5664-5670. The mangrove forest ecosystem on Serangan Island contains dozens of types of aquatic fauna, including mud crabs from the Scylla genus (Scylla spp). The objectives of this study were to obtain the variety and abundance of mud crabs and to determine the variety and abundance of mangroves on Serangan Island after the reclamation. This study's results are expected to make all parties aware of the ecological impact of reclamation activities on the coast. Data on mangrove diversity was collected through observation during a field survey. At the same time, samples of mud crabs were caught randomly using traps (rakang) of as many as 20 units set proportionally around Serangan Island. The fishing gear (rakang) is placed in the afternoon at 18.00, then taken in the morning at 06.00 to see the trapped mud crabs. The data on the diversity and abundance of mud crabs were processed to obtain a diversity index using the diversity index formula (H') from Shannon Wiener and quantitative and qualitative descriptive. The results showed that there are three types of mud crabs around Serangan Island, namely Scylla serrata (47.8%), Scylla olivacea (30.4%), and Scylla tranquebarica (21.8%) with a diversity index (H' ) of mud crabs was 1,047. Scylla serrata has the highest prevalence of 35%, followed by Scylla olivacea (25%) and Scylla tranquebarica (10%). The mangrove community on Serangan Island consists of 6 species, namely Rhizophora apiculate, Rhizophora stylosa, Ceriop tagal, Sonneratia alba, Avicennia lanata, and Brugierra gymnorhiza.

TI  - Effects of habitat type, vegetation structure, and proximity to forests on bird species richness in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.

AB  - Logging activities in natural production forests tend to have negative impacts on soil quality. This study aims to examine the effect of biopore infiltration holes and cross drains on the chemical and physical properties of the soil both on skid trails and in natural forests. The study was conducted at a natural production forest in West Kalimantan. The results showed that there was no significant change in the chemical properties of the soil in both the skid trails and natural forest, except for the higher organic C parameter in the natural forest. There was an increase in organic C from 1.16% to 2.04% (<3%) on the skid trails before and after one year. In general, there was a change in the physical properties of the soil on the skid trails. In the natural forest, the bulk density is lower than that on the skid trails and tends to increase with soil depth. Porosity in the center of the skid trails decreases by 24% compared to that in the natural forests at a depth of 0-10 cm. The phenomenon of degradation is also apparent in the parameters of available water, soil permeability, and drainage pores in the middle of the skid trails.

TI  - Genetic conservation of a threatened Neotropical palm through community-management of fruits in agroforests and second-growth forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted to achieve both conservation and economic outcomes in the management of tropical forests by local communities, but monitoring the impacts of NTFPs harvesting is still challenging. Monitoring genetic diversity is a promising approach to assess harvesting impacts and guide best practices. Here, we evaluated the value of community-managed agroforests and secondary forests for conserving genetic structure and diversity of Euterpe edulis, an endemic palm explored for fruit and palm heart production. We used SSR markers to compare genetic diversity in populations growing in protected areas, in agroforests and in second-growth forests managed for fruit production in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In addition, we investigated the genetic diversity of seeds extracted during pulp removal, which have been used in E. edulis reintroduction programs. Overall, high levels of genetic diversity were observed for all populations (mean allelic richness = 7.06; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.787), with no significant differences in genetic diversity among agroforests, second-growth forests and protected areas. Managed forests and protected areas had low to intermediate levels of genetic differentiation (global Fixation Index = 0.085), indicating the existence of gene flow among them. Seeds extracted during fruit pulp removal had as high genetic variability as populations growing in protected areas, thus evidencing the potential of using these seeds to recover overexploited populations. Thus, community-management of NTFPs in agroforests and second growth forests may support genetic conservation of this threatened species, complementing the conservation role of protected areas.

TI  - EFFECT OF CROPPING SYSTEMS IN NO-TILL FARMING ON THE QUALITY OF A BRAZILIAN OXISOL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The no-till system with complex cropping sequences may improve the structural quality and carbon (C) sequestration in soils of the tropics. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cropping sequences after eight years under the no-till system on the physical properties and C sequestration in an Oxisol in the municipality of Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A randomized split-block design with three replications was used. The treatments were combinations of three summer cropping sequences -corn/corn (Zea mays L.) (CC), soybean/soybean (Glycine max L. Merryll) (SS), and soybean-corn (SC); and seven winter crops -corn, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). Soil samples were taken at the 0-10 cm depth after eight years of experimentation. Soil under SC and CC had higher mean weight diameter (3.63 and 3.55 mm, respectively) and geometric mean diameter (3.55 and 2.92 mm) of the aggregates compared to soil under SS (3.18 and 2.46 mm). The CC resulted in the highest soil organic C content (17.07 g kg(-1)), soil C stock (15.70 Mg ha(-1)), and rate of C sequestration (0.70 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) among the summer crops. Among the winter crops, soil under pigeon pea had the highest total porosity (0.50 m(3) m(-3)), and that under sunn hemp had the highest water stable aggregates (93.74 %). In addition, sunn hemp did not differ from grain sorghum and contained the highest soil organic C content (16.82 g kg(-1)) and also had the highest rate of C sequestration (0.67 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soil resistance to penetration was the lower limit of the least limiting water range, while the upper limit was air-filled porosity for soil bulk densities higher than 1.39 kg dm(-3) for all cropping sequences. Within the SC sequence, soil under corn and pigeon pea increased least limiting water range by formation of biopores because soil resistance to penetration decreased with the increase in soil bulk density.

TI  - Carbon saturation deficit and litter quality drive the stabilization of litter-derived C in mineral-associated organic matter in long-term no-till soil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term no-till cropping systems can induce significant differences in the mineral associated organic matter (MAOM) saturation levels but little is known on the effect of MAOM saturation on "new " C stabilization from added litter in different fractions of soil organic matter (SOM). We assessed the effect of C saturation deficit (Csd) in the MAOM on C stabilization in different SOM fractions in the surface layers of a sandy clay loam Acrisol under five no-till cropping systems adopted over 36 years in a field experiment. The cropping systems with varying C inputs led to a range of C content and Csd in the MAOM (< 20 mu m) in a thin soil layer (0-5 cm). In each field plot with different Csd levels,C- 13-labeled litter from shoot biomass of black oat (grass) and vetch (legume) was added at a rate equivalent to 4.5 Mg ha(-1)C in PVC collars. After 15-month field incubation, soil was sampled and physically fractionated. Higher C stabilization in MAOM was observed for legume than grass-derived C in the top 0-2.5 cm layer, but only for soils with higher C stabilization capacity. When litter-derived C stabilization in MAOM was limited by its previous C level close to saturation, C incorporation was greater in the intra-and inter -aggregate SOM fractions. Our findings revealed that Csd and litter quality affect C stabilization in surface soil layers of no-till soils, and when C stabilization in MAOM is low due to saturation of the MAOM fraction, the C accrual occurs preferentially in labile and intra-aggregate fractions in long-term no-till soils. Therefore, sus-tainable management practices that promote continuous and diversified C inputs involving legume cover crops are crucial to sustain C incorporation in relatively stable forms in long-term no-till soils.

AB  - Andongrejo Village is one of the buffer villages of Meru Betiri National Park (TNMB). The lack of baseline data related to the diversity of vegetation in agroforestry system surrounding TNMB requires further research as a conservation effort and sustainable ecosystem management purpose. The objectives of this research were to: (a) analyze the structure and composition of vegetation in agroforestry system, (b) analyze the diversity of vegetation in agroforestry system, as well as (c) analyze correlation of canopy density with the diversity of seedlings and understorey in agroforestry system in Andongrejo village, Jember Regency, East Java. The method used was purposive vegetation sampling and vegetation analysis. The number of individual (ind/ha) in all three canopy density classes did not show reverse J-curve. The dominant species found were Banana (Musa sp.), Teak (Tectona grandis), and Sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria). The species richness and diversity index at all tree level growth were clasified into low diversity and low species richness. The higher percentage of canopy density results in the higher individuals per ha and the number of species per ha (r = 0.500 and r = 0.696). The implementation of enrichment planting with species that has high economic value at all tree level growth are necessary. Introducing fruit species is one of alternative ways to increase the local community's income and conserve the diversity in agroforestry system. Silviculture technique (eg prunning) is necessary to maintain the diversity and tree level growth in this location.

TI  - Simulating soil C dynamics under intensive agricultural systems and climate change scenarios in the Matopiba region, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent agricultural expansion in the Matopiba region, Brazil's new agricultural frontier, has raised questions about the risk of increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) loss as large areas of native vegetation (NV; i.e., Cerrado biome) have been replaced by large-scale mechanized agriculture. Although sustainable managements, such as integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems, are considered strategic to counterbalance the SOC loss associated with land-use change (LUC) while keeping food production, little is known about their long-term effects on SOC stocks in the Matopiba region. To this end, we used the DayCent model to simulate the effects of converting the management commonly used in this region, i.e., soybean-cotton rotation under no-tillage (NT), into ICL systems with distinct levels of intensification (e.g., crop rotations: soybean-pasture and soybean-pasture-cotton; soil and crop management: grass irrigation, scarification/harrowing, and length of grass cultivation) on long term SOC dynamics. Additionally, data from two projected climate scenarios: SSP2-4.5 [greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) will not change markedly over time and global temperature will increase by 2.0 degrees C by 2060] and SSP5-8.5 (marked changes in GHG emissions are expected to occur resulting in an increase of 2.4 and 4.4 degrees C in global temperature in the middle and at the end of the century) were included in our simulations to evaluate climate change effects on SOC dynamics in this region. Based on a 50-yr-time frame simulation, we observed that SOC stocks under ICL systems were, on average, 23% and 47% higher than in the NV (36.9 Mg ha -1) and soybean -cotton rotation under NT (30.9 Mg ha -1), respectively. Growing grasses interlaid with crops was crucial to in-crease SOC stocks even when disruptive soil practices were followed. Although the irrigation of grass resulted in an early increase of SOC stocks and a higher pasture stoking rate, it did not increase SOC stocks in the long term compared to non-irrigated treatments. The SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios had little effects on SOC dynamics in the simulated ICL systems. However, additional SOC loss (-0.065 Mg ha- 1 yr -1) is predicted to occur if the current management is not improved. These findings can help guide management decisions for the Matopiba region, Brazil, to alleviate the anthropogenic pressure associated with agriculture development. More broadly, they confirm that crop-livestock integration in croplands is a successful strategy to regenerate SOC.

TI  - ALLOMETRIC EQUATIONS FOR ESTIMATING CARBON OF URBAN TREES IN VICOSA-MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to generate equations to estimate carbon in trees of the main campus of Universidade Federal de Vicosa, contributing to the knowledge about the ability of urban green areas in removing and storing carbon. Thus, every tree with DBH less than 5 cm located at the university was inventoried. For no palm trees, were selected 721 sample trees, which were rigorously cubed by successive application of Smalian expression until 5 cm of diameter, for trunk and twigs. Regarding the palm trees, 100% of the individuals were cubed using the Huber expression. The basic density of wood with bark and content carbon were obtained, in palm trees, by removing a disk on DBH, due to the difficult of borehole. For the other trees, a mechanical auger was used. Based on the volume with bark, the basic density and carbon content, we calculated the total carbon and carbon in the twigs. Furthermore, we evaluated the Schumacher & Hall (1933) and Spurr (1952) modified models to estimate the carbon fixed in these individuals. In the case of no palm trees, the total carbon and the branches carbon can be estimated, in kg, according to the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH in cm) and Total Height (TH, in meters), by -0,906586+1,60421*LnDAP+0,37162*LnHt e por -2,052673+1,89903*LnDAP+0,24156*LnHt, in this order. In palms, the total carbon can be estimated by -4,46988+199082*LnDBH+1,06420*LnTH.

TI  - Tropical riparian forests in danger from large savanna wildfires
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical savannas are known for the fire-prone ecosystems, yet, riparian evergreen forests are another important landscape feature. These forests usually remain safe from wildfires in the wet riparian zones. With global changes, large wildfires are now more frequent in savanna landscapes, exposing riparian forests to unprecedented impact.In 2017, a large wildfire spread across the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, an iconic UNESCO site in central Brazil, raising concerns about its impact on the fire-sensitive ecosystems. By combining remote sensing analysis of Google Earth images (2003-2019) with detailed field information from 36 sites, we assessed wildfire impacts on riparian forests. For this, we measured the structure of trees, saplings and herbaceous plants, as well as topsoil variables.Since 2003, all riparian forests had canopy cover above 90%, but after 2017, canopy cover dropped to 20% in some forests, indicating large variation in wildfire damage. A closer look in the field revealed that, on average, the wildfire killed 52% of adult trees and 87% of tree saplings in flooded forests. In non-flooded forests, impacts on adult trees were negligible, but fire killed 75% of tree saplings. Opportunistic vines and the invasive grass Melinis minutiflora were already present in severely disturbed flooded forests. In all forests, impacts on many ecosystem variables were related to canopy damage, a variable measurable from satellite. Overall, seasonally flooded riparian forests were the most severely impacted, possibly due to the relatively thinner barks of their trees.Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal how riparian forests embedded in tropical savanna landscapes are in danger from large wildfires. The destruction of some forests has opened space for new plant species that may propel a shift to an alternative ecosystem state. Riparian forests are habitat of large savanna animals and their loss could affect entire trophic networks. Managing wildfires and invasive grasses locally is probably the best strategy to maintain riparian forests resilient. As wildfire regimes intensify in tropical savanna landscapes, our findings stress the need for an integrated management that considers riparian forests as a vulnerable element of the system.

TI  - Tillage method and crop rotation effects on the population sizes and diversity of bradyrhizobia nodulating soybean
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in an area of Brazil cultivated with soybean since the early 1960's but which for the last 17 yr was under different tillage (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage, CT) and crop rotation (soybean, S/wheat, W/maize, M; S/W; M/W) systems. The area had not received any inoculant for the last 15 yr and our objective was to investigate the effects of tillage and cropping systems on the bradyrhizobia population. The NT system and crop rotations with soybean resulted in high populations of bradyrhizobia, but even in the treatment where soybean had not been cultivated for 17 yr (M/W) the number of viable cells in the soil was high. A total of 142 bradyrhizobia isolated from the different treatments were characterized based on colony morphology, serological reaction, DNA analysis by RAPD, protein and Nod factors profiles. The analyses resulted in grouping of the isolates into 16 DNA, five protein and three Nod factors profiles. A high proportion (37.5%) of the isolates did not react with any known serogroup. Both NT and crop rotations with soybean resulted in a higher bradyrhizobia diversity, with the lowest number of genomic patterns occurring in the CT with M/W rotation. However, there was no relationship between the treatment combinations and genetic relatedness. The evaluation of symbiotic performance under greenhouse conditions showed that the isolates with higher rates of Nz fixation were also isolated from NT with S/W or S/W/M crop rotations. Consequently, the use of agronomic practices such as NT and crop rotation with legumes will not only contribute to agricultural sustainability, but also help to maintain bradyrhizobia population and diversity.

TI  - Communities of P-solubilizing bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grass pasture and secondary forest of Paraty, RJ Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Communities of P-solubilizing bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, were evaluated in two different ecosystems. Samplings taken from two areas of Atlantic forest, in Paraty - RJ, Brazil, one with a secondary forest and the other with a grass pasture were studied. Four growth media: GL (glucose and yeast extract), GES (glucose, soil extract, KNO3, CaCl2, MgSO4, NaCl, FeEDTA and micronutrients solution), GAGES (glucose, soil extract, arabinose, glycerol, CaCl2, MgSO4 and NaCl) and GELP (glucose, soil extract, yeast extract, peptone, CaCl2, MgSO4 and NaCl) were evaluated for the isolation of P-solubilizing microorganisms. The identification of P-solubilizing bacteria was based on 16 S rDNA sequence analysis, while the identification of P-solubilizing fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was based on morphology. The greatest number of P-solubilizing bacteria was isolated using GL and GELP growth media. The greatest number of P-solubilizing fungi was isolated using GAGES and GES. The bacteria were identified as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus sp., while the P-solubilizing fungi were identified as Aspergillus sp. Glomus macrocarpum and Glomus etunicatum were the dominant mycorrhizal fungi in the secondary forest and grass pasture area, respectively.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in an alley cropping system in the state of Maranhao, Brazil
T2  - Acta Amazonica
M3  - Article
AB  - Alley cropping systems may be a solution for land use in tropical regions. How land use is connected to mycorrhizal arbuscular fungi (AMP) is poorly understood, especially in the tropics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of leguminous trees in an alley cropping system in regard to the infectivity and diversity of native AMF species in Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. Soil samples were collected in an experimental area of the Universidade Estadual do Maranhao (UEMA) - Sao Luis, in two seasons (July/2006 and April/2007), two distances (0 in and 0.5 m) from the trunk of three leguminous trees (Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria fairchildiana e Acacia mangium), and in a control area 0-20 cm deep. Soil samples were used to evaluate the infectivity of AMF, density and diversity of glomerospores. The alley cropping systems increased the infectivity of AMF which varied according to the leguminous tree species, raining season and distance from trees. Sixteen AMF species of five genera were identified in the area, and Scutellospora was the most representative genus.

TI  - Arthropod responses to the experimental isolation of Amazonian forest fragments
T2  - ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Food sovereignty: an alternative paradigm for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in Latin America.
T2  - F1000Research
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Strong feedback between global biodiversity loss and persistent, extreme rural poverty are major challenges in the face of concurrent food, energy, and environmental crises. This paper examines the role of industrial agricultural intensification and market integration as exogenous socio-ecological drivers of biodiversity loss and poverty traps in Latin America. We then analyze the potential of a food sovereignty framework, based on protecting the viability of a diverse agroecological matrix while supporting rural livelihoods and global food production. We review several successful examples of this approach, including ecological land reform in Brazil, agroforestry, milpa, and the uses of wild varieties in smallholder systems in Mexico and Central America. We highlight emergent research directions that will be necessary to assess the potential of the food sovereignty model to promote both biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction.

TI  - SOIL AGGREGATION AND CARBON STOCK OF A PALEUDULT UNDER DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL MANAGAMENTS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil functions and quality are closely linked to soil structure. The effect of management practices on the recovery of the aggregation of a physically degraded soil was studied based on the distribution of water-stable aggregates and single particles (diameter classes 9.51-4,76, 4.76-2.00, 2.00-0.25, 0.25-0.053, < 0.053 mm) and carbon stock (C) in the surface layer (0-7.5 cm) of a Paleudult in the Central Depression region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, under different management systems. The following systems were evaluated in experimental plots after 17 years: soil without plants and without tillage (fallow); no-till Lablab purpureus and maize (Zea mays) (Lablab / m); Cajanus cajan (peal m) and maize; perennial pasture of Digitaria decumbens (Pangola grass). The following systems were evaluated after 15 years: conventional tillage and no-till Avena strigosa and maize (CT a/m and NT a/m, respectively) Avena strigosa + Vicia sativa and maize + Vigna unguiculata (CT av / mu and NT av / mu, respectively). A conventionally tilled area was also evaluated after 30 years of grain cultivation (crop) and native grassland (NGr), representing the degraded state and the native ecosystem of this soil, respectively. Undisturbed soil samples collected in two seasons (September 1999 to September 2000) were evaluated in six replications per management system. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test (5 %) to detect differences between management systems. In the NGr, 76.4 % of the soil aggregates consisted of 63.8 % macroaggregates and of 23.6 % of single particles, and a C stock of 20.0 Mg ha(-1). The agricultural use with intense soil tillage and low residue application (crop) reduced the proportion of soil aggregates to 49.9 % and raised single particles to 50.1 %, while the C stock decreased to 11.8 Mg ha(-1). From this condition, 15 years of the untilled system with greater diversity of plant species and high residue application (NT au I mc) raised the proportion of soil aggregates to 70.7% and of macroaggregates to 53.5 %. Perennial pasture (Pangola) increased the proportion of soil aggregates to 74.1 % and of macroaggregates to 61.8 %, equaling NGr. The systems NT av / mc, pea / m and Lablab / m recovered C stocks to the level of NGr. Although Pangola had the highest soil aggregation rates, the C stock was lower than in the said systems, emphasizing the positive action of a dense root system in the recovery of soil aggregation.

TI  - Epiphytic bromeliads as key components for maintenance of ant diversity and ant-bromeliad interactions in agroforestry system canopies
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa is produced in a wide range of land use systems, with the traditional shaded systems in Bahia (Brazil) as the most forest-like and biodiverse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different cocoa agroforestry systems (AFSs) in maintaining community structure and interactions between ants and epiphytic bromeliads. The study was conducted at four sites in the cocoa producing region of the southeastern of the state of Bahia, Brazil, and comprised a native forest and three different cocoa AFSs. We found a total of 103 ant species associated with epiphytic bromeliads, with 83% of the species occurring in native forest canopy bromeliads also occurring in cocoa AFSs. The Cocoa Cabruca System (CAB) and the Rustic-Planted Shade System (RPS) had ant community structural components of biodiversity similar to those found in the native forest environment. The alpha and gamma diversity of ants found in Monospecific-Shaded Cocoa Agroforestry System (MCA) associated with Erythrina spp. shade trees were significantly different from the diversity found in the other AFSs and native forest. The presence of epiphytic bromeliads, regardless of the system and scale, maintained ant diversity in agroforestry system canopies similar to that of native forest. Using metrics derived from graph theory, we found a high level of specialization regarding ant-bromeliad interactions in native West, with a gradual decrease in specialization with environmental homogenization. Agroforestry systems thus represent an important strategy for maintaining the structure of canopy-associated ant communities by enabling the establishment of numerous bromeliad species, thus contributing to the maintenance of ant diversity and services in a mosaic landscape AFSs and native forest.

AB  - A survey of Scolytidae population of species of Scolytidae family was made in plantations of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh, Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. f., Eucalyptus pellita F. Muell. and Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake, located at Cuiaba city in Mato Grosso state from march 1998 to february 1999, with aid of ethanol traps model "escolitideo-Curitiba". The were used 24 traps, six per Eucalyptus plot/specie. Collection was made every 15 days and divided in two periods: drought (may - October) and rRainy Season (november - april). There were collected a total of 19.153 individuals, distributed in 11 genera and 42 species. In the dry and rain periods there were collected 9.865 and 9.288 individuals, respectively. In plantations of Eucalyptus pellita and Eucalyptus urophylla were collected the largest amount of individuals, in both analyzed periods. Cryptocarenus diademantus Eggers, 1937; Cryptocarenus seriatus Eggers, 1933; Cryptocarenus heveae (Hagedorni, 1912); Hypothenemus obscurus (Fabricius, 1801) and Xyleborus spinosulus (Schedl, 1934) were in number, the most important in plantations of the four species of Eucalyptus.

TI  - Predatory beetles in cacao agroforestry systems in Brazilian Atlantic forest: a test of the natural enemy hypothesis
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural enemy hypothesis predicts a positive correlation between plant species diversity and natural enemy control. This study aimed to evaluate the role of traditional cacao agroforests, known as "cabrucas," on the conservation of the predatory beetle community compared to that of monodominant rubber agroforests. Predatory beetles were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: cabrucas and rubber agroforests and native Atlantic forests. In each habitat, 18 10 m(2) plots were established, in which canopy cover was measured and beetles were sampled with a modified Malaise/window trap. Land use intensification did not affect the composition of predatory beetles, with the presence of widely distributed species that are also capable of colonizing simpler environments such as the rubber agroforest. Canopy cover had a positive effect on generalist predator diversity and we observed a reduction in the abundance and species richness of generalist predators with increasing habitat homogenization. Despite the simplified structure of the habitat, the remaining tree diversity and canopy cover in cabrucas supported a community of generalist predators similar to the one found in the native forest. Species diversity of bark beetle predators was higher in cabrucas, which may be due to the high diversity of bark beetles and the favorable abiotic conditions, whereas the low abundance of prey in the native forest and severe abiotic conditions in the rubber agroforest probably determined the lower diversity of generalist predators in these habitats. Cabrucas play an important role in the conservation, supporting a community of predatory beetles more similar to the one found in native forest and that is more effective at controlling populations of herbivores than in homogeneous rubber agroforests.

TI  - Chemical composition of cover crops and soil organic matter pools in no-tillage systems in the Cerrado
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In no-tillage systems (NTS), cover crops are recommended to increase the productivity of agricultural systems. Furthermore, a greater diversity of cover crops in NTS favours an increase in soil carbon (C) stocks. However, there are scarce published data on the relationship between the chemical composition of cover crops and the accumulation of labile and stable fractions of SOM. We evaluated the relationship between the chemical composition of cover crops and SOM fractions, C stocks and maize yield. Hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin contents were determined for Urochloa ruziziensis, Canavalia brasiliensis, Cajanus cajan and Sorghum bicolor, cultivated in the off-season of maize. Canavalia brasiliensis had high N (20.96 g kg(-1)) and hemicellulose (185.67 g kg(-1)) contents, lower lignin content (39.50 g kg(-1)) and high dry matter yield (3,251 kg ha(-1)). All these characteristics resulted in a better SOM quality. Urochloa ruziziensis, with higher hemicellulose and lower lignin contents, and low lignin/N ratio, was associated with accumulation of TOC (19.95 and 18.33 g kg(-1) in 0- to 10-cm and 10- to 20-cm layers, respectively) and mineral-associated organic C (on average, 16.68 g kg(-1)) in the soil. Cover plants with N:lignin ratio lower than 2.0 are fundamental for soil C sequestration. In conclusion, it is recommended the adoption of Urochloa ruziziensis and Canavalia brasiliensis as cover plants improve maize production, soil organic matter quality and C sequestration in the Cerrado region.

TI  - A Holistic Approach to the Selection of Soybean (Glycine max) Cultivars for Shade Environments Based on Morphological, Yield and Genetic Traits
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of photosynthetically active radiation impacts the growth and productivity of soybean in agroforestry and intercropping systems. Thus, this report explored the responses of 16 soybean cultivars submitted to shade levels in field conditions. Multi-faceted and relative importance analyses revealed that the steam diameter and plant height are fundamental morphological markers for selecting shade-resilient cultivars, both were high and positively correlated to yield components. Moreover, the responses to shade varied among soybean cultivars, with certain genotypes demonstrating distinct tolerance levels, which allowed also the estimative of genetic variance that revealed strong participation of genetic components in responses to shade. Multivariate and clustering analysis using steam diameter and plant height in combination with two yield components resulted in the identification of four soybean cultivars more tolerant to shade environments and two sensible. Therefore, this report provides insights into soybean cultivation under varying light conditions, provides a robust foundation for the integration of morphological and yield markers in breeding programmes focused on shade tolerance and guides future endeavours in crop improvement for optimal and sustainable yield and resilience in the climate change context.

TI  - Deforestation and the environmental Kuznets curve: A cross-national investigation of intervening mechanisms
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We draw on ecological modernization theory and international political economy arguments to examine the sources of an environmental Kuznets curve (or EKC) that produces an inverted U-shaped rate of deforestation relative to economic development. Method. We use ordinary least squares regression with White's ( 1978) correction Cor possible heteroskedasticity to examine the rate of deforestation (1980-1995) in less developed countries. Results. Net of controls for initial forest stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the level of urbanization, (2) rural-to-urban migration that partially offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services-dominated urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states. We Find little evidence that foreign debt or export dependence influence the deforestation rate. Conclusions. Although deforestation continues to pose pressing and potentially irreversible environmental risks, there is evidence of self-corrective ecological and modernization processes inherent in development that act to mitigate these risks.Deforestation is a pressing environmental problem involving permanent loss of species, soil degradation, impact on global climate change, and long-term resource depletion. Of the approximately 3.4 billion hectares of forest land that existed around the globe in 1980, approximately 5 percent had been cleared by 1995 (FAO, 1997). Although some decline in the rate of deforestation has been detected in the 1990s (with rapid deforestation in some regions being offset by uneven decreases in Brazil and reforestation in some developed nations), there is no guarantee of abatement in the near future (World Resources Institute, 2000). Given the inextricable links between forest cover and biodiversity, soil quality, and atmospheric replenish-ment, understanding the causes and consequences of deforestation must be central to both natural and social environmental science.Of the various forms of environmental degradation, deforestation holds a special appeal because (1) the felling of trees is spatially fixed and therefore more amenable to study, (2) deforestation is unambiguously due to human activities, and (3) the loss of forest cover is uniquely intertwined with nearly all other forms of environmental degradation. This article extends and improves on prior cross-national analyses of deforestation. Whereas most past studies have been empirical and descriptive, more recent investigations have been more theoretical, emphasizing modernization processes, demographic pressures, and dependency/world systems constraints (e.g., Rock, 1996; Rudel and Roper, 1997; Ehrhardt-Martinez, 1998, 1999). As a part of this theorizing, the existence and implications of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) have garnered increasing attention. Given that the actual meaning of this curvilinear relationship between development and deforestation depends heavily on the intervening mechanisms linking the two, the purpose of this investigation is first to establish the existence of an EKC for deforestation and then to examine various competing explanations for this pattern.

TI  - The Impact of Traditional Silvopastoral System on the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest Remnants
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of an evaluation of the impact of traditional silvopastoral system on floristic and phytosociology of the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF) remnants, named caivas, in the North Plateau of Santa Catarina, South of Brazil are shown here to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of human activities on natural environments,. There was significant heterogeneity in floristic and structural aspects among the remnants. They exhibited high floristic integrity, with the presence of species typically registered in MOF. On the other hand, the incidence of exotic species was inexpressive. The predominance of smaller plant individuals than expected for adults of the species, combined with the predominance of secondary and pioneer species indicate the occurrence of repeated disturbances over the years. It is urgent to identify technological alternatives to enable appropriate foraging and increase in livestock production, ensuring economic and social sustainability with less environmental impact.

TI  - Fuzzy-based methodological proposal for participatory diagnosis in the linear parks management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Participatory decision-making in the management of linear parks can provide better outcomes than classical top down procedures. However, the integration of technical knowledge with the understanding of the community requires an approach able to deal with uncertainty, due to the issues of vagueness and subjectivity. Therefore, the present paper introduces a fuzzy-based proposal for supporting participatory diagnosis. For this purpose, five Mamdani-type systems were built based on the knowledge of experts, including as indicators the species richness of fauna and flora, land cover, basic and recreational facilities, support services, and the park users' perceptions. By integrating such indicators, three indexes were obtained for assessing the natural condition, infrastructure, and functional performance of a linear park. The proposed system was then applied in a case study of the Tiquatira linear park in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. The results indicated that the park has' high functional performance, but that improvements in its natural condition and infrastructure are needed, such as the reclamation of disturbed areas and ongoing maintenance of the facilities. The use of fuzzy modeling enabled integration of the technical assessment by experts and the users' perception, in order to support a participatory diagnosis taking into account the existing uncertainties. In conclusion, this fuzzy-based proposal can be considered a promising approach for the participatory management of linear parks. In future studies, techniques for the case-by-case weighting of variables could be assessed, in order to strengthen the systems described in the present paper.

TI  - Amazon plinthosols: carbon stocks and physical properties under different land uses
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The population growth and the climate changes impose challenges to society, especially regarding food supply and the maintenance of desirable soil conditions. Besides, it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, there is a necessity of studies addressing the understanding of soil conditions under different land uses, as soils can become carbon pools or sources depending on management practices. This study was conducted in soil profiles of Amazon Plinthosols under different land uses: undisturbed forests, cattle ranching pastures, and mixed crops. Soil density and carbon fraction were assessed at four depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm), while particle size and mineralogy were examined at 0-20 and 20-40 cm. Soils under undisturbed forests presented lower densities and higher carbon fractions when compared to other land uses. These soils also presented the highest carbon stock; however, the Tukey test indicated no significant differences. Soil densities were lower in forest environments. Cattle ranching pastures presented higher carbon stocks when compared to mixed crops (at age 10 years). Our results indicated that proper soil management practices are needed to maintain the soil productive capacity after converting forested areas for other uses. Plinthosols, due to its textural and mineralogical characteristics, presented high amounts of quartz, demonstrating how sensitive these environments are to changes in the landscape due to deforestation and how unstable the maintenance of carbon stocks is because of such conditions. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon stock in Amazon Plinthosols. It may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and to understand the impacts of land-use change.

TI  - Richness and abundance of Aechmea and Hohenbergia (Bromeliaceae) in forest fragments and shade cocoa plantations in two contrasting landscapes in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of agricultural activity can have profound impacts on biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of the landscape's percentage of forest cover and shaded cocoa plantations on the community of zoochorous bromeliads in southern Bahia, Brazil. We selected two contrasting landscapes, one dominated by Atlantic tropical rainforest and the other by traditional cocoa plantations. In each landscape we sampled three forest fragments and three areas of cocoa plantation, where we conducted a survey of epiphytic bromeliads of the genera Aechmea and Hohenbergia in eight plots of 400 m(2) in each area. The number of trees differed between landscapes and habitats, and was higher in forest fragments than in shade cocoa plantations, but the number of phorophytes was similar between landscapes and habitats. Highest richness of Aechmea and Hohenbergia species was found in forest fragments in landscapes where forests are predominant. Contrary to expectations, the richness in the other areas was relatively low, and extremely low in the landscape dominated by cocoa plantations, ranging from zero to four species per fragment. Bromeliad abundance was not different among landscapes and habitats, but the shade cocoa plantations located in predominant agroforest landscape showed the higher number of stands. Moreover, the species found in the cocoa plantations were more drought-tolerant species. These results suggest that the conservation of species of these genera depends on factors such as the conservation status of each forest fragment and the microclimatic alterations in the habitats, and not only on the percentage of forest in the landscape per se.

TI  - Changes of dung beetle communities from rainforests towards agroforestry systems and annual cultures in Sulawesi (Indonesia)
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about how tropical land-use systems contribute to the conservation of functionally important insect groups, including dung beetles. In a study at the margin of Lore Lindu National Park (a biodiversity hotspot in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia) dung-beetle communities were sampled in natural forest, young secondary forest, agroforestry systems (cacao plantations with shade trees) and annual cultures (maize fields), each with four replicates (n = 16 sites). At each site we used 10 pitfall traps, baited with cattle dung, along a 100 m transect for six 3-day periods. The number of trapped specimens and species richness at the natural forest sites was higher than in all land-use systems, which did not significantly differ. Each land-use system contained, on average, 75% of the species richness of the natural forest, thereby indicating their importance for conservation. However, a two-dimensional scaling plot based on NESS indices (m = 6) indicated distinct dung beetle communities for both forest types, while agroforestry systems and annual cultures exhibited a pronounced overlap. Mean body size of dung beetles was not significantly influenced by land-use intensity. Five of the six most abundant dung beetle species were recorded in all habitats, whereas the abundance of five other species was significantly related to habitat type. Mean local abundance and number of occupied sites were closely correlated, further indicating little habitat specialisation. The low dung beetle diversity (total of 18 recorded species) may be due to the absence of larger mammals in Sulawesi during historical times, even though Sulawesi is the largest island of Wallacea. In conclusion, the dung beetle fauna of the lower montane forest zone in Central Sulawesi appears to be relatively robust to man-made habitat changes and the majority of species did not exhibit strong habitat preferences.

TI  - Similarity of ant communities increases with isolation from natural habitat and abundance of invasive ants in oil palm plantations of Central Borneo
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural habitats can support insect diversity and shape their community structure in agroecosystems. The objective of this research was to investigate how proximity of natural habitat and invasive ant species influences the community structure of ants in oil palm plantations in Central Borneo, Indonesia. Twelve oil palm fields, at varying distances from areas of remaining forest or natural habitat, were selected as research plots. In each plot, insects were sampled using canopy knockdown fogging with a pyrethroid insecticide. In total, we found 62 canopy ant species belonging to six subfamilies. We found that Anoplolepis gracilipes (invasive species) and Oecophylla smaragdina were the most abundant ant species across all of our plots, and their abundances were not spatially correlated. Distance of oil palm fields to natural habitat did not affect species richness and abundance of ants, but affected ant community similarity. Based on the generalized linear models, the ant community similarity was not only affected by the distance to natural habitat but also affected by the abundance of A. gracilipes. A. gracilipes abundance also had a negative effect on other ant abundance especially O. smaragdina. In conclusion, the occurrence of natural habitats helps shape the similarity of ant community in oil palm plantations possibly via inhibits the abundance of invasive species.

TI  - The snake community of Serra do Mendanha, in Rio de Janeiro State, southeastern Brazil: composition, abundance, richness and diversity in areas with different conservation degrees
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied and compared parameters of the snake community of the Serra do Mendanha, Rio de Janeiro State, southeastern Brazil (22 degrees 48'-22 degrees 51' S and 43 degrees 31'-43 degrees 28' W), such as: abundance distribution, richness, species diversity and biomass, between forested areas, areas under regeneration and agriculture areas (banana plantations); to obtain information about the natural history and facilitate the development of future research. For capturing the snakes we used: pitfall traps, drift-fences and visual search (diurnal and nocturnal) along four transects for each habitat. The captured snakes were measured with a tape and caliper, weighed with dynamometers and sexed with the use of a catheter. The animals marked (with ventral scales cut) were released for posterior recapture. One individual per species was fixed and deposited at the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro. We undertook an effort of 840 man/hour, and captured a total of 207 snakes belonging to 25 species (Colubridae 80.2%, Elapidae 12.6%, Viperidae 6.3% and Boidae 0.9%). The most abundant were: Liophis miliaris (n = 33), Micrurus corallinus and Chironius fuscus (both with n = 26); the least abundant: Elapomorphus quinquelineatus, Siphlophis compressus and Tropidodryas serra (all with n = 1). The species that contributed the greatest biomass were Spilotes pullatus (7,925 g), Chironius laevicollis (4,694 g), Liophis miliaris (3,675 g) and Pseustes sulphureus (3,050 g); those that contributed the lowest biomass were: Siphlophis compressus, Tropidodryas serra (both with 4 g) and Elapomorphus quinquelineatus Q g). We found significant differences between the sampled habitats at the Serra do Mendanha (undisturbed forest, secondary forest and banana plantations). The results showed that a great reduction in the abundance, richness, diversity and biomass of the snakes occurs when the native forest is replaced by banana plantations.

TI  - Homegardens in the Central Amazon: characterization, social importance and agrobiodiversity
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to describe the main characteristics of homegardens in Central Amazon, as well as to evaluate the social importance and contribution of these agroecosystems to the conservation of agrobiodiversity. Three hundred and thirty-four (334) homegardens in 14 municipalities in the state of Para were sampled, Brazil. The owners or those responsible for the homegardens were interviewed for the collection of history, uses and management of these homegardens. The homegardens of Central Amazon are managed from low to medium intensity with the use of internal inputs and the main criteria for selecting plants are related to their potential use, shade formation and longevity of the species. In addition to the production of food for family consumption, homegardens have aesthetic, social, recreational and religious functions. The homegardens in Central Amazon have an important role in the conservation of agrobiodiversity.

TI  - Key tree species for the golden-headed lion tamarin and implications for shade-cocoa management in southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas occurs in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, where shade-cocoa agroforestry (known as cabruca) predominates. The economic decline of the cocoa industry has caused many landowners to convert cabruca into cattle pasture or diversify their plantations with other crops. These and prior anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation are threatening lion tamarin persistence. For some lion tamarin groups, cabruca comprises a large part of their home range. Considering these factors, the maintenance of the biological diversity in cabruca favorable to golden-headed lion tamarins is of considerable interest to their long-term survival. Here we identify plant species that provide food and sleeping sites for the lion tamarins and examine their occurrence in cabruca plantations, in order to investigate alternatives for conservation management practices that benefit both lion tamarins and cabruca. We determined the total number of trees and the frequency of individuals and species used for food and sleeping sites by lion tamarins in Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, from 1998 to 2006. We used this information to compare the richness and frequency of use across habitats (cabruca, mature and secondary) and to create a ranking index considering various components of a tree species' utility to the lion tamarins. Lion tamarins used 155 tree species, 93 for food and 93 for sleeping sites. Fifty-five species were ranked as 'Extremely Valuable,' eight as 'Valuable' and 92 as 'Of Interest.' Of 48 families, Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were used the most. Cabruca contained fewer individual trees used by lion tamarins, but the highest frequency of use per tree compared with other habitats, indicating the large influence of single trees in these plantations. Using the key tree species identified in our study in the management of cabruca would be of considerable benefit to the long-term survival of lion tamarins.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the biological science, invertebrate (especially insect) diversity is relatively well known. Yet, little study about their interaction with specific land use or specific system function. With the rapid changes of landscape, biodiversity is also changes in response to human impact; due to each organism have the specific interaction with certain environment. In this research, the assessment of insect order in the different landscape types was conducted using several method of trapping to understand the specific pattern of insect which are inhabited the landscape. The objectives of this research were monitored the Insect diversity, its ecological importance to agro-forestry ecosystem, and compare it with other forest type in this area. Another objective was determined the insect characteristic as the indicator of environmental quality on each land-use system (forest, agroforestry, plantation and monoculture). Monoculture agriculture has the largest number of Lepidoptera and Hemiptera order (herbivore insect dominated) while in agro-forest system has the largest number of Diptera and coleoptera order. Protected forest, plantation forest and agro-forestry showed the similar index number which shows the similar ecological services for the insect as their habitat. However, in the monoculture agriculture, there was an unbalance insect composition and high dominance.

M3  - Article
AB  - The management of food plants by traditional communities is crucial for biodiversity conservation, especially in locations where the unique biota has a high level of endemism. There are many factors responsible for changes on the local landscape during the years of 1966 to 2011. We discuss how protected areas (Picinguaba Nucleus of the Serra do Mar State Park and Bocaina National Park) and the traditional smallholder farmers' (caicaras) management affected this scenario. We assume that continuous and in situ use of food plants are key factors for maintaining local biodiversity and we point out other drivers acting on this socioecological system, which is analyzed on this research. We collected data through participant observation, questionnaires and interviews. We used geoprocessing tools for linking landscape distinction emic criteria with phytosociological aspects, forest cover and diversity. These factors indicate that caicara farmers should have a voice in decisions related to biodiversity conservation in both parks.

TI  - Pollination of Coffea canephora in relation to local and regional agroforestry management
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee, and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal conditions for pollinators.2. We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee species.3. The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest, whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms.4. Fruit set of open pollinated flowers (as opposed to manually cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95%) than a species-poor bee community of six species (70% fruit set).5. Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee assemblage.6. Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee. This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage different species of bees through simple management measures such as growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems (< 500 m) so that forest-nesting social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the flowers.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of plant and animal biodiversity indicators in tropical forest and agroforest habitats
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - P>1. Biodiversity data are needed for conservation and management of tropical habitats, but the high diversity of these ecosystems makes comprehensive surveys prohibitively expensive and indicator taxa reflecting the biodiversity patterns of other taxa are frequently used. Few studies have produced the necessary comprehensive data sets to assess the quality of the indicator groups, however, and only one previous study has considered the monetary costs involved in sampling them.2. We surveyed four plant groups (herbs, liverworts, trees, lianas) and eight animal groups (ants, canopy and dung beetles, birds, butterflies, bees, wasps and the parasitoids of the latter two) in 15 plots of 50 x 50 m2 each, representing undisturbed rainforest and two types of cacao agroforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We calculated three biodiversity measures (alpha and beta diversity; percentage of species indicative of habitat conditions), built simple and multiple regression models among species groups (single groups, combinations of 2-11 groups, averaged relative diversity of all 12 groups), and related these to three measures of survey cost (absolute costs and two approaches correcting for different sampling intensities).3. Determination coefficients (R2 values) of diversity patterns between single study groups were generally low (< 0 center dot 25), while the consideration of several study groups increased R2 values to up to 0 center dot 8 for combinations of four groups, and to almost 1 center dot 0 for combinations of 11 groups. Survey costs varied 10-fold between study groups, but their cost-effectiveness (indicator potential versus monetary cost) varied strongly depending on the biodiversity aspect taken into account (alpha or beta diversity, single or multiple groups, etc.).4. Synthesis and applications. We found that increasing the number of taxa resulted in best overall biodiversity indication. We thus propose that the most cost-efficient approach to general tropical biodiversity inventories is to increase taxonomic coverage by selecting taxa with the lowest survey costs.

TI  - Depletion of soil organic carbon and nitrogen under Pinus taeda plantations in Southern Brazilian grasslands (Campos)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishment of pine (Pinus spp.) plantations on grasslands could increase carbon (C) sequestration to counteract increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. In the grasslands of the southern Brazilian highland (Campos), large areas have been converted to Pinus plantations over the last 30 years. In order to assess the impact of this land-use change on the amount and composition of soil organic matter (SOM), we investigated a grassland pasture site (G), and both an 8-year-old (P8) and a 30-year-old (P30) plantation with Pinus taeda. Soil samples down to 45 cm were analysed for texture, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N-tot) concentrations. Chemical composition of SOM was determined by using cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) C-13 NMR spectroscopy. We analysed for stable C isotope (delta C-13) and assessed the lignin composition by CuO oxidation. Additionally, contents of pyrogenic organic material (PyOM) were determined because the Campos is regularly burnt. Both pine plantations revealed relatively small SOC concentrations in the mineral soil of 72.6 mg g(-1) (P8) and 56.8 mg g(-1) (P30) and N-tot concentrations of 4.0 mg g(-1) (P8) and 2.9 mg g(-1) (P30) for the A horizon, while grassland showed significantly (P < 0.01) larger contents of 100.2 mg g(-1) for SOC and 5.9 mg g(-1) for N-tot. Accumulation of litter layers suggests decreased input of organic material into the mineral soil under pine, which was confirmed by the delta C-13 values and lignin composition. Smaller contents of vanillyl- (V), syringyl- (S), and cinnamyl (C)-phenols, smaller ratios of S/V and C/V, and smaller ratios of acidic to aldehydic forms of V and S phenols indicated a high degree of decomposition of residual grass-derived SOM in the upper part of the mineral soil (0-10 cm) under pine plantations. This was confirmed by CPMAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy, showing an increasing Alkyl C/O-Alkyl C ratio at the same depth. No significant changes in the contents of PyOM could be detected, but all sites tended to show the greatest concentrations at deeper soil depths > 15 cm, indicating a vertical relocation of PyOM. The results suggest that decomposition of residual SOM originating from grassland species contributes to the decrease of SOC and N-tot and to an acidification in the topsoil under pine plantations. We also suggest that slow litter decomposition and incorporation and the absence of fires at the plantations are additional reasons for the reduced amount of SOM. Depletion of SOM and the acidification of the topsoil may reduce the availability and supply of nutrients and diminish the C sequestration potential of the mineral soil.

TI  - Diversified crop rotations increase the yield and economic efficiency of grain production systems
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotations with high plant diversity and biomass input have been recognized worldwide as a crucial practice for increasing the sustainability of grain production systems, particularly in regions under no-tillage (NT) management. Nonetheless, low-diversity grain production systems based on double cropping (two crops in the same agricultural year) repeated over time, including soybean followed by maize (known in Brazil as "second crop maize ") or wheat, remain prevalent in Brazil. The continuous use of these systems can impair soil yield capacity, farmers' profits, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the grain yield and profitability of different production systems with different levels of plant diversity. This study was based on results obtained during the 2009-2017 cropping seasons through a long-term field trial conducted under NT since 1985 in southern Brazil. The trial covered two 4-year agricultural cycles with two crops per year, resulting in eight crops per cycle and 16 crops over the entire period. The experiment followed a randomized complete block design, with five treatments and four replicates. The treatments involved three diversified crop rotations, comprising different cover crops and two double-crop systems (wheat-soybean and maize-soybean). For a given agricultural year, wheat and cover crops (white oats, black oats, and forage radish) were grown from May to September, and the second crop maize was grown from March to August. Soybean and first crop maize were grown during the summer from October to February. The grain yield, gross revenue, production cost, and cumulative profit were analyzed for each production system. Gross revenue and profit were primarily estimated based on the actual annual average commodity prices received by farmers, and two additional price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) were proposed considering the average prices from 2010 to 2017. Regardless of the cropping season, first crop maize and wheat grain yields were higher in diversified crop rotations. The production system only affected the second crop maize yield in 2010/2011, with a higher value obtained in a diversified crop rotation system. The soybean yield in diversified crop rotations was higher than that in double crop systems. Considering each cash crop separately, soybean produced the highest average profit (US$ 472.50 ha(-1)), followed by the first crop maize (US$ 245.31 ha(-1)) and wheat (US$ 77.71 ha(-1)), whereas the second crop maize led to economic losses (-US$ 121.73 ha(-1)). All diversified crop rotations produced a higher 8-year cumulative profit and gross margin than the maize-soybean in double-crop system. The relative economic performance of production systems remained unchanged under alternative price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) compared with that under the observed (actual) price scenario. However, the cumulative profit of maize and soybean in double-crop system was the most negatively impacted in the pessimistic scenario (-45.9%), indicating greater economic risk. Overall, lack of direct revenues from cover crops were compensated by increased grain yield in the spring-summer season and profitability of diversified crop rotation systems. Therefore, diversified crop rotation systems are economically competitive with double crop systems, rendering them feasible management options for conserving natural resources and increasing crop resilience to adverse climatic conditions.

TI  - Landscape constraints on functional diversity of birds and insects in tropical agroecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyzeatabases on birds and insects to assess patterns of functional diversity in human-dominated landscapes in the tropics. A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common. Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats. This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning.

TI  - A scientometrics analysis of silvopastoral systems: what we know and what we need to know?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are a sustainable alternative to reduce livestock environmental impacts and restore degraded pastures due to their higher diversity, increased forage production and quality, enhanced soil quality, and C storage. Legume-based silvopastoral systems also contribute through biological nitrogen fixation by the legume component. In this study we evaluate the scientific production on the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2022, with a two-step process. First the keywords "silvopastoral systems" were used for an initial analysis of the overall literature, followed by "legume" or "enzym*" or "microbial communit*, yielding more than 870 papers. The number of publications grew exponentially during the period evaluated, and between 2019 and 2022, approximately 63% of all publications occurred. Brazil had the largest number of published articles, followed by Mexico, USA, Spain, and Colombia. There was also a network of collaborations between institutions in these countries. Agriculture is the research area with the most published articles, with the most studied topics being management, biodiversity, and nutrient dynamics and cycling, especially carbon and nitrogen. However, only nine of these studied the soil microbial community and five, the soil enzymatic activity. Although these previous studies have observed the effect of SPS on important soil indicators, how SPS is used as a restoration tool to affect the microbial biomass and activity of extracellular enzymes remains poorly understood and is important to validate the regeneration strategies. Thus, this article analyzes the evolution of publications on this agroecosystem to advance the knowledge and sustainability in those segments that are still little studied, such as the microbial community and soil enzymatic activity.

TI  - Pedofauna diversity in traditional and agroforestry systems of the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the impact of agricultural management on soil invertebrates is still a challenge to research in the area of soil ecology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity, richness, abundance and uniformity of the pedofauna in areas of traditional agroforestry systems involving burning (with intensive use, and after six and nine years of fallow) and a less-impacted system (BUSH) in the semi-arid region of Brazil. To do this, pitfall traps were installed along five transects in each system, and pedofauna diversity was analysed over seven consecutive days in the dry and rainy seasons. The collected invertebrates were classified into taxonomic groups, and their diversity, richness, abundance and uniformity were studied. During the dry season, the agroforestry systems showed low pedofauna diversity and uniformity, but with a richness similar to that of the BUSH system, whereas the traditional systems with fallow periods of six and nine years presented high diversity and uniformity. During the rainy season, the agroforestry systems had similar pedofauna abundance and richness compared to the BUSH system. The traditional fallow systems showed an abundance, richness, diversity and uniformity similar to the results under the BUSH system. Compared to the other areas, the traditional systems showed the greatest abundance and a similar richness, but less diversity and uniformity. When water is available, agroforestry systems support a diversity and uniformity of pedofauna similar to the less-impacted system.

T2  - Boletim do Museu de Biologia Mello Leitao Nova Serie
M3  - Article
AB  - Socioenvironmental and epidemiologic characterization of the human populations from two protected areas of Santa Teresa, ES: subsidies for public policies for conservation and health. This article presents some aspects of the social, environmental, economic, demographic and health situation of the populations living around two protected areas (APs) in the municipality of Santa Teresa, ES, the Estacao Biologica de Santa Lucia (EBSL) and the Reserva Biologica Augusto Ruschi (RBAR). Considering that only about 5% to 8% of the original Atlantic Forest coverage is still preserved but subject to intense human predation, it is fundamental that efforts be developed to improve the knowledge about the groups inhabiting this ecosystem, especially those living in the surroundings of protected areas. Sixty one families living around the RBAR and 28 around the EBSL were investigated, representing over 90% of the residents in the two areas. The socioenvironmental and health situation of some families put them in serious social danger, and many use the natural resources in inadequate manners what may lead to negative repercussion in their health and in the protected areas such as loss of biodiversity, intensification of the border effect and contamination of the water table by pesticides. The data presented may help in the planning and implementation of public policies aiming to promote a more rational use of the soil around the protected areas, more protection of the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest and improvement in the health situation of the rural populations of Espirito Santo state.

TI  - Integrating climate change into agroforestry conservation: A case study on native plant species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Designing multispecies systems with suitable climatic affinity and identifying species' vulnerability under human-driven climate change are current challenges to achieve successful adaptation of natural systems. To address this problem, we need to (1) identify groups of species with climatic similarity under climate scenarios and (2) identify areas with high conservation value under predicted climate change.2. To recognize species with similar climatic niche requirements that can be grouped for mixed cropping in Brazil, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs) and Spearman's. for overlap. We also used prioritization algorithms to map areas of high conservation value using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP3-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) to assess mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2080) climate change impacts.3. We identified 15 species groups with finer climatic affinities at different times depicted on hierarchical clustering dendrograms, which can be combined into agroecological agroforestry systems. Furthermore, we highlight the climatically suitable areas for these groups of species, thus providing an outlook of where different species will need to be planted over time to be conserved. In addition, we observed that climate change is predicted to modify the spatial association of these groups under different future climate scenarios, causing a mean negative change in species climatic similarity of 9.5% to 13.7% under SSP2-4.5 scenario and 9.5% to 10.5% under SSP5-8.5, for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080, respectively.4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide a framework for agroforestry conservation. The groups of species with finer climatic affinities identified and the climatically suitable areas can be combined into agroecological productive systems, and provide an outlook of where different species may be planted over time. In addition, the conservation priority zones displaying high climate stability for each species individually and all at once can be incorporated into Brazil's conservation plans by policymakers to prioritize specific sites. Lastly, we urge policymakers, conservation organizations and donors to promote interventions involving farmers and local communities, since the species' evaluated have proven to maintain landscapes with productive forest fragments and can be conserved in different Brazilian ecosystems.

TI  - Tradeoffs between income, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning during tropical rainforest conversion and agroforestry intensification
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning due to rainforest destruction and agricultural intensification are prime concerns for science and society alike. Potentially, ecosystems show nonlinear responses to land-use intensification that would open management options with limited ecological losses but satisfying economic gains. However, multidisciplinary studies to quantify ecological losses and socioeconomic tradeoffs under different management options are rare. Here, we evaluate opposing land use strategies in cacao agroforestry in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by using data on species richness of nine plant and animal taxa, six related ecosystem functions, and on socioeconomic drivers of agroforestry expansion. Expansion of cacao cultivation by 230% in the last two decades was triggered not only by economic market mechanisms, but also by rarely considered cultural factors. Transformation from near-primary forest to agroforestry had little effect on overall species richness, but reduced plant biomass and carbon storage by approximate to 75% and species richness of forest-using species by approximate to 60%. In contrast, increased land use intensity in cacao agroforestry, coupled with a reduction in shade tree cover from 80% to 40%, caused only minor quantitative changes in biodiversity and maintained high levels of ecosystem functioning while doubling farmers' net income. However, unshaded systems further increased income by approximate to 40%, implying that current economic incentives and cultural preferences for new intensification practices put shaded systems at risk. We conclude that low-shade agroforestry provides the best available compromise between economic forces and ecological needs. Certification schemes for shade-grown crops may provide a market-based mechanism to slow down current intensification trends.

TI  - How bamboo influences the seed bank and biotic and abiotic factors of a Brazilian tropical forest
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a knowledge gap regarding the influence of bamboos on natural regeneration. This study evaluated how abundance, richness, dominance, evenness, diversity of the seed bank and biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., canopy opening, herbaceous cover, and litter thickness), differ between bamboo dominated (B) and non-dominated (NB) areas. The study was conducted in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest surrounded by an agricultural landscape. Soil samples were taken at 20 points in each area at two time periods, to evaluate the seed bank. The results show that diversity and structural parameters of the seed bank differ between areas and time periods. There was higher abundance and richness of seedlings of herbaceous ruderal species in area B and a greater abundance of seedlings of arboreal species in area NB. Sampling points in the bamboo dominated area had greater canopy openings and greater cover by herbaceous species, facilitating the establishment of individuals belonging to the families Poaceae and Cyperaceae, which could have competitive advantages over other species of the regenerating community. Considering that bamboo can affect the seed bank, long-term studies are needed to understand successional dynamics and evaluate suitable management actions to conserve the diversity in remaining forests.

TI  - The contribution of cacao agroforests to the conservation of lower canopy ant and beetle diversity in Indonesia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests has increased the interest in the potential value of tropical agroforests for the conservation of biodiversity. Traditional, shaded agroforests may support high levels of biodiversity, for some groups even approaching that of undisturbed tropical forests. However, it is unclear to what extent forest fauna is represented in this diversity and how management affects forest fauna in agroforests. We studied lower canopy ant and beetle fauna in cacao agroforests and forests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a region dominated by cacao agroforestry. We compared ant and beetle species richness and composition in forests and cacao agroforests and studied the impact of two aspects of management intensification (the decrease in shade tree diversity and in shade canopy cover) on ant and beetle diversity. The agroforests had three types of shade that represented a decrease in tree diversity (high, intermediate and low diversity). Species richness of ants and beetles in the canopies of the cacao trees was similar to that found in lower canopy forest trees. However, the composition of ant and beetle communities differed greatly between the agroforest and forest sites. Forest beetles suffered profoundly from the conversion to agroforests: only 12.5% of the beetle species recorded in the forest sites were also found in the agroforests and those species made up only 5% of all beetles collected from cacao. In contrast, forest ants were well represented in agroforests, with 75% of all species encountered in the forest sites also occurring on cacao. The reduction of shade tree diversity had no negative effect on ants and beetles on cacao trees. Beetle abundances and non-forest ant species richness even increased with decreasing shade tree diversity. Thinning of the shade canopy was related to a decrease in richness of forest ant species on cacao trees but not of beetles. The contrasting responses of ants and beetles to shade tree management emphasize that conservation plans that focus on one taxonomic group may not work for others. Overall ant and beetle diversity can remain high in shaded agroforests but the conservation of forest ants and beetles in particular depends primarily on the protection of natural forests, which for forest ants can be complemented by the conservation of adjacent shaded cacao agroforests.

AB  - Tectona grandis L. (teak) is one of the cherished heritage tropical hardwood species that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a large deciduous tree native to India, Myanmar and Thailand. The natural populations of teak remain an important source from the economic, ecological and environmental perspectives. Teak timber is well known for its quality in terms of durability and market value. It is naturally resistant to various biotic stress components due to the presence of tectoquinone, lapachol and deoxy lapachol; however, it takes a minimum of 20-25 years for the production of marketable wood to fetch high returns. This long haul provides sufficient time for pests and diseases to feast upon teak at various growth stages starting from nursery to timber mills which leads to a downturn in timber production. To meet the rising demand from wood industries, it is essential to manage the health of the teak plantation outside forests. The reports of new pests and diseases on teak escalated since 2010, especially from countries like Brazil and Mexico where we witness recent rise in commercial teak forests, and this vulnerability emphasizes the deployment of protection measures right from the supply of quality planting material. The update on the biotic factors comprising insect pests, fungal and bacterial infections, which are currently limiting teak wood production, will supplement the efforts involved in quality planting material production. Identification of plus trees with genetic resistance, molecular characterization and monitoring of pests and diseases on teak harnessing the recent developments in plant protection, along with the research on development of the package of practices for teak nurseries and plantation management, will only sustain teak production in near future.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna in Differents Systems of Land Use Soil in Upper River Solimoes, AM, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mesofauna has an important function in the soil and it is represented mainly by Acari Oribatida and Collembola. We report the first data on the density and diversity of the soil mesofauna in Benjamin Constant, Amazonas State, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry system, cultivated areas and pastures. A total of 101 samples were collected 100 m apart from each other and specimens were collected by using Berlese-Tullgren method. The highest density was registered in secondary forest (29,776 specimens.m(-2)). Acari Oribatida was the dominant group (7.072 specimens.m(-2)) in the pasture, suggesting that mites show higher capacity of adaptation to disturbed environments and/or due to the presence of gregarious species. The density of Collembola (5,632 specimens.m(-2)) was higher in secondary forest. Formicidae was the dominant group (27,824 specimens.m(-2)) and its highest density occurred in the secondary forest (12,336 specimens.m-2). Seven species and ten morphospecies of Isoptera and three species of Symphyla were identified. The highest density and diversity were found in secondary forest. One supposes that the low density of mesofauna found in all of the studied systems is being influenced by soil structure and composition as well as litter volume. For SUT, the composition of taxonomic groups in the cultivated areas is similar to the one found in primary forest, while the groups found in the agroforestry system are similar to those in the pasture, which may help to decide on land use strategies.

TI  - Assessing Knowledge Production for Agrosilvopastoral Systems in South America
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades agroforestry has undergone significant development in Latin America. South America generates the most scientific research on the topic in the region. We conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of knowledge production for South American agroforestry that includes livestock grazing, known as agrosilvopastoralism (AS), examining how different sociopolitical factors such as sources of funding, institutional priorities, and international cooperation can bias the direction and objectives of scientific research. We assessed the major attributes of scientific publications on the topic (25 articles per country: overall n = 210) and the potential factors underlying the processes of research and development in the region. The tree component was the most studied, while the livestock component received less attention. Studies were mainly focused on the production of goods and services (monetary or nonmonetary approaches), except in Brazil, where conservation was the major study objective. Stakeholders were involved in more than half of the studies (60%), and they were mostly ranchers and local producers. More than half (70%) of the studies offered recommendations based on their results, and such recommendations were mostly concerned with the management of agrosilvopastoral system components. In general, studies were led just as often by local as foreign first authors and coauthored by more than three people as part of interinstitutional working groups. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile had more frequent cooperation among institutions and countries but mainly used their own funding. In contrast, Bolivia. Ecuador, and Peru had almost 100% of their studies supported by foreign countries (North America and Europe). Countries with greater internal funding of research generated more long-term studies. Besides this, two clear trends were detected: 1) conservation and social aspects were mainly supported by sources from external countries led by foreign principal investigators, and 2) production issues were supported from sources within countries and supported high levels of cooperation among institutions.

TI  - Frugivory by five bird species in agroforest home gardens of Pontal do Paranapanema, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inefficiency of conservation efforts based exclusively on natural habitat patches has called the attention of some conservationists to the matrix. Described as the major component of a landscape, the matrix is often agricultural, particularly in the tropics. In this context, agroforestry practices have been recognized for their ability to support a rich fauna and flora. Besides the extensive literature concerning bird communities in agroforestry systems, very few studies analyze how different species respond to the management of such practices. Our study describes the diet and habitat use frequency of five frugivorous bird species in agroforest home gardens, secondary forests, and pastures in the region of Pontal do Paranapanema, Brazil. The focal species were Ramphastos toco (Toco Toucan), Pteroglossus castanotis (Chestnut-eared Aracari), Amazona aestiva (Blue-fronted Amazon), Ara chloroptera (Green-winged Macaw), and Cyanocorax chrysops (Plush-crested Jay). We gathered both habitat use frequency and diet using the "feeding-bout" method. Overall frequency was higher in the secondary forest when compared to pasture and home gardens for all bird species except A. aestiva. The number of feeding bouts was higher in home gardens than in forests for all species with the exception of C. chrysops. Differences in monthly median feeding activity were only statistically significant for C. chrysops and for A. aestiva. The latter was the only species observed feeding in pasture habitats. The total number of food taxa was larger in home gardens than in the forest. Our results reinforce the importance of agroforestry systems as a resource-rich habitat for frugivorous birds.

TI  - NATIVE AMAZONIAN FUNGI TO CONTROL TERMITES Nasutitermes sp. (BLATTODEA: TERMITIDAE)
T2  - ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Termites of the Nasutitermes genus are considered one of the main urban and agroforestry pests in Brazil, where the main method of control is the application of pesticides. The uso of entomopathogenic fungi to reduce the population of this plague in the environment could be use as an alternative. The goal of this study was to evaluate the virulence of isolates native Amazonian fungi belonging to the Tolypocladium endophyticum, Metarhizium anisopliae and Metarhizium marquandii species for the control of Nasutitermes sp. The strains of T. endophyticum (4.439), M. anisopliae (4.443) and M. marquandii (4.472) with their respective isolation codes, were evaluated using suspensions at concentrations of 105, 106, 107 and 108 conidia/mL against the termites. The fungi were characterized to species level by molecular analysis. The greatest virulence was registered with T. endophyticum (4.439), with a mortality of 100 % on the 4th day of treatment for all analyzed concentrations. The M. anisopliae strain (4.443) proved to be efficient, causing a mortality of 100 % on the 7th and 6th days at dilutions of 107 and 108 conidia/mL, respectively. Rates lower than 100 % were registered with M. marquandii (4.472). Therefore, the three fungal strains showed virulence against the termites Nasutitermes sp. In this study, the fungi Tolypocladium endophyticum and Metarhizium marquandii are reported for the first time for the biological control of pests, indicating the potential of native Amazonian fungi for the biological control of thermites Nasutitermes sp.

TI  - Influence of crop management practices on bean foliage arthropods
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop management practices can affect the population of phytophagous pest species and beneficial arthropods with consequences for integrated pest management. In this study, we determined the effect of no-tillage and crop residue management on the arthropod community associated with the canopy of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Abundance and species composition of herbivorous, detritivorous, predaceous and parasitoid arthropods were recorded during the growing seasons of 2003 and 2004 in Coimbra County, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Arthropod diversity and guild composition were similar among crop management systems, but their abundance was higher under no-tillage relative to conventional cultivation and where residues from the preceding crop were maintained in the field. Thirty-four arthropod species were recorded, and those most representative of the impact of the crop management practices were Hypogastrura springtails, Empoasca kraemeri and Circulifer leafhoppers, and Solenopsis ants. The infestation levels of major insect-pests, especially leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), was on average seven-fold lower under no-tillage with retention of crop residues relative to the conventional system with removal of residues, whereas the abundance of predatory ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and springtails (Collembola: Hypogastruridae) were, respectively, about seven-and 15-fold higher in that treatment. Importantly, a significant trophic interaction among crop residues, detritivores, predators and herbivores was observed. Plots managed with no-tillage and retention of crop residues had the highest bean yield, while those with conventional cultivation and removal of the crop residues yielded significantly less beans. This research shows that cropping systems that include zero tillage and crop residue retention can reduce infestation by foliar insect-pests and increase abundance of predators and detritivores, thus having direct consequences for insect pest management.

TI  - The invasive Yellow Crazy Ant and the decline of forest ant diversity in Indonesian cacao agroforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout the tropics, agroforests are often the only remaining habitat with a considerable tree cover. Agroforestry systems can support high numbers of species and are therefore frequently heralded as the future for tropical biodiversity conservation. However, anthropogenic habitat modification can facilitate species invasions that may suppress native fauna. We compared the ant fauna of lower canopy trees in natural rainforest sites with that of cacao trees in agroforests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia in order to assess the effects of agroforestry on occurrence of the Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes, a common invasive species in the area, and its effects on overall ant richness. The agroforests differed in the type of shade-tree composition, tree density, canopy cover, and distance to the village. On average, 43% of the species in agroforests also occurred in the lower canopy of nearby primary forest and the number of forest ant species that occurred on cacao trees was not related to agroforestry characteristics. However, A. gracilipes was the most common non-forest ant species, and forest ant richness decreased significantly with the presence of this species. Our results indicate that agroforestry may have promoted the occurrence of A. gracilipes, possibly because tree management in agroforests negatively affects ant species that depend on trees for nesting and foraging, whereas A. gracilipes is a generalist when it comes to nesting sites and food preference. Thus, agroforestry management that includes the thinning of tree stands can facilitate ant invasions, thereby threatening the potential of cultivated land for the conservation of tropical ant diversity.

TI  - PHYSICAL QUALITY OF AN OXISOL UNDER AN INTEGRATED CROP-LIVESTOCK-FOREST SYSTEM IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil physical quality is an important factor for the sustainability of agricultural systems. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate soil physical properties and soil organic carbon in a Typic Acrudox under an integrated crop-livestock-forest system. The experiment was carried out in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Treatments consisted of seven systems: integrated crop-livestock-forest, with 357 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 30 cm (CLF357-30); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 357 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 45 cm (CLF357-45); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 227 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 30 cm (CLF227-30); integrated crop-livestock-forest with 227 trees ha(-1) and pasture height of 45 cm (CLF227-45); integrated crop-livestock with pasture height of 30 cm (CL30); integrated crop-livestock with pasture height of 45 cm (CL45) and native vegetation (NV). Soil properties were evaluated for the depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm. All grazing treatments increased bulk density (rho(b)) and penetration resistance (PR), and decreased total porosity (f(t)) and macroporosity (f(ma)), compared to NV. The values of rho(b) (1.18-1.47 Mg m(-3)), f(ma) (0.14-0.17 m(3) m(-3)) and PR (0.62-0.81 MPa) at the 0-10 cm depth were not restrictive to plant growth. The change in land use from NV to CL or CLF decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and the soil organic carbon pool (SOCpool). All grazing treatments had a similar SOCpool at the 0-10 cm depth and were lower than that for NV (17.58 Mg ha(-1)).

TI  - Revegetation process increases the diversity of total and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in areas affected by the Fundao dam failure in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities have environmental impacts. The rupture of the Fundao tailing dam ejected a significant volume of iron ore mining waste (IOMW) and was characterized as the greatest disaster in mining history. The use of microorganisms to monitor the affected soils is ideal due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity for soil remediation, as they can promote plant growth under stressed conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the total fungi diversity and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community structure of the area affected by IOMW that is currently under rehabilitation. Soil and root samples were collected from an impacted site without rehabilitation (REC1), two revegetated areas with grass and leguminous species (REC2 and REC3), and one reference area in the undisturbed forest (UND) during two seasons (rainy and dry). The total fungal diversity was analyzed by next generation sequencing. The AMF was identified morphologically and the number of spores, colonization, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were identified for this group of fungi. Total fungi diversity, AMF community structure, and soil chemical indicators differed among areas and between seasons. UND exhibited the highest organic matter content whereas rehabilitated areas were more affected by pH and presented higher values. The total fungal diversity and AMF community structure in REC areas showed that spore number and species richness increased along with the revegetation process. Glomus and Rhizophagus comprised the most abundant genera. In both climate seasons, AMF diversity in UND was higher than in REC areas but increased diversity in REC was observed in subsequent sampling. The fungal community diversity in affected areas was altered by the revegetation process-which increased the total fungal diversity-as well as AMF helping the recovery of this area.

TI  - Legacy Effects Overshadow Tree Diversity Effects on Soil Fungal Communities in Oil Palm-Enrichment Plantations
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Financially profitable large-scale cultivation of oil palm monocultures in previously diverse tropical rain forest areas constitutes a major ecological crisis today. Not only is a large proportion of the aboveground diversity lost, but the belowground soil microbiome, which is important for the sustainability of soil function, is massively altered. Intermixing oil palms with native tree species promotes vegetation biodiversity and stand structural complexity in plantations, but the impact on soil fungi remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the diversity and community composition of soil fungi three years after tree diversity enrichment in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). We tested the effects of tree diversity, stand structural complexity indices, and soil abiotic conditions on the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. We hypothesized that the enrichment experiment alters the taxonomic and functional community composition, promoting soil fungal diversity. Fungal community composition was affected by soil abiotic conditions (pH, N, and P), but not by tree diversity and stand structural complexity indices. These results suggest that intensive land use and abiotic filters are a legacy to fungal communities, overshadowing the structuring effects of the vegetation, at least in the initial years after enrichment plantings.

AB  - We analysed species diversity of epiphytic bryophytes in different land use types in tropical America (Bolivia, Ecuador Costa Rica) and Indonesia (Sulawesi) including natural rain forests secondary rain forests fallows, isolated pasture trees and cacao agroforests Changes in species richness from the natural forest towards the modified habitats varied greatly from 0-10% species loss in old secondary forest to 65-80 % in young fallows and cacao agroforest Species turnover was more constant with forest species losses varying from 30-40% in old regenerating forests to 75% in fallows and cacao agroforests The low percentage of forest species in cacao agroforest suggests that these agroforests are of minor conservation importance for bryophytes In contrast remnant forest trees in pastures are a rich habitat for bryophytes and may play an important role in then conservation in ale is where the rain forest has been converted Life forms proportions were considerably affected by land use change in submontane forest areas but not at higher montane elevation As expected shade epiphytes were replaced by sun epiphytes in the drier landuse types Canopy closure, microclimate and host tree characteristics were identified as principal drivers of epiphytic bryophyte diversity in the different land use types The results support the notion that preservation of canopy cover is crucial to the conservation of tropical rain forest biodiversity The results also confirmed that recovery of bryophyte diversity in regenerating tropical rain forest following clear cutting is a very slow process and may take more than one hunched years

TI  - Tradeoffs to manage sustainable systems of grain production in tropical soils
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term sustainability of intensive cropping systems in tropical soils depends on strategies to reconcile grain output, cover crops to maximize biomass yield for soil mulching, and maintaining soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study, we evaluated spatiotemporal constraints underpinning the diversification from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) monoculture under conventional tillage (CT) or no-tillage (NT) and soybean in succession with maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping (NTS3) to the use of millet (Pennisetum glaucum L., NTS1) and brachiaria (Brachiaria ruziziensis (R.Germ. & Evrard) Crins, NTS2) in successions or millet, crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis Roth.), and maize+brachiaria in rotations in a 12-year field experiment in an Oxisol. We quantified total grain output, total biomass production, and SOC contents and stocks (0-40 cm depth). Over 12 years, cumulative grain output under the double cropping (NTS3) was 135.0 Mg ha(-1), with soybean-maize proportions of 35-65 %. Thus, the successions NTS1 and NTS2 would reduce maize grain output relative to NTS3 (7.3 Mg h(-1) year(-1)). Under the rotations, reduction in soybean and maize grain output relative to NTS3 was about 1.4 and 4.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Biomass production under NTS3 was 12.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) but reached 15.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) under the rotation including summer soybean (1st and 2nd years) and off-season crotalaria (1st year) or maize+brachiria (2nd year), and only brachiaria (3rd year). Under this rotation, changes in SOC stocks were +2.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for the 0-40 cm depth layer, whereas under NTS3 it was +1.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), relative to the native Cerrrado. For soybean monoculture under CT or NT changes in SOC were about-0.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) relative to the native Cerrado. Overall, despite the reduced total grain output, the rotation system proposed may be critical to reconcile sustainable food security, soil protection by mulching and SOC maintenance in agricultural Cerrado soils.

TI  - Organic fertilization influences nematode diversity and maturity index in coffee tree plantations using an agroforestry system
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In conventional coffee farming, soil fauna can be negatively affected by the intensive management practices adopted and the use of an agroforestry system (AFS) is an alternative to reduce these impacts. In coffee AFS, soil nutrition is provided mainly using organic fertilizers. This soil management favors the microbiota and can alter the population dynamics of some organisms. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of organic fertilizers on the nematode community in coffee AFS and to determine their impact on soil ecology. Soil samples were collected from three coffee AFS and a nearby Atlantic rainforest fragment. Nematodes were extracted from the samples and identified to the genus. The identified populations were compared using several community and diversity indices to determine the environmental conditions of the systems under evaluation. No differences in total abundance among nematode communities were found in the four areas evaluated. Regarding trophic groups, the coffee AFS treated with either cow manure or poultry litter favored the trophic group of bacterivores. Plant-parasitic nematodes were more abundant in soils of both the naturally fertilized coffee AFS and the Atlantic rainforest fragment. The maturity and structural indexes indicated that the Atlantic rainforest fragment and the naturally fertilized coffee AFS had similar ecological functions. On the other hand, soils fertilized with cow manure were less diverse, had higher dominance in the community, and showed less ecological stability. The nematode communities found in the AFS were similar to those seen in the forest fragment indicating that is possible to produce coffee sustainably without negatively affecting soil quality.

TI  - Evaluation of soil conditions in fast-growing plantations of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium in Brazil:: a contribution to the study of sustainable land use
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is a comparison of the holorganic horizons (L and F) and hemiorganic horizons (AI > and A12) of 7-years-old stands of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia rnangium, in the region of the Tabuleiro Forest, in Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. In the soil under A. mangiutn, the stocks of organic matter in the L and F horizons were higher, and the C/N ratio was lower, due to the high nitrogen content of the leaf material. The same was observed for the A horizon chemical properties: the C and nutrients concentrations of the soil fine fraction were higher under A. mangium. The comparison of the C and nutrient concentrations between the A(11) and A(12) horizons and between the aggregate fraction and fine fraction showed similar trends in both sites. In both plantations, the C and nutrient concentrations were higher in A(11) than in A12 horizons, and the soil aggregate fraction had higher concentration of nutrients than the soil fine fraction. Nevertheless, the percentage of aggregates in the soil matrix was much higher in A. mangium than in E. grandis. These results show that in this superficially sandy soil (Argissolo Amarelo Distrofico - Ultisol), the organic matter is the most important way of keeping nutrients, and that the aggregate fraction can be the most effective way of avoiding nutrient loss to the deeper soil horizons. In this context, A. mangium provides better conditions for restoring the soil fertility and soil biodiversity, thus providing better sustainability of the cropping systems than E. grandis.

AB  - This study aims to examine farmer's socio-economic characteristics and pepper farming analysis on several pepper management patterns. This study was conducted in Lawonua Village, South Konawe District, and Simbune Village, East Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, in June 2014 and November 2015. Data were collected through a survey method using open-ended and semi-structured questionnaire interviews, in-depth interviews, and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Data were analyzed using qualitative descriptive and financial analysis, such as NPV, BCR, and IRR. The results showed that most income of the community in Simbune and Lawonua Village is from pepper farming activity. The respondents were dominated by men, where most of them are Tolaki Tribe, with average age ranges from 30-50 years old. Education level was dominated by junior and senior high school, and most of the respondents have more than ten years of pepper farming experience. The analysis showed that all pepper pattern management was feasible. The results indicated that the first pattern of monoculture pepper farming provided the highest NPV IDR 379,175,999 (IDR/rotation), and the second-highest was pepper farming with cocoa, which provided the highest BCR values (2.75). While the third was agroforestry pepper patterns with pepper, cocoa, durian, and langsat that had the highest IRR value of 33%. The pepper with the cocoa farming pattern was generally carried out by farmers who have enough capital. While pepper farming in the agroforestry pattern was mostly chosen due to its consideration to provide more security for family income.

TI  - Agroforestry benefit zones:: A tool for the conservation and management of Atlantic forest fragments, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Atlantic forests of Brazil exist largely as remnants in an agricultural landscape, but they are still key reservoirs of biological diversity, Forest fragments are often the only remaining repositories of the biological information needed to guide successful restoration of this endangered ecosystem. These fragments also support the last wild populations of the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus [Mikan]), one of the most endangered primates in the world, as well as other vulnerable and valuable plant species. Activities of local landless people who reside adjacent to the forest are currently depleting the biodiversity of forest fragments. Fires, cattle grazing, and spread of invasive grasses have caused a gradual but continuous erosion of forest biodiversity. Human encroachment affects forest structure and causes loss of many plant and animal species, mainly through edge effects. We present an approach to establish agroforestry benefit zones around forest fragments as a tool for the conservation of Atlantic forest remnants. Both the remaining forests and local farmers benefit from the establishment of agroforestry green belts. A vital aspect of these benefit zones is the use of multipurpose trees and shrubs to provide an insulative/protective zone around fragments, mitigating edge effects. Implicit in this conservation approach are the assumptions that stimulating planting and use of multipurpose trees and shrubs in edge areas places a value on these resources, and that this value will help pave the way to the conservation of forests and wildlife in the Atlantic forest region.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi occurrence in revegetated areas after bauxite mining at Porto Trombetas, Para State, Brazil
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in revegetated areas at Porto Trombetas, Para, Brazil. Composite samples were collected in August (dry season) and April (wet season) in areas with top soil after 2, 4, 6, 12 and 16 years of revegetation, in area without the top soil or vegetation, and in a pristine forest. The AMF spores were extracted, and the species identified. The relative density and frequency of occurrence of each species, the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indexes were calculated. The results indicated that the density of AMF spores did not differ significantly with season. However, the number of AMF species was significantly higher in the dry season at the pristine forest and in the area two years after revegetation. Among the AMF species, Glomus macrocarpum and Acaulospora mellea were represented in higher numbers. After two years of planting, the diversity was highest and the dominance of AMF species was lowest. The addition of top soil with the planting of mycorthizal seedlings were efficient to colonize areas with AMF after open cast bauxite mining.

TI  - Ferns, frogs, lizards, birds and bats in forest fragments and shade cacao plantations in two contrasting landscapes in the Atlantic forest, Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional shade cacao plantations (cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil, are biologically rich habitats, encompassing many forest-dwelling species. However, a critical question for the conservation management of this specific region, and the highly fragmented Atlantic forest in general, is to what extent the conservation value of cabrucas relies on the presence of primary forest habitat in the landscape. We investigated the relative importance of cabrucas and forests for the conservation of five diverse biological groups (ferns, frogs, lizards, birds and bats) in two contrasting landscapes in southern Bahia, one dominated by forest with some interspersed cabrucas, and one dominated by cabrucas with interspersed forest fragments. The community structure (richness, abundance and diversity) of all biological groups differed between cabrucas and forests, although these differences varied among groups. A high number of forest species was found in the cabrucas. However, there were pronounced differences between the two landscapes with regard to the ability of cabrucas to maintain species richness. Irrespective of the biological group considered, cabrucas located in the landscape with few and small forest fragments supported impoverished assemblages compared to cabrucas located in the landscape with high forest cover. This suggests that a greater extent of native forest in the landscape positively influences the species richness of cabrucas. In the landscape with few small forest fragments interspersed into extensive areas of shade cacao plantations, the beta diversity of birds was higher than in the more forested landscape, suggesting that forest specialist species that rarely ventured into cabrucas were randomly lost from the fragments. These results stress both the importance and the vulnerability of the small forest patches remaining in landscapes dominated by shade plantations. They also point to the need to preserve sufficient areas of primary habitat even in landscapes where land use practices are generally favorable to the conservation of biodiversity.

Biodiversitas 24: 4470-4484. Some rural West Java ecosystems have a high bird species diversity because they have forests, bamboo talun, mixed gardens, rice fields, and homegardens. Rapid population expansion, illicit bird shooting, forest degradation and conversion, and pesticide pollution have reduced rural bird species diversity. This study examined bird diversity in natural forests, coffee agroforestry, vegetable gardens, and bird hunting. Quantitative and qualitative research were used. The point count approach investigates bird species and populations, whereas detailed interviews with knowledgeable informants are used to study bird hunting. In natural forests, vegetable gardens, and coffee agroforestry, 67 species from 39 bird groups were found. The bird species diversity index in three habitats: vegetable garden (H'=2.59), coffee agroforestry (H'=2.97), and natural forest (H'=2.96). Based on the Sorensen Similarity Index, bird species in in vegetable garden and coffee agroforestry, vegetable garden and natural forest, and coffee agroforestry and natural forest had a similarity index of 31.03%, 22.22%, and 52.05%, respectively. These findings suggest that bird species may prefer coffee agroforestry over vegetable gardens. The coffee agroforestry system can generate complex vegetation canopy stratification with a multi-layered vegetation canopy, resembling natural forest stratification. Illegal hunting of bird species for trade is one of the causes of the decline in bird populations in rural ecosystems of West Java, including in Cijambu Village. The coffee agroforestry provides a habitat for rural birds.

TI  - The use of a mixed rubber landscape by tufted-ear marmosets
T2  - PRIMATES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the loss and fragmentation of tropical forests, the survival of primates depends on their ability to adapt to human-introduced modifications in their habitat. Marmosets are known for their ecological and behavioral plasticity and have been registered in various agricultural landscapes. Our goal was to describe the ecology of tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in a rubber/forest landscape, monitoring their use of habitat and diet. We followed two groups using radio telemetry and visual observations for nine months at the Michelin plantation Ltd. in Bahia, Brazil. Both groups used mainly pioneer forest and rubber with pioneer vegetation more than expected according to availability, even though they explored all types of vegetation. Rubber monocultures act as corridors for marmoset locomotion among more suitable habitats. Feeding, gummivory and socialization were mainly performed in the pioneer forest (with or without rubber), in which most sleeping sites and food sources were found. Groups of marmosets can incorporate agroforest matrixes to their area of use and activity patterns. Maintenance of marmosets in fragmented landscapes might be favored by their diet flexibility, with the use of resources such as gum and fruit, including exotic plants. Although known for their ecological flexibility, marmosets do require certain resources to be present in native habitat to adapt to agricultural landscapes. Patches of forest within a rubber landscape and pioneer vegetation in the rubber inter-rows should be considered to maintain populations of Callithrix in rubber landscapes.

TI  - The value of differently managed cacao plantations for forest bird conservation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the potential value of differently managed cacao plantations for bird conservation on Sulawesi, We Surveyed birds in near-primary forest (with limited timber and rattan extraction, and Some hunting), cacao plantations with remnant forest trees and plantations lacking forest trees, from February to April 2007. A total of 16 50 x 50 in plots were visited twice and records of 87 species were obtained. Bird species richness and the number of endemics and forest specialists decreased along this gradient of forest conversion, With 20% of the forest specialists, among them 10 endemics, exclusively found in forest. Species composition changed dramatically between habitat types. Sorensen indices showed a similarity of species composition between forests and plantarions of 45-60% for forest specialists and 65-71% for all species. The most important environmental variable for the diversity and composition of birds was the number of remnant rainforest trees present in the plantations. Our results Suggest that large, undisturbed rainforest arc, most important for the conservation of forest specialists and endemics but that cacao plantations, if managed to maintain a high and diverse cover of forest trees, call harbour up to 60% of forest specialists and endemics.

AB  - This study aims to analyse trade-offs among 6 (six) types of dominant land uses to consider Orangutan livelihood and landscape sustainability. The results of this study assists landscape's planners and policy makers for selecting development scenarios as well as policy within the landscape, especially to reduce human and wildlife conflict as impact of development. This study was conducted in Orangutan sub species Pongo pygmeus pygmeus habitat in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Net present value analysis was applied to identify economic profit of land uses and also perspective of expert judgment was applied to identify suitability of the land uses to Orangutan livelihood. The study shows that palm oil plantation was the dominant land use type in non-forest area category and natural forest is in forest area category within the site. Palm oil contributed highest economic profit (average IDR 11 Million per year) compared to other land use types, and thus the worst land use type for supporting Orangutan conservation; index suitability for Orangutan achieved only 21.8. The development of agroforestry which planted more than 3 valuable economic commodities is used as an alternative in forest buffer area development that can provide better gain for economic and Orangutan conservation with index suitability for Orangutan was 43.5. In achieving sustainability at the landscape level, it needs to consider the sustainability of the umbrella species, such as Orangutan. The existence of the umbrella species would also protect other biodiversity, forest and its environmental services.

TI  - CROP FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE INFLUENCES THE C:N RATIOS OF PRUNED BIOMASS AND LITTER IN SUCCESSIONAL AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
T2  - Oecologia Australis
M3  - Article
AB  - Functional identity (dominant values of plant traits) and functional diversity (variation in trait values) are part of the functional structure of a plant community and may direct species choice in intercropping to promote multiple agroecosystem services. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the functional structure of polycultures on the mass and C/N ratio of pruned crop biomass and litter layer in low-input Successional Agroforestry Systems on low-fertility sandy soil in Santa Catarina, humid subtropical Brazil. We established a long-term field experiment in 2016, in randomized complete blocks with six replications and three treatments that varied the functional structure of polycultures. We collected four traits of all intercropped plants: leaf N concentration (LNC), leaf pH, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). To characterize the functional identity, we calculated the trait mean, weighted by the relative biomass in each intercrop community (CWM). Functional diversity was calculated by Rao's quadratic entropy, also weighted by each crop's relative biomass. We performed principal components analysis and fitted the data using linear mixed models. Two principal components jointly explained 79% of data variation that measured the functional structure of communities. The first component (PC1) was strongly negatively related to the functional diversity indices, while the second (PC2) was strongly positively related to the functional identity indices (CWM of pH, LNC and SLA). As predicted by the mass-ratio hypothesis, intercrops dominated by species with large and thin leaves (high specific leaf areas), high leaf N concentrations and high leaf pH resulted in plant communities with low C:N ratio in leaves and stems of biomass available for pruning and produced litter layers with low C:N ratio. This study suggests that functional identity may be more important than functional diversity to manage biomass and litter quality in agroforestry systems on nutrient-poor soils.

TI  - Does certification improve biodiversity conservation in Brazilian coffee farms?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-environmental certification uses evaluation criteria to promote the conservation of the natural environment and landscape connectivity, with the aim of constructing agricultural landscapes more suitable for biodiversity conservation. To test this, we examine whether socio-environmental certification of Brazilian coffee farms contributes to local conservation, particularly in terms of deforestation control, habitat protection and regeneration, and connectivity. The analysis compared changes in landscape structure and connectivity in certified farms before (1995-2002) and after nine years from the beginning of the certification process (2002-2011), using as a reference the surrounding landscape and a control group of non-certified farms. To quantify changes in landscape connectivity we used probabilistic indices of functional connectivity based on graph theory, and two species of terrestrial mammals with contrasting dispersal capacities and habitat requirements: Priodontes maximus (giant armadillo) and Marmosops incanus (gray slender mouse opossum). Our results show that changes in the last decade have been subtle, but that certified farms differ from surrounding areas for the greater deforestation control and habitat availability for both land cover types, and for the greater connectivity for P. maximus. The difference between certified and non-certified farms is not clear-cut, however, we have evidence that the certified farms contributed more than the surrounding areas to the conservation of the studied species when the balance of gains and losses of connectivity is considered. The subtle differences in temporal changes and groups might be partially explained by the fact that certified farms already had a different conservation profile at the beginning of the certification process. Despite the limitations in the sampling size (small number) and time scale (only nine years after certification) which may hinders the detection of certification effects, our findings indicate that certification was important in controlling deforestation and the conversion of new natural areas to agricultural lands.

TI  - Tropical rainforest conversion and land use intensification reduce understorey plant phylogenetic diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Conversion of rainforest into agricultural land affects multiple facets of tropical plant diversity. While the effects of tropical land use change and intensification on species diversity are comparatively well studied, the effects on phylogenetic diversity (PD) and structure of plant communities are largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear how the loss of native species and addition of alien species collectively affect PD and structure.2. We investigated the PD and structure of understorey plants; a diverse and ecologically important, yet poorly studied group. We studied four prominent land use systems (tropical lowland rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations) in the lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia), a region experiencing dramatic land use changes.3. Across the four systems, we investigated differences in four metrics of phylogenetic community structure (PD, mean pairwise distance, mean nearest taxon distance, and their abundance-weighted variants). Our analyses were based on a comprehensive vegetation survey consisting of 32 plots, 1,197 species of vascular plants, and 146,599 plant individuals.4. Our results showed that forest conversion into agricultural systems leads to a pronounced loss of PD. Furthermore, the standardized effect size of mean pairwise distance indicated a gradual change from clustered to overdispersed phylogenetic community structure with increasing land use intensity from forest over jungle rubber to the monoculture plantations. In most land use systems, the presence or absence of alien plant species did not affect phylogenetic structure. Only in oil palm plantations, removing alien species from the data led to a more overdispersed structure. In conclusion, conserving the PD and structure requires efficient protection of the last remaining rainforests.

TI  - Effect of sewage sludge and sugarcane bagasse biochar on soil properties and sugar beet production
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, biochar has shown to be an alternative to waste disposal and a source of nutrients, acting as a soil amendment. The effects of two types of biochar on soil properties and sugar beet production as well as potential for carbon (C) sequestration were evaluated: biochar produced from sewage sludge (SB) and biochar produced from a 1:1 mixture of sewage sludge and sugarcane bagasse (MB). A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted using a sandy loam soil from the Brazilian savanna under treatments of MB applications at 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0%, SB application at 5.0%, and a conventional fertilization (CF) using lime and mineral fertilizers, with no fertilization as a control. After incubation for 45 d, seedlings were transplanted into each pot and cultivated for 55 d. Biochar characterization showed that pyrolysis reduced the biomass volume drastically, but concentrated the trace elements per unit of biochar weight. The MB treatments increased soil total C (by 27.8%) and pH (by 0.6), reduced the concentrations of nutrients, except for potassium (K), and chromium (Cr), and did not significantly alter lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations. Results of stable isotopes showed that all biochar treatments increased the total soil C stock and stability, suggesting a potential for application in C sequestration, and improved overall soil fertility. However, the biochar treatments also increased the concentrations of trace elements in the soil and plants. The sugar beet yields at 10.0% MB and 5.0% SB corresponded to 55% and 29% of the yield obtained in the CF treatment, respectively. These results may be due to biochar nutrients not being bioavailable when required by plants or to biochar nutrient adsorption.

TI  - Edaphic fauna and its relations with chemical, physical and microbiological attributes in Araucaria forest
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The permanent plant cover of the soil, in Araucaria forests, contributes to the conservation of the soil biodiversity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the soil fauna in discriminating native and reforested Araucaria forests. Native (NF) and reforested (RF) Araucaria angustifolia forests were evaluated in three regions of the state of Sao Paulo, representing three true replicates. In each area, fifteen soil samples were collected for the evaluation of the physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes and at the same points, the fauna was collected, using pitfall traps. The soil fauna was influenced by seasonality, presenting greater abundance of individuals in the summer. Collembola, Formicidae and Coleoptera groups were the most abundant ones, independently of the sampling season and the forest type. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) clearly differentiated native or reforested Araucaria areas. In PCA, Hemiptera, Collembola and Diplopoda were associated with RF in the winter, mainly due to the higher litter dry mass values. In NF, Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, Araneae and Coleoptera groups were explained by the higher quality of soil and litter, which was associated with NF. In summer, the groups Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Araneae, Coleoptera and Collembola, associated with NF, were explained by the higher values of microbial biomass carbon, Ca, P, organic carbon, macroporosity and dehydrogenase activity. In the CDA, the abundance of taxonomic groups was the most important attribute of the soil fauna for the discrimination of the forests. Likewise, soil moisture, soil P content, total porosity, and sulfur content of the surface litter contributed to discrimination between forests. There was some similarity between areas regarding certain groups of soil fauna, which we suggest being a result of the stability reached by the reforested areas, rendering them somewhat similar to the native ones.

TI  - Nearby rainforest promotes coffee pollination by increasing spatio-temporal stability in bee species richness
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural tropical forests are highly diverse and are known to contribute to forest-based services such as pollination of nearby crops. Landscape changes cause spatial and temporal bee community changes, but consequences how the community changes affect pollination is not well analyzed. This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination.The Study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and coffee pollination.Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and 60% per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500 m isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit set per agro-forest.In conclusion, crops grown near intact rainforests and which profit from the pollination by many species may fluctuate less in bee-pollinated fruit set across crop plants than crop plants in isolated agriculture that receive low or even single species pollination services (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Identifying appropriate reference ecosystems based on soil indicators to evaluate post-mining reclamation: A multivariate framework
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale mining operations, such as those associated with iron extraction, disturb soils and vegetation and create the need for effective rehabilitation practices. The Iron Quadrangle region of southeastern Brazil is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots; however, iron mining activities threaten many natural and seminatural ecosystem types in which many rare/protected species occur. The Iron Quadrangle has four main ecosystem types: Atlantic Forest (AF), ferruginous rupestrian grassland with dense vegetation (FRG-D); ferruginous rupestrian grassland with sparse vegetation (FRG-S); and quartzite rupestrian grassland (QRG). To support rehabilitation and monitoring plans, we evaluated reference areas and identified soil and vegetative attributes that best differentiated between these four ecosystems. We measured thirty-four physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and two vegetation parameters and, using a multivariate analysis, detected: 1) correlations between properties and 2) differences between areas. We identified twelve properties that best differentiated the areas (in order from most to least relevant): nickel content; exchangeable aluminum; clay content; above-ground vegetation volume; aluminum saturation; particle density; bulk density; arsenic content; zinc content; lead content, fine sand plus silt content; and fine sand content. Soil physicochemical properties proved to be more sensitive to differences in ecosystem type, and in particular, parameters related to fertility and the presence of metals and semi-metals differentiated the AF from the FRG-D and FRG-S. Soil physical properties, including fine sand and silt content, were most important for differentiating QRG from the other ecosystems, possibly resulting from the exposure of quartzite material to erosive processes. This study demonstrates the importance of identifying appropriate reference areas for post-mining reclamation.

TI  - Biological properties of disturbed and undisturbed Cerrado sensu stricto from Northeast Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to measure soil microbial biomass and soil surface fauna in undisturbed and disturbed Cerrado sensu stricto (Css) from Sete Cidades National Park, Northeast Brazil. The following sites were sampled under Cerrado sensu stricto (Css) at the park: undisturbed and disturbed Css (slash-and-burn agricultural practices). Total organic and microbial biomass C were higher in undisturbed than in disturbed sites in both seasons. However, microbial biomass C was higher in the wet than in the dry season. Soil respiration did not vary among sites but was higher in the wet than in the dry season. The densities of Araneae, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera were higher in the undisturbed site, whereas the densities of Formicidae were higher in the disturbed site. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis separated undisturbed from disturbed sites according to soil biological properties. Disturbance by agricultural practices, such as slash-and-burn, probably resulted in the deterioration of the biological properties of soil under native Cerrado sensu stricto in the Sete Cidades National Park.

TI  - Short-term biochar effects on greenhouse gas emissions and phosphorus availability for maize
T2  - AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to environmental issues, many methods of exploiting renewable natural resources are alternatives to reduce the dependence on non-renewable agricultural inputs. Phosphate fertilization on weathered tropical soil and waste reuse, for example, requires better management strategies. Thus, biochar from organic residues can be a strategy to reduce pressure on natural resources, in addition to having the potential to mitigate climate change. This study aimed to evaluate the availability of P in tropical soils from the interaction of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the aboveground and root systems of the plant and its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results indicated that the addition of biochar was an alternative for C sequestration and GHG mitigation, causing no damage to the plant. The applied biochar amount had, for the most part, emission equal to or less than the control treatment (soil only). The sugarcane straw biochar (BCS) showed higher emissions, mainly in the presence of P and AMF. Biologically speaking, there was no significant effect in the presence of mycorrhizae. However, with regard to plant production, treatments where mycorrhizae were inoculated, longer and wider leaves were found. In the production of maize (Zea mays L.) plant material (aboveground and root), the upper and lower values were related to the poultry manure biochar (BPM) , and the presence of P, the values were lower, indicating that, for the good development of the plant, only the presence of the biochar is sufficient, without requiring the addition of phosphate fertilizer.

TI  - Richness and composition of the communities of ants and termites in the Floresta Nacional de Sao Francisco de Paula (Flona-SFP), RS.
T2  - Acta Biologica Leopoldensia
M3  - Article
AB  - The Floresta Nacional de Sao Francisco de Paula (FLONA-SFP), one of the last remnants of the mixed ombrophilous forest in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, has long suffered because of intensive logging. The original forest has changed into a mosaic of native vegetation patches with and without Araucaria angustifolia and patches of commercial forest, surrounded by large areas of native field. The biodiversity of the FLONA-SFP was evaluated on the basis of the richness and composition of species of the ant and the termite communities in four patches with different vegetation structures and in one open field area. A total of 37 ant species belonging to seven subfamilies was collected. The patch without A. angustifolia was the richest one (S-obs=23), followed by the one with A. angustifolia (S-obs=19), the Pinus forestation (S-obs=16) and the area reforested with Araucaria (S-obs=14), with seven ant species common to all four forest patches. In the open field only three ant species were recorded. In the same areas, eight termite species belonging to two subfamilies were collected. The native patch without A. angustifolia and the area reforested with 0A. angustifolia were the richest areas (S-obs=4), followed by the Pinus forestation (S-obs=3) and the native patch with A. angustifolia (S-obs=2). A single species of termite was common to all four forest patches. Two species of termites occurred only in the open field. New records for the State of Rio Grande do Sul include two species of Formicidae, Eciton burchelli (Ecitoninae) and Oxyepoecus crassinodus (Myrmicinae), and one species of Termifidae of the genus Dihoplotermes (Termitinae).

TI  - Human behaviors determine the direct and indirect impacts of free-ranging dogs on wildlife
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dogs (Canis familiaris) are among the most abundant and widely distributed carnivores worldwide, and their presence can have negative impacts on native fauna. This study investigated the invasion of cacao agroforests by free-ranging dogs in Brazil. By monitoring the behavior of dogs using direct observations, we assessed whether direct (chasing and predation) and indirect (urine and fecal deposition) interactions with wildlife are more common when dogs enter the agroforests with humans than when they stay outside. We also compared the time that dogs spent inside versus outside the agroforests, and estimated their areas of use. The dogs (n = 10) spent a small fraction of the time without their owners, and only when moving inside the cacao agroforests. The dogs fed and rested more in open habitats and house surroundings than in agroforests, but they were more active and depredated wildlife exclusively in the latter. Kernel estimates of space use at the 50% and 95% levels ranged from 1 to 46 ha and 6 to 202 ha, respectively. Most of the area used by dogs was within cacao agroforest, while core areas were concentrated near human residences and in places of owner permanence in cacao agroforest. Human movement was a key determining factor in the use of space by the dogs. Changes to human behaviors toward their dogs must be considered if the direct and indirect impacts of dogs on wildlife are to be mitigated.

TI  - Local farmers' attitudes towards artificial wildlife bridges in a fragmented agroforestry environment
T2  - FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmentation of tropical forests has severe consequences for global biodiversity. The island of Java, Indonesia has a long history of deforestation and outside the protected area system, the island contains a patchwork of small forest fragments among expanding agricultural land, human settlements, and infrastructure. The arboreal Javan slow loris' (Nycticebus javanicus) remaining habitat largely occurs in these anthropogenic landscapes. Arboreal canopy bridges have proven to be a successful conservation intervention for Javan slow lorises but must be built on the private land of farmers. Here, we describe the process of collaborating with local farmers to construct and maintain canopy bridges over their farms to aid in connecting habitat for Javan slow lorises. We held non-structured conversations with ten farmers to understand their perceptions of the bridges. We found an overall positive attitude towards slow lorises, as well as acknowledgement of the economic importance of the bridges. Farmers also recommended improvements, including ensuring equity of the bridges in the community and increased financial commitment from the conservation project. There is growing appreciation amongst conservationists that trust and collaboration with local communities are essential for carrying out successful initiatives. We recommend regular discussions with community members in similar interventions to ensure the long-term trust and involvement of local people.

T2  - AGRIVITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Homegarden-dry field is one of land management form that maintains biodiversity while at the same time synergize the production and conservation. Changes in market conditions pose a threat for monoculturalism on homegarden and dry field. On the basis of this consideration, it is necessary to do a research on trees health in homegarden and dry field. This study aimed to determine the constituent species in the agroforestry system of Kulon Progo, tree health typology in Kulon Progo, and the type of damages to homegarden and dry field tree species in agroforestry. This research method used inventory of species in the agroforestry system and identification of damage to trees using Forest Health Monitoring (FHM). The result showed that there were three typologies of tree's health. Those were classified into typology 1, 2 and 3 in Kulon Progo. The types of damage that present at homegarden and dry field in Kulon Progo are the open wound, galls rust, broken branch, leaf spot, excessive branching, gummosis and termite attack.

TI  - Multiple traps of scientific knowledge transfer: Comparative case studies based on the RIU model from Vietnam, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, and Sweden
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transfer of scientific knowledge has received great attention by scientists and policymakers especially in fields that are crucially dependent on scientific knowledge like biodiversity conservation or climate change. Although many efforts have been made to better understand how scientific expertise can have an impact on politics, few studies have investigated the influence of limiting factors on scientific knowledge transfer. In this paper, we use a meta-analysis of 13 existing individual case studies from 5 different countries that all have in common that they apply the Research-Integration-Utilization model (the RIU model) to analyze limits of scientific knowledge transfer within research, integration, and utilization. Our results show that the factors of research, integration, and utilization are independent from each other in limiting or increasing the transfer of scientific knowledge. The independence of the RIU's factors also reveals that the increase of scientific knowledge alone will not lead to an improvement in knowledge transfer. There is empirical evidence in our cases providing that utilization could also be possible without a strong scientific basis, and successful integration could be based on weak scientific grounds. As a result of the independence of the different factors the RIU model consists of, the traps of scientific knowledge transfer could be observed in one or multiple RIU's factors and therefore improvements in scientific knowledge transfer should be orientated toward solely one or multiple factors instead of the whole process. We recommend that single improvements of different individual factors (research, integration, utilization) can help to improve the whole process of scientific knowledge transfer.

TI  - Effects of shade cocoa plantation on artificial fruit consumption by birds in two contrasting landscapes in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the influence of forests and agroforestry systems on fruit consumption by birds, we studied two landscapes, one covered predominantly with forests and the other dominated by traditional shade cocoa plantations. In each landscape, we sampled three forest fragments and three shade cocoa plantations. We placed 15 artificial fruits in 25, 1-2-m-tall shrubs spaced every 50 m and evaluated the detection and consumption of fruits after 72 h. We used hemispherical photographs positioned above each fruit station to evaluate canopy openness. We found a statistically significant difference in fruit consumption between landscapes, which means that more fruits were detected and consumed in the forest-dominated landscape. However, forests and shade cocoa plantations within each landscape exhibited similar fruit consumption. Canopy openness was similar between the landscapes, however, the cocoa plantations exhibited greater canopy openness than forests. The results of this study reinforce the importance of the presence of forests in the agricultural landscape. Thus, to evaluate the capacity of agroforest to protect species and maintain ecological interactions it is also necessary to consider the landscape context.

TI  - Slow death of Atlantic forest trees in cocoa agroforestry in southeastern Brazil
T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa ( Theobroma cacao) is cultivated in the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo in eastern Brazil under the so-called 'cabruca system', where the understorey of native Atlantic forest is cleared and the canopy is thinned out to provide adequate shading for the cocoa trees. Apart from its economic and social role, the cabruca system is said to be important for the conservation of Atlantic forest biodiversity. In this paper we studied tree species richness and forest structure of cabrucas to examine the demographic health of these forests and discuss their long-term survival. Data were collected in 20 farms located alongside a 30 km track of the northern margin of the Rio Doce, in northern Espirito Santo. All trees gtoreq5 cm DBH were identified and their diameter was measured in 80 plots (600 m2), totalling 4.8 ha of sampled area. Recorded trees were also allocated to four different regeneration phases ( pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and climax). The inventory resulted in 507 trees belonging to 105 species in 39 families. This species richness is much lower than in less disturbed forests located in the region. Pioneers and early secondary species dominate the cabruca forest in terms of number of species (56.2%), density (71.0%) and basal area (72.3%). The distribution of diameter frequency showed an imbalance in tree regeneration. Most trees in the range of 5-30 cm DBH were pioneers (40.7%), or early secondary species (32.6%), while late secondary and climax trees were less frequent (10.2 and 16.5% of the sampled trees, respectively). The dominance of species of early regeneration phases was also observed for trees >30 cm DBH (69.0% of pioneers or early secondary and 31.0% of late secondary or climax species). The results indicated that the cabruca forests are not only less diverse and less dense than secondary or primary forests of the region, but also, and more importantly, their natural succession and gap dynamics are being severely impaired. As a consequence, cabrucas present a structure where tree species of late successional phases are becoming increasingly rare while pioneers and early secondary species are becoming dominant. If current management practices of thinning and clearing of native trees are not improved, the long-term survival of these forests is questionable and their role in maintaining biodiversity in the long run is limited.

TI  - A socio-eco-efficiency analysis of integrated and non-integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems in the Brazilian Cerrado based on LCA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-livestock-forest (CLFi) and crop-livestock (CLi) systems are among the most recent agricultural developments in Brazil, and aligned with the principles of cleaner production. Such integrated systems can provide at least three types of product from the same land area over a defined period. This paper presents a holistic sustainability evaluation using life cycle assessment to compare combinations of integrated and conventional systems in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, intensification achieved through good practices such as association, rotation, and succession by an agroforestry system, optimization of inputs (including water, energy, fertilizers, and crop protection agents), land use, soil quality, biodiversity and social aspects.

TI  - Environmental filtering of agroforestry systems reduces the risk of biological invasion
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prevention is the most effective way of mitigating the negative impacts of exotic species invasions on biodiversity. Preventative measures include inhibiting the further dispersal and recruitment of established invasive species. We expect coffee production in agroforestry systems to reduce the recruitment of exotic species relative to monoculture stands because intercropped trees function as environmental filters that select for individuals with traits such as shade tolerance. If ecologically similar species are also closely related phylogenetically, such environmental filters should reduce phylogenetic diversity, supporting the coexistence of closely related species. Here, we test whether the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of native and exotic species in agroforestry systems is lower than in monocultures. We sampled the understory in 180 plots distributed in both habitats in three study sites within the Araponga municipality, Brazil, and measured understory light availability. Phylogenetic diversity was calculated as the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Understory light availability was lower in agroforestry systems. Of the 48 species found, 25 occurred in agroforestry systems, three of which were exotics. Forty-two species were found in monoculture stands (including 13 exotics). As expected, NRI and NTI indicated lower phylogenetic diversity in agroforestry systems than in monoculture stands. Agroforestry systems provide less favorable habitats for exotic species, filtering them from the understory. The mechanisms that select against exotic species remain unknown; however, shading might exclude predominantly heliophytic exotic species from the agricultural matrix. Therefore, agroforestry systems may function as buffer zones preventing invasion into sensitive ecosystems.

TI  - Positive forestry: The effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit feeding butterfly assemblages in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have increased in area in tropical regions in recent decades and many studies have sought to evaluate their impact on native biodiversity. Yet, few have assessed the impact of perennial plantations such as rubber-tree harvesting on native biodiversity. The goal of our study was to assess the effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit-feeding butterflies of the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Forest in Brazil. To do so, we sampled fruit-feeding butterfly species in a landscape mosaic composed of primary forest, rubber tree plantations under two management regimes (active production with intense management and undergrowth suppression and low management plantations with no undergrowth suppression), and forest fragments immersed in rubber tree plantation matrix. By trap-baiting butterflies for a year, we captured 5800 individuals of 85 butterfly species. Species richness was higher in unmanaged (no growth suppression) plantation and forest fragments (57-60 species) and lower in managed plantation (with growth suppression) (47) and primary forest (43). Ordination analysis suggests three main community groups formed by primary forest samples, a cluster combining unmanaged plantation and fragments, and managed plantation. There was substantial variation in butterfly abundance in the landscape, but our data suggest that several forest specialists species are able to occur along the mosaic on the landscape, and despite differences in management the entire landscape can contribute for a rich biota. Loss of understory vegetation led to simplified communities, with skewed dominance of a few species. By allowing understory development, a low impact management can provide adequate habitat for native butterflies. Yet, current rubber tree plantation technology does not normally use this method, opting to use the high management approach instead. We hypothesize that these minimally benign plantations may serve as conduits for butterflies in forest patches. Thus, we suggest that rubber tree plantations near Atlantic forest fragments should encourage understory development and establish a landscape mosaic, allowing forest fragments immersed in plantation matrix to be able to exchange individuals and colonize more complex plantation habitat. Intensive suppression of undergrowth should be avoided, except for trail maintenance, and isolation of fragments in this matrix should be kept to a minimum. If undergrowth suppression cannot be avoided, then establishment of stepping stones in plantation matrix should be encouraged to reduce isolation of fragments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Challenges for agroecological and organic management of Cabruca cocoa agroecosystems in three rural settlements in south Bahia, Brazil: perceptions from local actors
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th North American Agroforestry Conference
CL  - Virginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VA
AB  - Cabruca agroforestry systems play a crucial role as ecological corridors in biodiversity conservation on the south coast of Bahia. The decline in these agroecosystems due to land-use changes poses as a major threat to Atlantic Forest biodiversity conservation. Therefore, efficient agricultural extension actions towards the maintenance of these agroforestry systems are paramount. This research evaluated the process of construction and sharing of knowledge in agricultural extension practices toward agroecological management of the Cabruca in three agrarian reform settlements, and the challenges for the persistence of Cabruca in this region. We interviewed seven farmers and three extension agents from the Cabruca Institute. The study showed that most of the proposed practices adopted by farmers were already part of the traditional Cabruca management. The main limitations for the adoption of new practices were that they required increased labor, which is scarce and expensive. In fact, exodus and aging of the rural population remain major threats for long-term sustainability and persistence of Cabruca agroecosystems. Other limitations for organic management include the absence of differentiated price and marketing channels for organic cocoa and other products for the Cabruca social biodiversity. Although the process of construction and sharing of knowledge was participatory, overall community participation in the process was low. Extensionists should devise and implement innovative community engagement strategies to empower these small-scale farmer communities to ensure the persistence of Cabruca in the region and consolidate organic management of Cabruca agroecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether environmental changes promoted by the conversion from a Brachiaria decumbens monoculture to a silvopastoral system can be measured by the diversity, richness, abundance, and constancy of insects of the order Hymenoptera. A Malaise trap for collecting insects was installed in a B. decumbens area managed as a silvopastoral system, and another was installed in a monoculture system. Hymenoptera richness and abundance were determined based on the number of morphospecies and specimens, respectively. The diversity and constancy indices were calculated using the Shannon-Wiener and Bodenheimer methodologies. Fifteen families of Hymenoptera were collected, seven of which were unique to the monoculture system. The samples from the silvopastoral system were significantly more abundant (3,889) and rich (305) compared with those from the monoculture system, which were much less abundant (1,473) and rich (173). Similar trends were noted for the families Formicidae, Ichneumonidae, and Braconidae. Additionally, these families and Sphecidae showed significantly greater diversity in the silvopastoral system. Formicidae and Braconidae were constant in both systems, while Ichneumonidae was constant only in the silvopastoral system. The families Vespidae, Pompilidae, and Apidae were more diverse; Chalcididae, Pompilidae, Sphecidae, Halictidae, Evaniidae, and Gasteruptiidae were more abundant; and Vespidae had more richness in the monoculture system. The conversion from the monoculture system to the silvopastoral system can be measured by the occurrence of Hymenoptera, especially the families Formicidae, Ichneumonidae, and Braconidae, which can be used as potential bioindicators.

TI  - EFFICIENCY OF THE DENSE SOLUTIONS IN PHYSICAL FRACTIONATION OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms of stabilization of organic matter (OM) have been studied in Brazilian tropical and subtropical soils; however, few studies have evaluated the influence of the methodological part of the use of the solutions in the results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of two salt solutions (1.8 kg dm(-3) sodium iodide - NaI, and 2.0 kg dm(-3) sodium polytungstate - SPT) in separation of densimetric soil organic matter (SOM) fractions in two soils (Acrisol from southern Brazil - 220 g kg(-1) clay, and Ferralsol from the Cerrado [Brazilian tropical savanna] - 630 g kg(-1) clay) and the impact of this efficiency in interpreting results such as the magnitude and importance of the mechanism of physical protection by occlusion in aggregates in organic matter accumulation in Brazilian soils. Soil samples taken from the 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m layers underwent density fractionation, and the free light fraction (FLF), occluded light fraction (OLF), and heavy fraction (HF) of OM were obtained. The use of 2.0 kg dm(-3) SPT increased the content of organic carbon (C) in the FLF and in the OLF of both soils in comparison to 1.8 kg dm(-3) NaI, and the effect was more pronounced in the OLF. Use of the NT system increased the SOM content in the 0-0.05 m layer compared to CT in the Acrisol. The mechanism of physical protection of SOM by occlusion in aggregates was effective in increasing soil C stocks, accounting for. of C accumulation in the 0.00-0.05 m layer of the Acrisol. For the Ferralsol, there were no differences between the stock of total organic carbon (TOC) in NT and CT, but the soil in NT showed an accumulation of approximately. of the C stock as OLF in the topsoil. Physical protection by occlusion in aggregates is a significant mechanism in C stabilization and sequestration in tropical and subtropical soils, but its importance may be masked by the low efficiency of the NaI solution in studies of densimetric fractionation of SOM.

TI  - Use and knowledge of forest plants among the Ribeirinhos, a traditional Amazonian population
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the ethnobotanical use and knowledge of forest plant diversity among the Ribeirinhos, a traditional population of the Brazilian Amazon living in a protected area (Tapajs National Forest, West of Para), and compared the importance of forest plants used in their daily activities with the use of cultivated plants (agrobiodiversity) from their home gardens and swidden-fallows. We used two complementary quantitative ethnobotanical methods, based on (i) daily scan observations in 14 families' homes, and (ii) ethnobotanical inventories of trees, palms and lianas of DBH a parts per thousand yen 5 cm in 23 plots each of 0.1-ha, set up in three types of forests. Analyses of the ethnobotanical surveys in the plots showed that most forest species (120 out of the 140 inventoried, i.e. 86 %) were acknowledged to be useful by the informants (use value > 0) and accounted for 91.2 % of the inventoried individuals measuring DBH a parts per thousand yen 5 cm. However, daily observations of plant gathering in homes showed that only a few forest species considered 'useful' were used daily, whilst species cultivated in gardens and swidden-fallows represented the majority of species used. The Ribeirinhos were also found to know as much about using forest plant diversity, if not more, than other traditional groups from Amazonia or from other tropical regions of South America, including the Amerindians. The article concludes with some recommendations for adapting development practices to local uses of plant diversity in this protected area.

TI  - Conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations affects the functional composition of litter and soil Collembola
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

TI  - Landscape forest cover and regional context shape the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps.
T2  - Landscape Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextThe expansion of agricultural lands threatens biodiversity maintenance across the tropics. Although some agroforestry systems may be biodiversity-friendly, their conservation value likely depends on the landscape and regional contexts in which they are embedded-a poorly tested hypothesis.ObjectivesWe assessed the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps, and evaluated whether such value depends on the remaining forest cover at the landscape and/or regional scales.MethodsUsing a paired design, we compared [alpha]- (species number) and &be-diversity of each taxon between cocoa agroforests and neighbouring rainforests in 30 landscapes from three regions with different deforestation levels from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed whether the species number ratio (cocoa/forest) and &be-diversity related to landscape-scale forest cover, and whether such a relationship differed among regions (interacting effect).ResultsCocoa agroforests held more bee and wasp species than forests, and &be-diversity between habitats was moderate (bees) to high (wasps). Bees' species number ratio peaked at the intermediate-deforested region, and &be-diversity decreased with increasing forest cover, indicating that both land uses shared more species in more forested landscapes, especially in the high- and intermediate-deforested regions. Yet, for social wasps, &be-diversity varied only within regions, with habitats sharing more species in the low-deforested region.ConclusionsOur findings highlight that the conservation value of shaded cocoa agroforests for bees and social wasps depends on local and regional landscape forest cover. With cocoa agroforest being highly permeable matrix which increases with higher forest cover especially for bees in high- and intermediate-deforested regions.

TI  - Slow death of Atlantic forest trees in cocoa agroforestry in southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa ( Theobroma cacao) is cultivated in the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo in eastern Brazil under the so-called 'cabruca system', where the understorey of native Atlantic forest is cleared and the canopy is thinned out to provide adequate shading for the cocoa trees. Apart from its economic and social role, the cabruca system is said to be important for the conservation of Atlantic forest biodiversity. In this paper we studied tree species richness and forest structure of cabrucas to examine the demographic health of these forests and discuss their long-term survival. Data were collected in 20 farms located alongside a 30 km track of the northern margin of the Rio Doce, in northern Espirito Santo. All trees greater than or equal to5 cm DBH were identified and their diameter was measured in 80 plots (600 m(2)), totalling 4.8 ha of sampled area. Recorded trees were also allocated to four different regeneration phases ( pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and climax). The inventory resulted in 507 trees belonging to 105 species in 39 families. This species richness is much lower than in less disturbed forests located in the region. Pioneers and early secondary species dominate the cabruca forest in terms of number of species (56.2%), density (71.0%) and basal area (72.3%). The distribution of diameter frequency showed an imbalance in tree regeneration. Most trees in the range of 5-30 cm DBH were pioneers (40.7%), or early secondary species (32.6%), while late secondary and climax trees were less frequent (10.2 and 16.5% of the sampled trees, respectively). The dominance of species of early regeneration phases was also observed for trees >30 cm DBH (69.0% of pioneers or early secondary and 31.0% of late secondary or climax species). The results indicated that the cabruca forests are not only less diverse and less dense than secondary or primary forests of the region, but also, and more importantly, their natural succession and gap dynamics are being severely impaired. As a consequence, cabrucas present a structure where tree species of late successional phases are becoming increasingly rare while pioneers and early secondary species are becoming dominant. If current management practices of thinning and clearing of native trees are not improved, the long-term survival of these forests is questionable and their role in maintaining biodiversity in the long run is limited.

AB  - Coal mining leaving large overburden which needs to be rehabilitated by conducting reclamation and re-vegetation. This study objective was to evaluate plant species composition after thirteen years of re-vegetation activities in a coal mining rehabilitation site in KutaiTimur District, East Kalimantan, with coordinate 00 degrees 33'23 ''-00 degrees 38'17 '' NL and 117 degrees 23'55 ''-117 degrees 23'20 '' EL. This study compared rehabilitation site with the natural forest conditions sites. There were found 28 plant species in the rehabilitation site, consisting of 19 wood species (Cassia siamea and Ficus uncinata) and 9 non-wood species (Nephrolepis biserata and Miscanthus javanica). In comparison, 36 species were found in the natural forest condition, consisting of 25 woody species (Nephelium eriopetalum and Macaranga hypoleuca) and 11 non-wood species (Fordia splendidisima and Saurauia umbellata). Woody species diversity indices in the rehabilitation site after 13 years post mining (i.e., 2,21) was lower than in the natural forest sites (3,01); while the diversity indices for non-wood species were relatively similar (1,48 and 1,96 in the rehabilitation and natural forest sites respectively). Species richness of non-wood species was low, but it has a high coverage per species in this site. To restore rehabilitation site woody species to its assumed natural conditions, 22woody species should be planted.

TI  - Relationships between invertebrate communities, litter quality and soil attributes under different cacao agroforestry systems in the south of Bahia, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between soil and litter attributes to soil and litter fauna, and further to determine which of these attributes would be most significant in explaining the distribution of faunal communities in cacao agroforestry systems in the south of Bahia, Brazil. Soil and litter samples were collected in five cacao agroforestry systems: a cacao system renewed under Erythrina sp. (CRE); a cacao system renewed under natural forest (Cabruca-CRF); a cacao system under Erythrina sp. (CE); a cacao system under a natural forest system (Cabruca-CNF) and a cacao germplasm collection area (CGC). Soil and litter samples were also collected from natural forest (NF) near the agroforestry systems. The path analysis was used to evaluate the interdependencies among a set of variables including direct and indirect test effects that can be mediated by an intermediary variable. An average of 1367 (+/-126.5) individuals m(-2) and 10 (+/-0.3) taxa per sample were found under these areas. Soil attributes and litter quality under different cacao agroforestry systems affected the diversity of the soil and litter fauna, and these attributes are potential regulators of the fauna functional groups. The chemical components related to acidity, nutrition, and palatability are most decisive for abundant and diverse soil and litter fauna. Attributes which affected soil fauna in cacao agroforestry systems included mainly pH and bulk density in soil and polyphenols and lignin content in the litter. The faunal communities were more sensitive to litter quality than soil quality. Litter management could be a good practice to maintain healthy activities of the faunal community and to maintain improved ecosystem functioning in cacao agroforestry systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sengon plantation is the primary commodity of the community forests, which produces timber with high economic value, especially in Java Island. However, now the condition of sengon stands in Java Island, pests and diseases have attacked most. The information about the health and the severity of the stands due to pests and diseases is beneficial for determining stand productivity and investment security. The purpose of this activity is to determine the level of damage on sengon stands at various locations in Serang Regency, Banten, based on indicators of tree vitality. The method used to determine stand health is Forest Health Monitoring (FHM), which includes using tree vitality indicators and site quality indicators as a basis for assessment. The observation plot was carried out at 3 locations determined purposively based on the flat distance from the beach, which is < 2 km; 2> X< 4 km; 4> X <= 6 km. The results showed that the average percentage of healthy sengon trees was still quite high (82.7%), but the level of damage to stands was moderate. The most common type of damage is gummosis (distance <= 2 km and > 4-6 km) and boktor (> 2- 4 km). Many tree damage occurs in the main branch location found in the live canopy section (code 6), especially in plots that are 2> X <= 4 km from the coastline and lower stem (distance <= 2 km). However, no damage was found at the root location (code 1), shoots (code 8) and leaves (code 9). The damage of the stem causes a decrease in wood production because the damaged at part of the stem cannot be used anymore. Visual Crown Ratio of sengon trees tends to be low due to young trees so that the canopy is not maximal Maintenance activities, as well as mixed planting techniques with intercropping plants and other woody plants, can prevent sengon plants from attacking pests and diseases.

TI  - Tillage effects on soil organic matter in density fractions of a Cerrado Oxisol
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclamation of Brazilian cerrados (savannas) has been intensified in the last decades, with implications for soil quality and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. Studying the impact of different tillage systems is essential to define better strategies for land use in Cerrado, which may favor C sequestration and improve soil quality. We used density fractionation and C-13 natural abundance to assess changes in SOM in an Oxisol previously under a cerrado sensu-stricto following 30 years of cultivation. The objectives of the study were to: (i) evaluate the long-term impact of tillage systems on SOM stocks in a Dark Red Latosol (Oxisol) from the Cerrado Biome, and (ii) better understand the dynamics of SOM in different density fractions of this soil. Cultivation led to compaction, which significantly increased soil bulk density. This resulted in the systematic overestimation of C and N stocks in cultivated areas when compared to the natural cerrado. Conversion of the cerrado into cropland using plow tillage (PT) or no-tillage (NT) system did not alter the total C (similar to100 Mg ha(-1)) and N (similar to7 Mg ha(-1)) stocks in the first 45 cm depth at the end of 30 years of cultivation. However, about 22% of the total C was replaced by C from maize. The relative replacement of C decreased following the order: free light fraction (F-LF) > heavy fraction (HF) > occluded light fraction (O-LF). The low substitution in the O-LF was attributed to a possible presence of charcoal. Converting cerrado into cropland significantly decreased F-LF quantity. The proportions of C replacement in this fraction were higher in PT than NT, suggesting a faster turnover in PT. Nevertheless, because most C (similar to95%) was held in the HF, C dynamics in the whole soil were controlled by the behavior of this fraction. The maintenance of C levels even at the end of 30 years of cultivation and the lack of differentiation between NT and PT were attributed to the high clay contents and Fe + Al oxi-hydroxides concentrations of the studied soil as well as to a sufficient C supply by the maize crop.

TI  - Effects of shade tree cover and diversity on root system structure and dynamics in cacao agroforests: The role of root competition and space partitioning
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase yield, cacao is planted increasingly in unshaded monocultures, replacing a more traditional cultivation under shade. We investigated how shade tree cover and species diversity affect the root system and its dynamics.In a replicated study in Sulawesi (Indonesia), we studied the fine and coarse root system down to 3 m soil depth in three modern and more traditional cacao cultivation systems: unshaded cacao monoculture (Cacao-mono), cacao under either the legume Gliricidia sepium (Cacao-Gliricidia), or a diverse (> 6 species) shade tree cover (Cacao-multi). We analysed the vertical distribution of fine, large and coarse roots as well as fine root production, turnover and morphology on the species level.Stand-level fine root biomass showed a doubling with increasing shade tree cover (from 206 to 432 g m(-2)), but a tendency for a decrease in cacao fine root biomass. The presence of Gliricidia roots seemed to shift the cacao fine roots to a more shallow distribution, while the presence of shade tree roots in the Cacao-multi systems caused a biomass reduction and relative downward shift of the cacao roots. The turnover of cacao fine roots was much higher in the Cacao-multi stands than in the other two cultivation systems, although stand-level root production remained unchanged across the three systems. According to the stable isotope signature, Gliricidia extracted water from deeper soil layers than cacao, while no soil water partitioning was observed in the Cacao-multi stands.Our data suggest that the cacao trees altered their fine root distribution patterns in response to root competition. Both interspecific competition and root system segregation seem to play an important role in cacao agroforests with different shade tree cover.

TI  - BIOMASS QUANTIFICATION AND EMISSION REDUCTION CERTIFICATES FOR RUBBER - COCOA INTERCROPPING
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work were to quantify plant biomass and analyze the potential for generating Emission Reduction Certificates (ERCs) of 34-year-old rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis M. Arg) intercropped with 6-year-old cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). The experiment was conducted on the farms Fazendas Reunidas Vale do Juliana, Igrapiuna, BA. Tree biomass quantification was carried out using the direct destructive method by harvesting five rubber trees and ten cocoa trees, in an area of 2.2 ha. Litter biomass was quantified by collecting material from the ground. Total carbon storage in rubber-cacao intercropping was 91.5 Mg C ha(-1). Of this, 84.7 Mg C ha(-1) were stored in rubber trees, 5.22 Mg C ha(-1) in cacao trees and 1.67 Mg C ha(-1) in the litter. The amount of carbon found in the intercropping corresponds to 336 Mg CO2eq. ha(-1), equivalent to 336 CERs ha(-1). The rubber-cacao intercropping has carbon stock capacity, and can greatly contribute to the reduction of the greenhouse effect gases, being a promising activity to generate programs to obtain carbon credits.

TI  - Eucalyptus Carbon Stock Research in an Integrated Livestock-Forestry System in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus plantations play an important role in capturing and storing atmospheric carbon, mitigating global climate change. Forest management policies encouraging integrated livestock-forestry systems require quantitative estimates of temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage for these agricultural systems. This study quantified the effects of eucalyptus management and arrangement on carbon stock dynamics in integrated livestock-forestry (ILF) systems versus monoculture eucalyptus plantings. Arrangement and management resulted in equal storage of carbon in both monoculture and ILF systems (34.7 kg per tree). Both factors are important to better understand how forest species in integrated systems stock carbon and how this can compensate for other agricultural system components, such as cattle. The extent to which ILF systems offset beef cattle (Nellore) emissions was determined by estimating changes in carbon stock over time for Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis, clone H13, under three scenarios (S) of wood use. These scenarios were (S1) tree growth without thinning, (S2) trees used for biomass energy without thinning, and (S3) 50% of trees used for biomass energy at five years old and 50% of trees used for both timber and energy after eight years, considering the full life cycle of eucalyptus. The S1 and S3 systems can stock 510 and 73 metric tons (t) of CO2 ha(-1), respectively, while S2 emits 115 t CO2 ha(-1) of biogenic carbon.

TI  - Use of local ecological knowledge as phenology indicator in native food species in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological studies that aggregate local ecological knowledge on the expression of phenophases may be useful in the elaboration of management strategies of species that are important to a given local system. In this study, we seek to answer the following questions: 1) How do the different phenophases of two important native food species are expressed in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah) where they are collected? 2) How does rainfall influence the expression of the phenophases of these species on the evaluated phytophysiognomies? 3) Does the local ecological knowledge of the residents of the Araripe National Forest (hereafter FLONA) on the phenophases of native species of high importance correspond to what occurs in the three phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado? The phenological monitoring was executed monthly from January 2012 to December 2013. In order to retrieve the local knowledge about phenophases, key informants from three communities located around the FLONA were selected. Rainfall is a limiting factor for the expression of the reproductive phenophases of Caryocar coriaceum, differently from what occurs for the vegetative phases and for Hancornia speciosa. There were no significant differences between the local knowledge of communities that collect resources in the forest and most of the data collected in the phenological evaluation. In addition, there was no difference in the expression of the phenophases among the three phytophysiognomies, also corroborating with the local ecological knowledge. As for the community that collects in agroforestry yards, there were significant differences between knowledge and expression of phenophases. Thus, the use of local ecological knowledge of people who collect resources in the forest has proved to be reliable and may be promising mainly in rapid diagnoses of biodiversity.

TI  - What Makes Agroforestry a Potential Restoration Measure in a Degraded Conservation Forest?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is a win-win solution in terms of restoring forest function while benefiting the local community. This research aimed to (1) understand the regulations concerning conservation forest management and the restoration strategies adopted based on the history of forest degradation in the area, (2) investigate the factors driving local people to adopt agroforestry systems in the area, and (3) investigate the characteristics of the agroforestry system developed and its impacts based on farmers' perceptions. This research was performed in Wan Abdul Rachman Grand Forest Park, Lampung Province, Indonesia, and involved 59 respondents who managed 63 agroforestry plots in the area. Several schemes had been implemented to restore the degraded forest without involving the community, and the results were unsatisfactory. Changing the regulations concerning managing conservation forests to involve the community and providing legal permits and support from the management improved forest function due to community willingness to implement the agroforestry system. About 81% of observed plots consisted of 5-12 plant species, and 16% of plots consisted of 13-16 species per plot. Theobroma cacao was the most common species in the agroforestry plots, followed by Durio zibethinus, Parkia speciosa, and Aleurites moluccana. The size of the agroforestry plot affected the number of species in the plot. The community perception demonstrated that agroforestry has positive impacts on livelihood, the environment, and biodiversity at the landscape level.

TI  - Exploring vegetation's role in enhancing ant-based coffee berry borer control in an agroforestry system.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - The coffee industry faces a serious threat from coffee berry borer pests, causing significant economic losses. This research aims to explore the potential of using ants as a biological control method in coffee plantations, as well as the influence of shade on ant communities. The research was conducted in the Sumberjambe and Silo Sub-districts using purposive sampling methods to collect ant specimens with the beating sheet method. Specimens were identified in the laboratory, and data were analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the Evenness index, and the Margalef species richness index. The results showed 17 ant genera in Sumberjambe and 13 in Silo, with 7 of them acting as predators. The analysis indicated low diversity (H' =0.88-1.56) with the dominance of the Dolichoderus and Lasius genera at both locations. A high evenness index in Sumberjambe (E=0.75) indicated a uniform distribution, whereas a moderate value in Silo indicated a less uniform ant distribution (E=0.45). Species richness at both locations was considered low (Dmg=0.66-0.91). Comparative tests between the two locations did not show a significant difference in the diversity of ants that could potentially act as predators. This study also includes an analysis of tree species vegetation at the agroforestry sites, with Albizia chinensis trees showing the highest importance value in Silo (INP=209.37). This indicates the significant role of this plant in the ant agroforestry community. The Tapinoma genus (Pearson corr.=0.996, p-value=0.0467) and Solenopsis genus (Pearson corr.=0.993, p-value=0.0432) showed a very strong positive correlation with Albizia plants. However, some other combinations showed weaker correlations or approached zero, indicating that the number of vegetation species did not greatly influence their presence or abundance. This research provides insight into the diversity of ants, their potential role as predators of the coffee berry borer, and the relationship between ants and vegetation on two coffee-based agroforestry fields in Jember District, Indonesia.

TI  - Morphological diversity of springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) as soil quality bioindicators in land use systems
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the soil quality of native forest, eucalyptus plantations, pasture, integrated crop-livestock, and no-tillage systems, correlating the morphological diversity of springtails with physical and chemical soil properties. Springtail samples were captured from soils of the southern plateau of the State of Santa Catarina in Brazil, during winter and summer, by using Pitfall traps, using a 3 x 3 point grid. The morphotyping of springtails consisted of the observation of five traits and for each one a partial value of the eco-morphological index was assigned to obtain the modified Soil Quality Index. A correlation of the morphotype abundance and diversity with physical (soil moisture, bulk density, biopores, microporosity, and macroporosity) and chemical (pH in water, calcium/magnesium ratio and total organic carbon content) soil properties was studied, describing all results by variance and multivariate analyses. The springtail abundance and diversity were influenced by the different land use systems. Higher soil quality index was determined in native forest followed by eucalyptus plantations, pasture, no-tillage system and integrated crop-livestock, in the winter. Moreover, higher soil quality index was found in native forest followed by integrated crop-livestock, eucalyptus plantations, no-tillage system and pasture, in the summer. Therefore, the quality index of a soil can be evaluated by the springtail morphological traits in correlation with the physical and chemical properties such as calcium/magnesium ratio, total organic carbon contents, biopores, macroporosity, microporosity, soil moisture, bulky density and pH.

TI  - SOIL NITROGEN AND CARBON STOCKS, AND SOIL BULK DENSITY IN ORGANIC FERTILIZATION SYSTEMS OF CONILON COFFEE
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Production of Conilon coffee under organic management systems has increased in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. However, information is lacking in regard to the impact of these management practices on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic fertilization on C and N stocks and soil bulk density (Bd) in a Conilon coffee agrosystem. A field experiment was carried out in Linhares, ES, in a randomized block design in a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial arrangement, with three replications. The factors were: two organic composts; presence and absence of the jackbean legume between the rows; and five different proportions of each organic compost (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 %) to substitute the recommended mineral fertilization. Each replicate consisted of 30 coffee plants. Soil samples were collected under the canopy of each plant. The organic composts were compound 1, prepared from elephant grass and coffee straw in a 1: 1 ratio (v:v); and compound 2, prepared from elephant grass, coffee straw, and chicken litter in a 2: 1: 1 ratio (v: v: v). Soil samples were taken 240 days after fertilization (240DAF) in the 1st crop year and 30 days after the 1st stage of fertilization (30DAF) in the 2nd crop year. The use of organic compounds to fertilize coffee led to a decrease in Bd of approximately 13 %. The increase in the proportion of organic compounds in fertilization increased the content and stock of C and N in the soil at 30 days after fertilization in the 2nd crop year. There were increases of 11 and 0.4 Mg ha(-1) for the stock of C and N, respectively, for coffee plants fertilized with 100 % of compound 1, in relation to mineral fertilization. Fertilization with organic compounds is an alternative for increasing C and N stocks in agrosystems of conilon coffee.

TI  - Invertebrate soil macrofauna under different ground cover plants in the no-till system in the Cerrado
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work was aimed at evaluating the invertebrate macrofauna community in the soil, by means of its abundance and richness of groups under different plant covers in the no-till system. Evaluations were performed at the experimental field of Embrapa Agropecuaria Oeste, in the municipal district of Dourados-MS, on a Typic Hapludox under conventional, no-till, and natural systems. Samplings were performed in December 2000, June 2001, January 2002, and June 2002. Five soil monoliths measuring 0.25 x 0.25 m width and 0.30 m depth were sampled along a transect. Turnip residues before a corn crop (turnip/corn) and soybean residues before wheat and turnip crops (soybean/wheat and soybean/turnip) provided positive effects on the density and diversity of the edaphic macrofauna community.

TI  - Mega-development trends in the Amazon: Implications for global change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes four global-change phenomena that are having major impacts on Amazonian forests. The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr(-1) in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr(-1) from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr(-1) from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia.The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large-scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mate Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin.The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 Fl Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges.Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.

TI  - Diet specialisation reduces the occupancy of cocoa agroforests by diurnal raptors
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation, especially due to agriculture expansion, pose the main threats to biodiversity conservation. While some species are able to survive and proliferate in human-modified habitats (winner species), others are highly dependent on well-preserved habitats, being more vulnerable to extinction (losers). Many raptors can be considered loser species due to their high trophic position, large home ranges, and low reproductive rates. Consequently, this group is frequently used to reflect the environmental quality of habitats and the biodiversity status of communities. Here we describe the diurnal raptor assemblages found in shaded-cocoa agroforests (cabrucas) of Southern Bahia, Brazil, and the determinants of raptor occupancy in this system. We systematically surveyed diurnal raptors in 16 cabruca sites using complementary sampling methods - active search, playback, and point-count - and modeled species occupancy using covariates related to vegetation structure, landscape, management intensity, and biological traits (body mass, trophic level, and diet specialisation). We found a high number of species (at least 18) as able to use cabrucas and a negative relationship between species occupancy and the degree of diet specialisation. Thus, our results suggest that cabrucas have a high potential to mitigate the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on diurnal raptors, but this system alone may not support complete assemblages of this group. It highlights the need for the maintenance of forest remnants in the landscapes to increase species diversity at a regional scale and to assure the conservation of this group in Southern Bahian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Effects of different cultivation systems in leaf traits and herbivory damage in Ilex paraguariensis (Aquifoliaceae)
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different environmental conditions are crucial to determine many attributes in plants by selective pressures. Plant traits and ecological interactions may present variation in outputs in these distinctive selection scenarios. In south Brazil, yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.) has been cultivated in monoculture and in consortium systems, differing significantly in lightning intensity and associated plant richness. In this study, three areas of both cultivation systems were monitored to verify the plant outputs in leaf area and herbivory damage. Our results showed that consortium system cultivation presents higher values of leaf area and higher damage by herbivory. Higher leaf area in consortium system corresponds to numerous studies and corroborates the phenotypic plasticity expected for Ilex paraguariensis. On the other hand, the higher leaf damage opposed the hypothesis that greater plant richness should promote the best herbivory control by natural enemies. Despite the higher foliar loss plants cultivated under consortium-system present adequate leaf area to farmers. Beside species richness, other plant community traits play important role in mitigation of herbivory.

TI  - Sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl and its effects on the bacterial communities in Amazonian soils amended with aged biochar
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfometuron-methyl is a broad-spectrum herbicide, used throughout Brazil; however, its environmental impacts in biochar (BC) amended soils is not fully understood. Biochar is known to enhance soil quality but can also have undesired effects such as altering the bioavailability and behavior of herbicides. Microbial communities can degrade herbicides such as sulfometuron-methyl in soils; however, they are known to be affected by BC. Therefore, it is important to understand the tripartite interaction between these factors. This research aimed to evaluate the sorption-desorption and biodegradation of sulfometuron-methyl in Amazonian soils amended with BC, and to assess the effects of the interactions between BC and sulfometuron-methyl on soil bacterial com-munities. Soil samples were collected from field plots amended with BC at three doses (0, 40 and 80 t ha(-1)) applied ten years ago. The herbicide sorption and desorption were evaluated using a batch equilibrium method. Mineralization and biodegradation studies were conducted in microcosms incubated with C-14-sulfometuronmethyl for 80 days. Systematic soil sampling, followed by DNA extraction, quantification (qPCR) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed. The presence of BC increased the sorption of the herbicide to the soil by 11% (BC40) and 16% (BC80) compared to unamended soil. The presence of BC also affected the degradation of C-14-sulfometuron-methyl, reducing the mineralization rate and increasing the degradation half-life times (DT50) from 36.67 days in unamended soil to 52.11 and 55.45 days in BC40 and BC80 soils, respectively. The herbicide application altered the bacterial communities, affecting abundance and richness, and changing the taxonomic diversity (i.e., some taxa were promoted and other inhibited). A tripartite interaction was found between BC, the herbicide and soil bacterial communities, suggesting that it is important to consider the environmental impact of soil applied herbicides in biochar amended soils.

TI  - The diversity of soil-dwelling arthropods is significantly influenced by land use systems with tree cover in semiarid conditions.
T2  - European Journal of Soil Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes in vegetation and climate exert significant influences on soil fauna in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Additionally, evidence indicates that interactions between different plant layers promote soil fauna diversity through the variety of resources available. The objective was to assess the edaphic fauna in traditional land use systems, agroforestry systems and natural vegetation, under the influence of rainfall seasonality and plant strata in the semiarid region of Brazil. For this purpose, six types of land use were selected: agroforestry; silvopastoral; slash and burn with intensive use without fallow; slash and burn with six years of fallow; slash and burn with nine years of fallow; and a system representing the natural vegetation of the Caatinga. Edaphic fauna was collected using pitfall traps in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 43,363 individuals of the edaphic fauna were collected and grouped into taxa, determining abundance, diversity and functional groups. The results revealed higher abundance and diversity of edaphic fauna in the rainy season across all land use systems, but significantly higher numbers in systems with tree strata. The greater the abundance, richness and diversity of trees, the higher the diversity of edaphic fauna (Shannon Index - H: 0.7 < -H < 1) for the seasonal effect. Agroforestry systems were intermediate in the diversity of edaphic fauna (-H < 0.8) compared to other systems. Systems with greater heterogeneity in tree and herbaceous strata were the ones that most increased the diversity and activity of functional groups of edaphic fauna (H < 0.8; 0.5 < r < 0.9). In semiarid conditions, more attention should be given to agricultural production systems with greater tree diversity and interaction between tree and herbaceous strata to conserve the biodiversity of edaphic fauna and improve the soil health.

TI  - Dragonflies (Odonata) in Cocoa Growing Areas in the Atlantic Forest: Taxonomic Diversity and Relationships with Environmental and Spatial Variables
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the south of Bahia state, a large part of the native Atlantic Forest areas has been modified for the cultivation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao). These crops are cultivated under the shade of the canopy of native trees, a system locally known as the "cabruca" agroforestry system. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of Odonata assemblages (adults and larvae) in cocoa farming areas and to identify the relationships of these species with local and spatial environmental variables of the monitored sites. Altogether, adult and larvae were sampled at 22 sites. Physical and physicochemical water variables were recorded for each site. A total of 1336 dragonflies were collected, of which 20 were Zygoptera species and 30 were adult Anisoptera representatives. The different life stages were related to environmental variables such as conductivity, watercourse channel width, and dissolved oxygen. The space predictors were also associated with the assemblages, mainly for adults. The present study identified that cabruca areas maintain a great diversity of dragonflies, including species that are considered to be forest specialists and more sensitive to landscape changes. The characteristics of this cropping system are considered to be favorable for the conservation of the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Edaphic fauna in homogeneous plantation, agroforestry and native bush systems at two cities in Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. The soil fauna composition was evaluated in three environments. The present work, was analyzed the relations of the distinct groups of organisms in two different crop systems (homogeneous crop system, agroforestry system), beyond an area of native vegetation at South Half of the Rio Grande do Sul, in the Morro Redondo and Pinheiro Machado cities. The material collection occurred in the Abril/2007 maio/2007 period. The collections had been made by the use of Tretzel and Tullgren extractors. Five points had been sampled equidistant 20m each other and following an only line or squares depending on the relief. They are presented the total of organisms in each environment, the more frequent group, index of similarity and diversity in each environment. Collembola predominance was observed in the agroforestry system and Araneae in the homogeneous plantation and native vegetation. The differences found in the taxonomic diversity and frequency of each taxa in study environments are presented.

TI  - RUBBER TREE INTERCROPPING WITH FOOD-CROPS, PERENNIAL, FRUIT AND TREE CROPS: SEVERAL EXAMPLES IN ASIA, AFRICA AND AMERICA
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Initially developed by the Estate sector at the beginning of the century, most rubber tree plantings are from the smallholder sector. The initial model of diffusion was based on a strict monoculture. However, intercropping with annual food crops during the immature period of rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, are relatively well developed, including in rubber projects. On the other hand, the associations with perennial or forestry crops are rarely listed and often with little recognition from development institutions as it was the case in Indonesia during the 1990's. Such systems do exist locally, sometimes on a relatively important area such as the "jungle rubber" system for example. These agroforestry practices ensure a better land and tabour valorization. Permanent associations with perennial crops during mature period constitute an economic factor of stabilization and diversification of income. The complex agroforestry systems have also ecological advantages guaranteeing maintenance of a part of forest biodiversity. The lack of interest officially recognized for these associations in spite of economic and environmental advantages can be charged to the fact that such systems do not correspond to the dominating Estate and development projects rubber tree model. Many farmers innovated and developed pragmatic systems with agroforestry practices enabling them to decrease risks and to diversify their productions. This article tends to give a progress report on existing associations of rubber tree with food crops, coffee, tea, cocoa, rattan, fruit and timber trees or other forest species. It does not claim to analyze all systems in detail but provide an idea of the diversity of associations.

TI  - Viability of a macauba palm-Brachiaria grass intercropping system as an alternative to agroforestry production
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In intercropping systems, shading is one of the main limiting factors for the development of plants in the understory, especially C-4 plants. However, successful pasture production in silvopastoral systems can be achieved through proper spatial arrangement. This study provides fundamental information that validates the macauba-grass consortium. For 20 months, during two dry seasons and two rainy seasons, microclimatic and physical variables in an Acrocomia aculeata-Brachiaria decumbens intercropping system were monitored. The spacings of the trees were 5 m x 4 m, 6 m x 4 m, 7 m x 4 m, and 8 m x 4 m and were compared to a traditional pasture. The aboveground biomass in the intercropping system was estimated as well as its ability to assimilate atmospheric CO2 and store carbon. Macauba palm presence in the intercropping system had a regulatory effect on the microclimatic conditions of the understory, regardless of tree spacing and season. In spacing, wider, the intercropped forage biomass was satisfactory and similar to that in the monocrop pastures. The spacing 7 m x 4 m and 8 m x 4 m improved the understory microclimatic conditions, allowing efficient forage growth and thus offering livestock food and comfort. These values were equivalent to those of traditional silvopastoral systems that use woody plant species. The estimates of aboveground biomass, carbon stock, and CO2 assimilation in the intercropping system with a spacing of 8 m x 4 m were 1.6 times greater than those of traditional pastures. Therefore, here, we show for the first time that A. aculeata-B. decumbens grass intercropping system is a viable alternative agroforestry practice for tropical regions, since sufficient amounts of fodder are provided alongside beneficial environmental services, such as the efficient sequestration and storage of atmospheric carbon.

T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - NativeIlex paraguariensis(yerba mate) is one of the most widespread crops in the Atlantic Forest region of southern South America and has an important economic and cultural value in Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Despite the known potential of shade-grown products (especially cocoa and coffee) to protect biodiversity, the benefits of shade-grown yerba mate for biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic Forest remain scarce, one of the most threatened ecoregions in the world, also considered a biodiversity hotspot. In order to understand these potential benefits, it is important to identify how species use shade-grown yerba mate plantations, as well as if it can be an strategy to improve or maintain biodiversity in complex socio-ecological landscapes. We analysed the potential benefits of forests with shade-grown yerba mate for birds, amphibian and reptiles in the Reserve for National Park 'San Rafael' and its buffer area (Itapua Department, Paraguay). We evaluated differences in species richness and composition between three environments: forest with shade-grown yerba mate, forest edge and monoculture crop plantations analysing beta diversity. A total of 112 bird species were recorded in all three environments. Regarding the herpetological community, we recorded 10 species (seven amphibians and three reptiles). Our results indicate that forests with yerba mate plantations not only maintains the bird species richness, but also its species composition differs significantly from edge and croplands, which might be an indicator of the contribution of shade-grown yerba mate plantations to conservation. The results of the research would help to value the impact of sustainable agroforestry activities for the conservation of Atlantic Forest biodiversity. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Community conserved areas: policy issues in historic and contemporary context
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous and community conserved areas (ICCAs) are natural and/or modified ecosystems containing biodiversity values, ecological services, and cultural values, voluntarily conserved by indigenous and other communities through local or customary laws. They are found in both terrestrial and marine areas; they range in size from <1 ha sacred groves to >30,000 km(2) indigenous territories in Brazil. ICCAs should be recognized for what they may contribute to national and global conservation systems, but there is little documentation of their potential or discussion of their policy implications. Here I examine the historic and contemporary context of ICCAs, provide examples, and raise policy issues related to: assessing the conservation benefits of ICCAs, integrating traditional knowledge into protected area management, finding the right mix of governance regimes, and dealing with challenges faced by them.

T2  - Acta Zoologica Mexicana Nueva Serie
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation of the Amazonian rainforest and conversion to agriculture with the use of fire creates a mosaic of occupied lands and secondary forests. Considering the fundamental role of soil macrofauna and the lack of information about its resilience to deforestation, this study characterized the earthworms, ants and other soil arthropod communities in secondary forests of 40 and 20 years of age and in cropping system and pastures prepared with slash-and-burn or chop-and-mulch in the Brazilian Eastern Amazonia. Soil macrofauna was sampled according to the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biological and Fertility) methodology. Four sub-indices and one "macrofauna soil health index" were calculated using five principal component analyses. The macrofauna index identified better soil health in chop-and-mulch crops, followed by the 40 yr-old forest and the chop-and-mulch pasture. These results confirmed the fundamental role of old secondary forests for soil biodiversity conservation and the potential of the chop-and-mulch technique to mitigate the effects of land use changes.

TI  - Crop, livestock, and forestry integration to reconcile soil health, food production, and climate change mitigation in the Brazilian Cerrado: A review
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems have been widely adopted in the Brazilian Cerrado. In this study, we gathered the publications regarding the effects of the ICL and ICLF systems on soil health, plant and animal production, and carbon (C) balance and then synthesized them in comparable terms, aiming to evaluate the sustainability of these systems in a broader and comprehensive approach. On the basis of the evidence from 65 peer-reviewed publications, it was observed that adopting integrated systems can improve soil health in the Brazilian Cerrado. With a few exceptions, positive effects on chemical, physical, and biological indicators of soil health were observed in most of the studies that comprised our data. Accordingly, the results showed that the ICL and ICLF systems can improve plant yield and animal production, but special attention regarding the grazing regime and tree management (e.g., spacing, pruning, and thinning) is required. Moreover, soil C accumulation fully offsets soil N2O emissions, underscoring the feasibility of using the ICL and ICLF systems for decreasing the C footprint of agricultural commodities in this region. The research assembled in this review has undoubtedly advanced our knowledge regarding integrated systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. However, there are still significant knowledge gaps that should be addressed, such as their effects on soil physics and biology. Despite these shortcomings, our literature review demonstrates that the ICL and ICLF systems are essential strategies to intensify agricultural production in the Brazilian Cerrado while ensuring sustainability.

TI  - Assessment of mite fauna in different coffee cropping systems in Brazil
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agro-ecological diversification may increase natural biodiversity and decrease environmental impacts caused by the intensification of management practices, especially with respect to pest control. This study aimed to evaluate mite populations from surveys in commercial coffee (Coffea arabica) orchards managed in different ways. Four different cropping systems were compared: a conventional system (CS), non-pesticide system (NPS), organic system (OS) and organic agroforestry system (OAS). Mite samples were taken from 24 coffee plantations (n = 6 for each management strategy). Six leaves per plant were collected from five sampling sites totalling 30 leaves from each plantation. Mites were removed from individual leaves, counted and identified to family level. Amongst the predatory mites, two families were detected; the Phytoseiidae was the most abundant family while the Stigmaeidae, generalist predatory mites, were only found in two management systems (NPS and AOS). Of the two families of phytophagous mites, the family Tenuipalpidae was the most abundant, but rarely found in AOS. The other phytophagous family, Tetranychidae, was less abundant in coffee crops than Tenuipalpidae, but the most abundant phytophagous family in CS. Understanding the relationship between mite populations and management practices can aid in choice of spraying strategies for different coffee management systems.

TI  - The diversity of soil-dwelling arthropods is significantly influenced by land use systems with tree cover in semiarid conditions
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes in vegetation and climate exert significant influences on soil fauna in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Additionally, evidence indicates that interactions between different plant layers promote soil fauna diversity through the variety of resources available. The objective was to assess the edaphic fauna in traditional land use systems, agroforestry systems and natural vegetation, under the influence of rainfall seasonality and plant strata in the semiarid region of Brazil. For this purpose, six types of land use were selected: agroforestry; silvopastoral; slash and burn with intensive use without fallow; slash and burn with six years of fallow; slash and burn with nine years of fallow; and a system representing the natural vegetation of the Caatinga. Edaphic fauna was collected using pitfall traps in the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 43,363 individuals of the edaphic fauna were collected and grouped into taxa, determining abundance, diversity and functional groups. The results revealed higher abundance and diversity of edaphic fauna in the rainy season across all land use systems, but significantly higher numbers in systems with tree strata. The greater the abundance, richness and diversity of trees, the higher the diversity of edaphic fauna (Shannon Index - H: 0.7 < H- < 1) for the seasonal effect. Agroforestry systems were intermediate in the diversity of edaphic fauna (H- < 0.8) compared to other systems. Systems with greater heterogeneity in tree and herbaceous strata were the ones that most increased the diversity and activity of functional groups of edaphic fauna (H < 0.8; 0.5 < r < 0.9). In semiarid conditions, more attention should be given to agricultural production systems with greater tree diversity and interaction between tree and herbaceous strata to conserve the biodiversity of edaphic fauna and improve the soil health.

TI  - Tree species richness and density affect parasitoid diversity in cacao agroforestry
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, cacao is mostly planted beneath shade trees. The diversity of shade trees varies from monospecific to highly diverse canopies, characteristic of pristine Atlantic Forest. This study evaluates the relationships between family richness of Hymenoptera-Parasitica and Chrysidoidea, and tree species richness and density, the species richness of herbaceous understorey, and the area and age of the cacao agroforestry system. We sampled 16 cacao agroforestry systems, with canopy diversity ranging from one to 22 tree species per hectare, in three seasons: summer (March), winter (August) and spring (November). Parasitoids were sampled using eight Malaise-Townes traps per site. Tree species richness and density were enumerated within 1 ha at each site, and herbaceous plant species richness was calculated in eight 1 m 2 plots, within the hectare. The number of parasitoid families increased with tree species richness and density in spring and summer, but decreased in winter. Neither species richness of herbaceous plants nor area and age of the system affected parasitoid family richness. We suggest that the increase of parasitoid diversity with tree species richness and density in warmer seasons reflects increasing heterogeneity and availabitity of resources. The decrease in parasitoid family number with tree density in winter may be due to local impoverishment of resources, leading to parasitoid emigration to neighbouring forest remnants. This result implies that a higher diversity of shade trees will help to maintain high parasitoid levels and, in consequence, higher levels of natural enemies of cacao pests, particularly in the warmer seasons. This prediction is borne out in the experience of cacao producers. The proper management of shade tree diversity will. play a vital role in maintaining the sustainability of cacao agroforestry production systems in the tropics and, concurrently, will. maintain high biodiversity values in these locations.

TI  - The cacao agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic forest as habitat for the endangered maned sloth Bradypus torquatus
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sloths are arboreal mammals strictly dependent upon forested habitats. The southern part of the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil harbors important forest remnants and the highest genetic diversity known for the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), an endangered species endemic to the Atlantic forest. Large extents of cacao agroforests (cabrucas) connected to forest patches mitigate the effects of fragmentation in this region. We radio-tracked three maned sloths during 40 months in a cabruca at the vicinity of Una Biological Reserve, southern Bahia, and estimated their home range using two commonly employed estimators (minimum convex polygon (MCP) and kernel). Overall cabrucas comprised a significant portion of the home range of the three study animals (MCP: 7-100%) and at least a third of the areas of more intensive use (kernel: 27-99%). The tagged sloths used cabrucas more than expected according to the availability of this habitat in their home range and in the surrounding landscape. In addition to the tagged individuals, maned sloths were observed five times in the study area, twice in cabrucas. Eleven tree species present in cabrucas,me used as food sources by maned sloths. Results indicate that biologically rich cacao agroforests immersed in a landscape still largely composed of native forests, as is the case here, can provide habitat for the maned sloth. This finding spells good news for the conservation of this species, as southern Bahia is one of the most important strongholds for the maned sloth. However, further actions are necessary to protect the species from local extinction, including active management of protected areas, forest fragments, cabrucas and pastures in an integrated, landscape-level manner.

TI  - Earthworms as soil quality indicators in Brazilian no-tillage systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that earthworm populations tend to increase under no-tillage (NT) practices, but abundances tend to be highly variable. In the present study, data from the literature together with those on earthworm populations sampled in six watersheds in SW Parana State, Brazil, were used to build a classification of the biological soil quality of NT systems based on earthworm density and species richness. Earthworms were collected in 34 farms with NT aging from 3 to 27 yr. in February 2010, using an adaptation of the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility) Program method (hand sorting of five 20 cm x 20 cm holes to 20 cm depth). Six forest sites were also sampled in order to compare abundances and species richness with the NT systems. Species richness in the 34 NT sites and in the 6 forests ranged from 1 to 6 species. Most earthworms encountered were exotics belonging to the genus Dichogaster (D. saliens, D. gracilis, D. bolaui and D. affinis) and native Ocnerodrilidae (mainly Belladrilus sp.), all of small individual size. In a few sites, individuals of the Glossoscolecidae (P. corethrurus, Glossoscolex sp., Fimoscolex sp.) and Megascolecidae (Amynthas gracilis) families were also encountered, in low densities. Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae) were found only in the forest fragments. In the NT farms, earthworm abundance ranged from 5 to 605 ind m(-2) and in the forest sites, from 10 to 285 ind m(-2). The ranking of the NT soil biological quality, based on earthworm abundance and species richness was: poor, with <25 individuals per m(-2) and 1 sp.; moderate, with >= 25-100 individuals per m(-2) and 2-3 sp.; good, with >100-200 individuals per m(-2) and 4-5 sp.; excellent, with >200 individuals per m(-2) and >6 sp. About 60% of the 34 farms fell into the poor to moderate categories based on this classification, so further improvements to the NT farm's management system are needed to enhance earthworm populations. Nevertheless, further validation of this ranking system is necessary to allow for its wider-spread use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rainforest conversion to smallholder cash crops leads to varying declines of beetles (Coleoptera) on Sumatra
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asian arthropod biodiversity is in rapid decline, but the variability of responses within taxa has received little attention. Using canopy fogging, we collected similar to 50,000 beetles (Coleoptera) in (1) lowland rainforest, (2) jungle rubber (rubber agroforest), and smallholder monoculture plantations of (3) rubber and (4) oil palm in Sumatra, across two landscapes and seasons. On average, beetle abundance was more than 50%, and biomass over 75%, lower in rubber and oil palm plantations than in rainforest and jungle rubber. This pattern was influenced by landscape and season. Abundance and biomass declines were similar in Chrysomelidae, Elateridae, and Staphylinidae, but differed in Curculionidae, which were most abundant in oil palm due to the introduced oil palm pollinator Elaeidobius kamerunicus. Across beetle families, species richness in monocultures was reduced by at least 70% compared to rainforest, with beetle richness in jungle rubber being similar to rainforest. Community composition in oil palm plantations differed markedly from the other land-use systems for Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae, but less for Elateridae and Staphylinidae. Turnover contributed more to overall beta diversity than nestedness for all families and land-use systems. Likely undersampling of the beetle community in rainforest suggests that declines of beetle density and diversity are much more severe than reported here, especially for beetle families with many concealed species, such as Staphylinidae. This study provides first evidence that negative responses of beetles to tropical land-use change vary among families, and is the first report of its kind from heavily understudied Sumatra. Abstract in Indonesia is available with online material.

TI  - Climate change threatens native potential agroforestry plant species in Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of species extinction in the twentyfirst-century. Here, we (1) quantify potential changes in species' bioclimatic area of habitat (BAH) of 135 native potential agroforestry species from the Brazilian flora, using two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and dispersal scenarios, where species have no ability to disperse and reach new areas (non-dispersal) and where species can migrate within the estimated BAH (full dispersal) for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We then (2) assess the preliminary conservation status of each species based on IUCN criteria. Current and future potential habitats for species were predicted using MaxEnt, a machine-learning algorithm used to estimate species' probability distribution. Future climate is predicted to trigger a mean decline in BAH between 38.5-56.3% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 22.3-41.9% under the full dispersal scenario for 135 native potential agroforestry species. Additionally, we found that only 4.3% of the studied species could be threatened under the IUCN Red List criteria B1 and B2. However, when considering the predicted quantitative habitat loss due to climate change (A3c criterion) the percentages increased between 68.8-84.4% under the non-dispersal scenario and between 40.7-64.4% under the full dispersal scenario. To lessen such threats, we argue that encouraging the use of these species in rural and peri-urban agroecosystems are promising, complementary strategies for their long-term conservation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation forest is an important part of forest ecosystems, which plays an important role in global forest resources. Plantation forests have positive contributions to the supply of material products , the service and improvement of ecological environment , the construction of ecological landscape and response to global changes. In this study, we analyzed the function and stability of plantation forest, and the function and mechanism of rubber-based agroforestry system in the regulation and utilization of resources, including light, heat, water, nutrient, land, and space. We examined the influence of rubber-based agroforestry system on ecological services , including water conservation and the enhancement of system stability, micro-meteorological environment, soil quality, and biodiversity. After that, we proposed that future research should focus on the formation mechanism and regulation of productivity of rubber-based agroforestry system, the maintenance mechanism of rubber agroforestry system, the multi-functional service and regulation of rubber agroforestry system , and the response of rubber agroforestry system to global climate change.

TI  - Research trend: Hidden diamonds - The values and risks of online repository documents for forest policy and governance analysis
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sound forest policy and governance analysis requires rich empirical evidence, collected through the use of a (possibly) combination of various scientific methods. Scientific communities are currently offered with abundance of digital data, information and scientific materials, made fully or partially available through the explosive development of various types of online repositories. Nonetheless, the rich treasures are not optimally used in forest policy and governance analysis yet. We analysed how researchers can make use of online repositories, analysing their values and risks. Using the case of community forestry policy and elaborating the Indonesian contexts, we have observed several types of online institutional and non-profit repositories, archiving valuable documents/ materials for qualitative inquiries. Valuable materials found from the observed online repositories include policy documents (laws, regulations, decrees), local journal articles, biophysical and socio-demographic data, groups' constitutions, community forestry rights and agreements, local maps, as well as graphics and photos. We understand the concerns about the scientific quality of the repository materials. Before utilising them, researchers are encouraged to have clear visions and objectives on the types of materials relevant to their studies.

TI  - Growth and photosynthetic responses of Gallesia integrifolia (Spreng.) Harms and Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi seedlings in dense shade
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the growth and photosynthetic behavior of Gallesia integrifolia ('pau-d'alho') and Schinus terebinthifolius ('aroeirinha') under shade, seeking to obtain ecophysiological information for introducing seedlings of those species in previously established cacao agroforestry systems. Considering that light intensity under the shade of cacao trees varied between 5 and 10% daylight, 5 months old seedlings were exposed to four irradiance levels (25, 17, 10 and 5% daylight) for 92 days. With shade increase both species displayed trends of decrease leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf area per plant (LA), relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR), and increase leaf area ratio (LAR). The mean values of light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (P (nmax)) in 25 and 5% daylight were 12.8 and 8.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for G. integrifolia and 17.9 and 7.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for S. terebinthifolius. Based on the measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density and estimated values of photosynthetic saturated irradiance (Is) we concluded that, in all shaded conditions, the leaves of both species were under sub optimal light conditions to reach P (nmax). In spite of the lowest P (nmax) values, RGR and NAR were significantly higher for G. integrifolia in all irradiance levels. Differences in growth rates can be explained by the higher values of LA, LAR and leaf mass ratio (LMR), as well as by the lower values of Is, photosynthetic compensation irradiance and dark respiration rates observed for G. integrifolia. Even though seedlings of G. integrifolia presented higher capacity to adapt under conditions of dense shade, we concluded that both species were under stress conditions induced by shade in light environments below 25% daylight. On a practical point of view it is possible to conclude that seedlings of both species should be introduced in light gaps, formed after the fall of big trees, or in places in which cacao trees are cultivated using large plant spacing.

AB  - The gastronomical use of wild and native foods has gained the attention of chefs around the world in the search for new flavors. To make use of such foods also helps in the preservation of local and native flora. Native plants should be reconsidered throughout their value chain, linking their socio-cultural importance, their health benefits and their economic advantages to local communities. Brazil has the richest flora in the world, with more than 56 thousand species of plants, corresponding to almost 20% of the world flora. The Atlantic Forest biome has around 20,000 plant species. Acca sellowiana is one of the native fruits of the highland region in southern Brazilian and it grows wild in the Atlantic Forest biome. The physical, chemical and sensory characteristics of four different cultivars of feijoa fruits are the focus of this study. In addition, this study evaluated the potential use of feijoa fruits in gastronomy. The oven drying technique and the osmotic dehydration method can provide potential gastronomic products with Acca sellowiana, that can become an important source of income for local families. Sensory analysis and culinary preparations have demonstrated that the wild feijoa fruits, via agroforestry production techniques, have a specific sensory niche since they imparts a "terroir" taste. The Helena feijoa cultivar presents stronger floral, sweet flavors than the other cultivars, and also is the largest in size and has the highest values for total soluble solids and a high pH. This study shows that there is a potential to develop new products with feijoa using the fruit, flower or leaves. The wide array of products developed with feijoa during the study such as chutney, sorbet, compote and spice powder, showed that gastronomy has an important role in maintaining local biodiversity while developing sustainable gastronomical products.

T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The region of Volta Grande do Xingu River, in the state of Para, presents several kinds of land use ranging from extensive cattle farming to agroforestry, and deforestation. Currently, the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant affects the region. We present a checklist of amphibians and reptiles of the region and discuss information regarding the spatial distribution of the assemblies based on results of Environmental Programmes conducted in the area. We listed 109 amphibian (Anura, Caudata, and Gymnophiona) and 150 reptile (Squamata, Testudines, and Crocodylia) species. The regional species richness is still considered underestimated, considering the taxonomic uncertainty, complexity and cryptic diversity of various species, as observed in other regions of the Amazon biome. Efforts for scientific collection and studies related to integrative taxonomy are needed to elucidate uncertainties and increase levels of knowledge of the local diversity.

TI  - AGROFORESTRY AS A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULARIZATION OF RURAL CONSOLIDATED OCCUPATIONS
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The great expectation about the New Forest Code consisted in reducing the hermeneutics distortions and increasing legal certainty for farmers. However, the new legislation raised more uncertainties and discussions, mainly because it consolidates the anthropic use and allows of low-impact activities in areas that should, by law, be kept untouched. This study aimed to survey and to describe the legislation related to protected areas on the rural area (APP and RL), to analyze the consolidated forms of use, occupation and low impact activities that can be developed in these areas, and to propose sustainable technical alternatives for interventions in the areas already consolidated and their recovery. The text is based on literature and documents, elaborated on the survey and study of legal aspects about protected areas in rural properties of Brazil and the main low-impact farming techniques, highlighting the agroforestry systems as an alternative of consolidated occupations in environmental protection areas. The text provides in an organized way the main aspects of the legislation on such areas and describes the sustainable activities allowed in APP and RL according to the flexibility of the new Forest Code.

TI  - Using nighttime lights to assess infrastructure expansion within and around protected areas in South America
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are important mechanisms for conserving biodiversity and buffering anthropogenic pressures, but the expansion and intensification of human activities within and around PAs are threatening the biological diversity they are designed to protect. In South America, a region which includes many biodiversity hotspots (e.g., Atlantic Forest, Andes), agriculture, mining, oil and gas exploitation, dam construction, and settlements have been expanding and intensifying within and around PAs. These human activities need infrastructure (e.g., buildings, logistic facilities, ports), which leads to increased pressure on PAs. In this study, we used nighttime light data and the World Database on Protected Areas to evaluate the extent of intrusion of infrastructure in PAs in South America between 2001 and 2011. Our results show that in general PAs in all of the seven IUCN categories are buffering the intrusion of infrastructure within them, but this was not the case for PAs in multiple-use categories where there was a considerable increase in infrastructure within these PAs. The largest increase in infrastructure occurred within the first 60 km from the border of the PAs, and for multiple-use categories, the peak occurred in the first 10 km. In addition, infrastructure expansion around PAs in category I showed more variability and the largest extent. Infrastructure expansion within and around PAs varied among countries. There were only 23 of the 2,902 PAs with zero expansion, 16 were located in Brazil, four in Colombia, and one in Suriname, Venezuela, and French Guiana. Ecuador and Venezuela were the two countries that had the most infrastructure expansion within and around their PAs, while Guyana and French Guiana had the least development. Presently, South America has similar to 22% of the land area under some type of protection. Hopefully, the management of PAs will improve to help buffer the impacts of human activities and improve biodiversity conservation. Unfortunately, our results show that opposite, infrastructure is expanding within and around the PAs, which will most likely lead to ecological degradation and isolation of many of these PAs.

TI  - Effects of land-use system on the soil macrofauna in western Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are presented as a valuable alternative to pastures to sustain crop production in forested areas. In order to evaluate their effect on soil macroinvertebrate communities, sampling was conducted during the rainy season at four localities located in the Rondonia and Acre states of Brazil. Four land-use systems were selected (fallow, annual crop, agroforestry systems and pasture), and compared to nearby disturbed forests. We used the sampling method recommended by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme. Soil macrofauna responded more readily than soil parameters to different cultivation practices. Co-inertia analysis, however, showed a relationship between soil parameters and soil macrofauna. Comparison of communities showed a significant impact of land-use practices. All systems ad quite abundant invertebrate communities with relatively low densities in the forest (884 ind. m(-2)) and in pastures (841 ind. m(-2)), and higher densities in fallow, agroforestry system and annual crop (1,7371,761 ind. m(-2)). Earthworms were dominant in pastures (155 ind. m(-2) and 56.2 g m(-2) on average), whereas termites thrived better in annual crops and fallows (with respective densities of 1,287 and 816 and biomasses of 2.32 and 1.38 g m(-2)). Macrofauna communities in agroforestry systems were rather similar to the forest, in spite of higher densities of social insects. The termite:earthworm ratios were very low in pastures (0.2), had similar values in the forest (7.9) and the agroforestry system (8.8), which is much lower than in fallows (20.4) and annual crops (21.4) This study showed that all land-use practices were able to sustain sizeable macrofaunal communities with agroforestry communities rather similar to the those of a disturbed forest.

TI  - Adoption of agroforestry innovations in Barra do Turvo (Sao Paulo, Brazil)
T2  - Cahiers Agricultures
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has been developed for six years in Barra do Turvo. In this district of the Vale do Ribeira, the poorest area of the State of Sao Paulo, in Brazil, these farming systems bring technical alternatives to the family agriculture in crisis facing many problems: drop of soil fertility, rigid environmental laws, shortage of land and difficulties with the commercialization of products. In 2002, less than 10% of family farms in the district were involved in the process of technical change towards agroforestry. Theses new farming systems are developed according to a model used in a similar context, in the Mata Atlantica (Brazilian Atlantic forest), which is degraded by agricultural activities. Agroforestry "based on regeneration" rests on the principle of plant species succession and aims at a sound management of natural resources. In Barra do Turvo, this model is often used in abandoned banana plantations but also on soils degraded by practices unadapted to sloping and erosion-prone lands. In other situations, the innovation is simply added to traditional farming systems (combination of trees and crops, improved fallows using Cajanus cajan, enriched forests). By means of a monthly survey of farms over one year, technico-economical and social impacts of the introduction of these systems were evaluated. Farmers have developed different strategies regarding innovation: some of them have mastered the agroforestry techniques of the model, sometimes transforming the products of agroforestry; others are producers in transition who combine crops and agroforestry techniques or use agroforestry to diversify their livelihood systems. Finally, some farmers are only interested in agroforestry to get resources from the project and a means of commercialization. The agroforestry project provides farmers with a regular income. The income of farmers without cows or of farmers who are in the process of capital accumulation with animals is improved but work productivity is not greater than in shifting cultivation. However, the introduction of agroforestry is economically risky because above all it requires a lot of work. In addition, the average cost of implanting agroforestry is lower than the cost of systems that have the same aim of covering the soil. As for the social impact, new jobs are created. Also, farmers are becoming more aware of environmental issues. However, at the same time inter-generation conflicts and exclusion appear. On the other hand, farmers' networks are activated or re-activated (mutual aid groups working in agroforestry and organizations of producers for commercialization): meeting and discussion places are created, which is very favorable for mobilizing of knowledge and for creating new common norms. In conclusion, this study of impacts shows that subsidizing agroforestry is legitimate in pursuing sustainable development. But it also shows the many deficiencies of the agroforestry project. The actual access to markets should be re-enforced, involving as much as possible the producers in searching new ways of commercialization. It is also important to re-enforce the technical follow-up and to better exploit local biodiversity and new vegetal species to be introduced. Finally, it is essential to guarantee the right of using the native species that are present in the future agroforests to ensure the sustainability of these perennial systems.

CP  - 1st International Symposium on Chemistry of the Amazon
CL  - MANAUS, BRAZIL
AB  - Tropical rainforests contain a disproprotionate amount of the earth's biodiversity. The Brazilian Amazon is probably the most important biotic reserve in the world and provides an opportunity to test the prospects for making conservation of biodiversity an attractive alternative to its inexorable destruction by local communities. This is no easy task and requires new types of relationships with these communities in order to access their knowledge base on the use of the region's biodiversity and evaluate its potential economic value. Chemistry may play an important role in the identification, development and commercialization of valuable natural products (especially these that reveal some form of bioactivity) and in recovery of degraded areas with native species through specialized agroforestry systems as well as in monitoring and evaluating the impacts of any new project on its particular ecosystem.

TI  - Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nematodes in a 14 years no-tillage chronosequence
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of the conversion of native areas of the Cerrado to no-tillage on the population of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nematodes. Three areas under no-tillage (7, 11 and 14 years of cultivation) were evaluated and compared to adjacent areas of the Cerrado not impacted by agriculture. Results indicated that although no-tillage is a conservation system, it has either slightly reduced, slightly improved, or maintained the taxonomic and functional diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nematodes, even after 14 years of cultivation. In addition, cultivated areas presented reduced diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and increased occurrence of plant parasitic nematodes. The observed differences could be a result of both disturbance to the soil structure through agriculture and reduced plant diversity in the soybean-corn rotation, as compared to the adjacent uncultivated Cerrado.

AB  - Monoculture Falcataria moluccana plantation managed by local communities in Ciamis - West Java, is facing a gall-rust disease caused by fungal pathogen Uromycladium tepperianum. A mixed planting crops system is considered less vulnerable to pests and disease problems. In addition, it is possible to increase the productivity of community forest plantations. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of mixed-crops plantation on the productivity of F. moluccana and the incidence and severity of gall-rust in the plantation. Then it will be compared to the existed monoculture F. moluccana plantation in the area, that was established two years before. The mixed-crop consisted of F. moluccana, Acacia mangium, and Gmelina arborea. These were alternately planted in three different rows with three replications. The observations of growth increments as well as incidence and severity of gallrust were carried out in 1.5 years after planting. The results showed that the annual height- and diameter- increments of F. moluccana in the mixed-crop plot were 331.2 cm and 2.77 cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the results in the monoculture plot were 325.62 cm and 2.64 cm. The survival rates of F. moluccana in both planting patterns were slightly different (85.3% and 88%). Gall-rust incidence and severity were only observed in the F. moluccana monoculture plot, i.e., 0.15% and 0.48%, respectively. The mixed-planting crops system seems possible to be applied for controlling the gall-rust disease that attacked the F. moluccana stands Further research on comparing the similar ages of mono- and mixed- cultures of F. moluccana in different locations were suggested.

TI  - Landscape heterogeneity increases bird functional diversity within Neotropical vineyards
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Conversion of lands to agroecosystems has resulted in a decline in bird biodiversity. Analyzing functional diversity is a central tool for detecting changes in the ecological functions performed by birds in these landscapes. This paper aims to investigate the responses of bird taxonomic and functional diversity to landscape heterogeneity and native forest cover in Neotropical vineyards. We sampled 19 vineyard landscapes in southeastern Brazil. These landscapes covered a gradient of forest cover and heterogeneity resulting from various land-uses. To assess bird diversity, we considered both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity (i.e., functional richness, evenness, and divergence). To examine the potential interactions between landscapes and bird assemblages, we employed generalized linear models (GLM). Taxonomic diversity showed no correlation with any landscape metrics. On the other hand, variation in the three metrics of functional diversity was related to landscape heterogeneity. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, these communities can be structured by limiting similarity processes. We highlight the negative impact of landscape homogenization on the ecological functions performed by birds in vineyards, while finding no significant effect on species diversity. These findings can provide valuable support for the formulation of public policies aimed at striking a balance between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.A conversao global de terras em agroecossistemas resultou em declinio na biodiversidade de aves, e a analise da diversidade funcional e uma ferramenta importante para detectar mudancas nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves nesses ambientes. Este artigo tem como objetivos investigar as respostas da diversidade taxonomica e funcional de aves a heterogeneidade da paisagem e a cobertura florestal nativa (Mata Atlantica) em vinhedos neotropicais. Para isso, amostramos 19 paisagens de vinhedos no sudeste do Brasil. Essas paisagens cobriam um gradiente de cobertura florestal e heterogeneidade resultante de diferentes usos da terra. Para avaliar a diversidade de aves, consideramos tanto a diversidade taxonomica quanto a diversidade funcional (ou seja, riqueza funcional, uniformidade funcional e divergencia funcional). Para examinar as interacoes potenciais entre as paisagens e as assembleias de aves, empregamos modelos lineares generalizados (GLM). A diversidade taxonomica nao mostrou correlacao com nenhuma metrica da paisagem. Por outro lado, a variacao nas tres metricas da diversidade funcional foi relacionada a heterogeneidade da paisagem. No entanto, em paisagens heterogeneas, essas comunidades podem ser estruturadas por processos de similaridade limitante. Destacamos o impacto negativo da homogeneizacao da paisagem nas funcoes ecologicas desempenhadas por aves em vinhedos, porem nao encontramos efeito significativo na diversidade de especies. Esses resultados podem fornecer um arcabouco valioso para a formulacao de politicas publicas voltadas para encontrar um equilibrio entre producao agricola e conservacao da biodiversidade.This study examines the correlation between landscape heterogeneity and native forest cover on bird functional diversity within Neotropical vineyards in southeastern Brazil. The key findings underscore a positive relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird functional diversity, underscoring the need of preserving diverse habitats within agroecosystems to strike a balance between food production and biodiversity conservation.image

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the carbon stock in the different designs of biodiverse agroforestry systems (AFSs) in the region of the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of Pratigi, Bahia, Brazil. Phytosociology aspects related to the potentiality of carbon stock of 10 farms were evaluated using plots of 10 x 50 m allocated in each AFS, inventorying 928 individuals of 17 families and 37 species, established in 2013. The biomass above and below the soil of the arboreal individuals were estimated by indirect method, using specific allometric equations for each species or group of species, with diameter above 1 cm. Carbon stock (CS) was estimated from the biomass. Cacao (Theobroma cacao) and rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) were the dominant species in all of the designs, which also contained fruit trees, and native and exotic shade trees. There was variation of the estimate of carbon stock (8.01-1.42 Mg ha(-1)) between the types of AFSs. The designs with a larger relative density of fruit and shade trees led to larger carbon storage, influenced by the wealth and diversity of species in the initial phase of establishment of biodiverse AFSs.

TI  - Response of the ant assemblage to a gradient of environmental change in the soil-litter interface
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the response of the assemblage of ants that nest in the soil-litter interface to a gradient of environmental change. Fieldwork was carried out in three environments under different land use regimes: a forest fragment, an agroforestry system (AFS), and a pasture, all located within the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. In each environment we marked ten 1-m(2) plots and recorded all ant nests found within them. We recorded 215 nests (103 in the forest, 64 in the AFS, and 48 in the pasture) of 31 species. The cumulative number of species was higher in the forest than in the pasture; the forest and the AFS differed from the pasture, but did not differ from each other. Species composition differed between the forest and the other two environments. The average species richness was high in the forest and low in the pasture. The amount of litter did not explain the differences in species richness among environments. Human activities that reduce vegetation heterogeneity change the composition and reduce the richness of the ant assemblage.

TI  - Soil macrofauna in a chronosequence of fallows, old-growth forests and pastures in the Belem Endemism Center, Eastern Amazon
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Belem Endemism Center (CEB; the biogeographic region located between the Tocantins and Pindare rivers) is the most deforested area of the Amazon. To study the soil biota of the remaining old-growth and second-growth forests is essential to promote more sustainable farming practices, and provide orientation for degraded land restoration. The aim of this study was to identify the main determinants of the composition and diversity of major taxa of soil macrofauna (current soil use, geographic centers, soil use history, fire frequency) in a chronosequence of fallows and forests in the CEB. Macrofauna was sampled in eight sites of young secondary forests (4-7 y), six sites of medium secondary forests (11-15 y), seven sites of "old" secondary forests (20-40 y), eight sites of old-growth forest remnants and three sites of pastures. Its composition and diversity were analysed through Principal Component and Between-class Analyses. A total of 9.225 individuals from 29 major taxa (orders or families) were collected in the 32 plots. Soil macrofauna composition was very sensitive to soil use history and identified different communities among geographic centers. The intensity of soil use decreased the abundance and richness of predators, indicating long-lasting impacts of soil degradation on macrofauna composition and diversity, and therefore on soil ecological functions.

TI  - Better together: integrating mist-nets and bioacoustics reveals large-scale native vegetation as a key predictor of bat community conservation in a fragmented landscape
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss, fragmentation, and land conversion for human use are currently the main drivers of biodiversity loss in the Neotropics. Agropastoral and silvicultural activities are especially important, as they have expanded in the last decades due to the increasing demand for global food and wood production. This presents a challenge in developing management strategies that balance biodiversity conservation with productivity, which can only be achieved through a better understanding of biodiversity responses to landscape changes. In this study, we investigated how landscape changes affect the species richness, relative abundance, and species composition of a bat community in a fragmented landscape in southeastern Brazil, using an approach that integrates data from mist-nets and bioacoustics. Forest cover at intermediate and large scales was the best predictor of bat richness and relative abundance, as well as the relative abundance of frugivorous bats. For open and edge space aerial insectivorous bats, landscape variables did not have a strong explanatory power, suggesting that other variables may better predict their relative abundance. Our study highlights the importance of using multiple sampling methods to study Neotropical bats, as well as the importance of the multiscale approach to evaluate landscape effects on biological communities.

TI  - Dragonflies (Odonata) as bioindicators of the sustainability of agroforestry systems in the Atlantic Forest.
T2  - Aquatic Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities constitute a major threat to the physical and ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Among the various anthropogenic impacts, alterations in land use and occupation patterns stand out as key drivers of aquatic ecosystem degradation and loss. In this context, agroforestry systems stand out among various land uses as an alternative for reducing environmental impacts. This study evaluated the integrity of streams in the Atlantic Forest under different land use types and their effects on dragonfly larval assemblages. Dragonfly larvae were collected in native forests, pastures, and cocoa cultivation areas, known locally as Cabruca (an agroforestry system in which Atlantic Forest trees are partially preserved, and cacao is planted in the understory). Our results revealed a difference in genus richness among the studied areas, with Cabruca areas showing higher richness and pasture areas exhibiting lower richness. We also observed variations in species composition, with native areas displaying a more homogeneous composition and pasture areas exhibiting a more heterogeneous composition. In addition, our results indicated that dragonfly larvae can serve as excellent indicators of sustainable cultivation areas. Although Cabruca areas represent a model of sustainable agriculture with the potential to contribute to biodiversity preservation, this study emphasizes that such areas cannot fully replace native habitats, reiterating the importance of conserving the remaining forests and their biodiversity.

TI  - Woody encroachment affects multiple dimensions of ant diversity in a neotropical savanna
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Although savanna woody encroachment has become a global phenomenon, relatively little is known about its effects on multiple dimensions and levels of savanna biodiversity.2. Using a combination of field surveys, a species-level phylogeny, and functional metrics drawn from a morphological dataset, we evaluated how the progressive increase in tree cover in a fire-suppressed savanna landscape affects the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of neotropical ant communities, at both the alpha and beta levels. Ants were sampled along an extensive tree cover gradient, ranging from open savannas to forests established in former savanna areas.3. Variation in tree cover had a significant influence on all facets of diversity at the beta level, whereas at the alpha level tree cover variation affected the taxonomic and functional but not the phylogenetic diversity of the ant communities.4. In general, ant community responses to variation in tree cover were largely non-linear as differences in taxonomic alpha diversity and in the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic composition of the sampled communities were often much stronger at the savanna/forest transition than at any other part of the gradient. This indicates that savanna ant communities switch rapidly to an alternative state once the savanna turns into forest.5. Ant communities in the newly formed forest areas lacked many of the species typical of the savanna habitats, suggesting that the maintenance of a fire suppression policy is likely to result in a decrease in ant diversity and in the homogenisation of the ant fauna at the landscape scale.

TI  - Expansion of soybean farming into deforested areas in the amazon biome: the role and impact of the soy moratorium
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 1990s and 2000s, soybean farming grew sharply, particularly in states located in Brazil's mid-west region. To curb deforestation, the Federal Government implemented command and control policies and, at the same time, soy-buying companies and Civil Society Organizations implemented the Soy Moratorium. This paper focused on the major role of these initiatives in decreasing soybean farming in areas deforested after 2006 and their importance in achieving this result. We considered rich database deforestation, and soybean planted area based on highly detailed remote sensing images, combined with explanatory variables of different sources, forming a panel data of 287 municipalities over 8 years. Spatial panel data models are implemented to avoid any spatial correlation problems and to analyze relationships through regional units and time. The results confirm that lower deforestation rates in the biome laid the foundation for reducing soybean farming in the Amazon biome. However, since 2008, when the Soy Moratorium was launched, there was a structural decline in this relationship that was decisive for a decoupling of soybean farming from deforestation. Therefore, government programs to reduce deforestation made room for a new environment for agricultural expansion in line with Brazilian law and environmental commitments. The Soy Moratorium reinforced this new order, and this production chain became a case study on public and private governance, given its importance in reducing soybean farming in deforested areas after the cut-off date. These public and private effects stress the importance of coordinated actions to achieve efficient results, especially in a large social and environmentally complex region as the Brazilian Amazon, to halt biodiversity degradation and increase participation in value added markets.

TI  - Can agroforest woodlots work as stepping stones for birds in the Atlantic forest region?
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In fragmented landscapes, agroforest woodlots can potentially act as stepping stones facilitating movement between forest fragments. We assessed the influence of agroforest woodlots on bird distribution and diversity in the Atlantic forest region (SE Brazil), and also tested which categories of species can use different types of connection elements, and whether this use is influenced by the distance to large forest patches. We studied two fragmented landscapes, with and without stepping stones linking large fragments, and one forested landscape. Using a point count, a bird survey was undertaken in the fragmented landscapes in five different elements: large remnants (> 400 ha), agroforest woodlots (0.4-1.1 ha), small patches (0.5-7 ha), riparian corridor, and pasture areas (the main matrix). Generalist and open-area species were commonly observed in the agroforest system or other connection elements, whereas only a few forest species were present in these connections. For the latter species, the distance of woodlots to large patches was essential to determine their richness and abundance. Based on our results and data from literature, we suggest that there is an optimal relationship between the permeability of the matrix and the efficiency of stepping stones, which occurs at intermediate degrees of matrix resistance, and is species-dependent. Because the presence of agroforest system favors a higher richness of generalist species, they appeared to be more advantageous for conservation than the monoculture system; for this reason, they should be considered as a management alternative, particularly when the matrix permeability requirement is met.

TI  - Phosphorus adsorption in a degraded soil under forestry recovery after bauxite mining in Paragominas, eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability and retention of phosphorus (P) in soils under recovery process after mining operations play an important role in the management of this nutrient. The objective of this study was to evaluate the P adsorption in a reconstituted soil as a function of two forest recovery processes after bauxite mining. We evaluated three systems: native forest (FOR), planting of forest seedlings after bauxite mining (TPL), and natural regeneration of vegetation after bauxite mining (NRV). In each system, eight sampling plots were deployed. In each plot, we collected litter and soil samples. The soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm, for soil chemical analysis and adjustment of P adsorption isotherms. We also performed an inventory of the tree vegetation to obtain basal area (G) and species diversity (H '). Forest was significantly superior with respect to most soil fertility, litter, and vegetation attributes, followed by natural regeneration and planting. In general, the adsorption curves and maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) in soil followed the order planting > natural regeneration > forest. We observed a negative relationship between phosphorus adsorption and soil organic matter, potential acidity, and available phosphorus. This result highlights the importance of biomass conservation and maintenance to ensure phosphorus availability in reclamation practices. Furthermore, such results indicate that both soil cover and plant species diversity should be considered when selecting species to improve P availability for reclamation of mined areas.

TI  - The earthworm fauna of regenerating forests and anthropogenic habitats in the coastal region of Parana
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate abundance, biomass and diversity of earthworms in the southern coast region of the Mata Atlantica biodiversity hotspot. A total of 51 study sites in pastures, banana monocultures, mixed agroforestry systems, secondary forests in succession and old-growth forests near the coast of Parana, Brazil, were evaluated. Each site was sampled once. Species richness of the earthworms was generally low and varied little between sites. At all sites except for one, the peregrine species Pontoscolex corethrurus (Glossoscolecidae) strongly dominated. Three other peregrine species, Amynthas corticis, Amynthas gracilis (Megascolecidae) and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis (Ocnerodrilidae), were frequent in moist sites. No autochthonous species were found. Abundance and biomass of earthworms varied strongly within and between sites (0-338 individuals m(-2), 0-96 g m(-2) fresh weight). Pastures had significantly lower abundance than all other sites. The forest sites had similar earthworm abundance and biomass, with a tendency to be higher in younger succession stages. The coastal plain region has been strongly altered by human activities. Reasons for the lack of any autochthonous species and the dominance of one peregrine species require further investigation.

TI  - Trophic niche differentiation and utilisation of food resources in Collembola is altered by rainforest conversion to plantation systems
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.

TI  - Stand-level management practices increase occupancy by birds in exotic Eucalyptus plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing for wildlife in human-dominated matrices outside natural reserves has great importance to improve the efficacy of conservation efforts aiming to protect and restore biodiversity. As such, it is critical to understand which features of the matrix enhance habitat suitability to the remaining species and also to evaluate species responses to alternative management practices. We used hierarchical modeling to estimate the effect of stand level management practices adopted in Eucalyptus plantations on site occupancy by birds while accounting for species detection failure. Our models incorporated site-specific traits, such as management practice type and landscape attributes of each sampling unit. They also incorporate species-specific traits, particularly main foraging stratum. The major factor associated with differences in site occupancy by birds within our study site is the management practice type. Scattered native trees and early successional stage understory within mature stands were associated with an increase in the proportion of bird species from the regional pool that was able to occupy the silvicultural matrix. Landscape attributes had a relatively minor effect on site occupancy in our study area. We concluded that site occupancy by birds is positively associated with increasing spatial complexity within Eucalyptus stands, with species responding to the retention of native scattered trees and understory presence. Forestry managers interested in improving the conservation value for birds of Eucalyptus plantations in tropical areas should maintain existing native trees and adopt practices that trigger understory regeneration during site preparation and stand rotation.

TI  - Effects of environmental attributes on the biodiversity of ants under different land uses
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the influence of environmental variables on the ant fauna, in cultivated areas and in a native forest fragment. The data were collected in the municipality of Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro state, in the rainy and dry seasons, in a banana plantation (Musa pariadisiaca L.), an agroforest, a coffee plantation (Coffea conephora Pierre) shaded with Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) and a forest fragment (8 ha) in the intermediate stage of secondary succession. For the sampling, soil pitfall traps and the Winkler extractor were used. A total of 53 species were collected in the present study. The highest species richness was observed in the agroforestry (38 species), followed by shaded coffee (31 species), secondary forest (29 species) and banana plantation (28 species). In the dry season there was effect of land use type and leaf litter depth on the richness and diversity of ant species. In both seasons, ant species composition varied significantly among all the studied areas. The agroforestry systems are important alternatives to monocultures due to their diversity of cultivated species and plant strata. Thus, the increase of the structural heterogeneity of the environment and the leaf litter depth, in cultivated areas in the dry season, may lead to greater species richness and diversity as well as changes in the species composition.

TI  - Soil fertility and carbon and nitrogen stocks under agroforestry systems in the Cerrado of Minas Gerais State
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are used to diversify food production, provide an increase in the biodiversity of fauna and flora as well as the conservation of carbon and nutrients in the soil. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the fertility and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks of the soil after ten years of agroforestry system (SAFs) implantation in the Cerrado biome of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The study was carried out in the American Agroextractivist Settlement, located in the municipality of Grao Mogol, northern mesoregion of the state of Minas Gerais. Three SAFs and two adjacent native vegetation areas (VNs) were used as reference for the study, which were grouped according to the soil class: Red-Yellow Latosol and Haplic Cambisol. The soil sampling was carried out in March 2013, ten years after the implementation of the SAFs, where composite samples were removed from the 0-5 and 0-20 cm soil depth layers for the evaluation of nutrient contents and apparent density, and in the first layer the soil C and N stocks. SAFs that were deployed with management based on prune trees and maintenance of floristic diversity contributed with the improvement of the soil quality and the maintenance of fertility and C stocks at levels like in native vegetation. On the other hand, the SAF that was implanted with the previous suppression of the native vegetation reduced the tree diversity and, consequently, the C stocks over time. However management with annual crops and the use of legumes contributed to the improvement of soil fertility an to the increase of N contents and stocks.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF THE WEED FLORA IN RICE AREAS UNDER DISTINCT CROPPING SYSTEMS AND HERBICIDE MANAGEMENTS
T2  - PLANTA DANINHA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of weeds in flooded rice areas, as a function of planting system and herbicide programmes in the previous cropping year. The experiment was installed in field conditions, in randomized complete blocks design, arranged in factorial scheme 3 x 2, with eight replications. In factor A, treatments consisted on conventional tillage, minimum tillage and no till cropping systems, coupled to the application (traditional control) or not (semiecological system) of herbicides (Factor B). One year after rice cultivation, preceding the planting of the next cropping season, phytosociological evaluations of the weed communities present in the treatments were carried out. We assessed the overall infestation level and weed species composition, which were classified by their respective density, frequency and dominance abilities. We also estimated the diveisity coefficients of Simpson and Shannon Weiner, and the sustainability coefficient of Shannon; treatments were also grouped by similarity in weed species composition. Rice growing systems (traditional or semi-ecological) promote remarkable differences in weed occurrence. Herbicide-based crops select specific companion weed species, but crop rotation or winter cover crops are not a sine qua non condition for success since a good herbicide programme is planned. For the Semi ecological system, crop rotation, thick winter soil mulching and association with animal presence and grazing are essential for the short, medium and long-term inhibition of weeds.

TI  - Measuring the Conservation Value of Tropical Primary Forests: The Effect of Occasional Species on Estimates of Biodiversity Uniqueness
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Developing effective conservation plans for multi-functional landscapes requires an accurate knowledge of the relative conservation value of different land-uses. A growing number of tropical ecologists have evaluated conservation value using the number (or proportion) of species that are unique to primary or old-growth forests. However, estimates of the conservation value of modified land-uses may be inflated by the presence of occasional species (e. g. singletons and doubletons) that may be unable to exist as viable populations in isolation.Methodology/Principal Findings: We use a unique 15-taxa dataset from a mixed-use forest landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the hypothesis that the removal of occasional species from sample data can increase estimates of the value of primary forest for biodiversity conservation.Conclusions/Significance: Estimates of conservation value that are based on the proportion of species that are unique to tropical primary or old-growth forests are highly sensitive to decisions researchers make regarding the inclusion or exclusion of occasional species. By removing singletons from modified forest samples, and considering only those species known to occur in primary forest, we almost double estimates of the conservation value of tropical primary forests.

TI  - Where matrix quality most matters? Using connectivity models to assess effectiveness of matrix conversion in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Great interest has been devoted to understand how agricultural matrix managements affect species flux in the patchy landscapes and agroforestry systems are known to enhance connectivity for forest dwelling species. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, high degree of fragmentation makes the implementation or the conservation of the existing agroforestry systems keystone to connectivity conservation. We located places in the Atlantic Forest where agroforestry restoration is more effective in terms of connectivity conservation using a multi-scale approach. We conducted a large scale regional analysis to identify regions in which matrix conversion has larger effect on bird functional connectivity. Furthermore, we conducted two separate local analyses in the landscape which accounted for high restoration effectiveness in the regional analysis. One was the overlap with the Forest Code debt map to assess where and how much land-owners must restore as obligated bylaw. The second local analyses consisted in locating areas which least cost path trajectories density is larger within the selected landscape. Matrix restoration effort would be largely maximized by acting on specific places, and multi-scale and interdisciplinary models that account for the biological response of biodiversity and contextualizes under environmental laws will foster effective conservation policies.

TI  - Extinction threat to neglected Plinia edulis exacerbated by climate change, yet likely mitigated by conservation through sustainable use
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting the impacts of climate change on species distribution has several implications for conservation. Plinia edulis is a rare and threatened tree species from Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. In this study, we assessed the impact of global climate change on the distribution of P. edulis. Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of the Brazilian protected network to conserve this species. Ecological niche models were built using the maximum entropy method based on occurrence records and environmental predictors. Models predicted a reduction of climatically suitable areas for P. edulis in all evaluated scenarios in the coming years. Furthermore, we observed that Brazilian protected areas (PAs) are ineffective to conserve this species. Given the fact that P. edulis is a promising tree species rarely found within Brazilian PAs and threatened by global climate change, we strongly recommend the cultivation of this multipurpose species in agroforestry systems, landscaping and homegardens in order to promote its conservation through sustainable use.

TI  - Patterns and predictors of β-diversity in the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest: a multiscale analysis of forest specialist and generalist birds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Biodiversity maintenance in human-altered landscapes (HALs) depends on the species turnover among localities, but the patterns and determinants of beta-diversity in HALs are poorly known. In fact, declines, increases and neutral shifts in beta-diversity have all been documented, depending on the landscape, ecological group and spatial scale of analysis.2. We shed some light on this controversy by assessing the patterns and predictors of bird beta-diversity across multiple spatial scales considering forest specialist and habitat generalist bird assemblages.3. We surveyed birds from 144 point counts in 36 different forest sites across two landscapes with different amount of forest cover in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We analysed beta-diversity among points, among sites and between landscapes with multiplicative diversity partitioning of Hill numbers. We tested whether beta-diversity among points was related to within-site variations in vegetation structure, and whether beta-diversity among sites was related to site location and/or to differences among sites in vegetation structure and landscape composition (i.e. per cent forest and pasture cover surrounding each site).4. beta-diversity between landscapes was lower than among sites and among points in both bird assemblages. In forest specialist birds, the landscape with less forest cover showed the highest b-diversity among sites (bird differentiation among sites), but generalist birds showed the opposite pattern. At the local scale, however, the less forested landscape showed the lowest beta-diversity among points (bird homogenization within sites), independently of the bird assemblage. beta-diversity among points was weakly related to vegetation structure, but higher beta-diversity values were recorded among sites that were more isolated from each other, and among sites with higher differences in landscape composition, particularly in the less forested landscape.5. Our findings indicate that patterns of bird beta-diversity vary across scales and are strongly related to landscape composition. Bird assemblages are shaped by both environmental filtering and dispersal limitation, particularly in less forested landscapes. Conservation and management strategies should therefore prevent deforestation in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Trends in Agroforestry Research from 1993 to 2022: A Topic Model Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and HJ-Biplot
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is an immense debate about the factors that could limit the adoption of agroforestry systems. However, one of the most important is the generation of scientific information that supports the viability and benefits of the proposed techniques. Statistical analysis: This work used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling method to identify and interpret scientific information on topics in relation to existing categories in a set of documents. It also used the HJ-Biplot method to determine the relationship between the analyzed topics, taking into consideration the years under study. Results: A review of the literature was conducted in this study and a total of 9794 abstracts of scientific articles published between 1993 and 2022 were obtained. The United States, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Germany were the five countries that published the largest number of studies about agroforestry, particularly soil organic carbon, which was the most studied case. The five more frequently studied topics were: soil organic carbon, adoption of agroforestry practices, biodiversity, climatic change global policies, and carbon and climatic change. Conclusion: the LDA and HJ-Biplot statistical methods are useful tools for determining topicality in text analysis in agroforestry and related topics.

TI  - Evaluation of Ant Fauna Interactions in Different Land Uses.
T2  - Biodiversidade Brasileira
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the interactions of ant fauna in a dense ombrophilous forest, a diversified agroforestry system, a gliricidia shaded coffee plantation and a banana plantation that had passion fruit vines. In each of these environments three 10m x 2m transects were demarcated, where ants were collected and ecological interactions were evaluated. In total, 30 species of ants were observed and collected, the greatest species richness observed in agroforestry, as well as the greatest record of interactions. The smallest richness and the smallest record of interactions occurred in the coffee plantations. Based on the results of this study, it is possible to verify that, among the cultivation systems studied, the agroforestry system is the most recommended for the protection of ant biodiversity, as it preserves the largest number of species and interactions.

TI  - EFFECT OF SOIL TILLAGE AND SUGARCANE TRASH ON CO2 EMISSION
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil is one of the main C pools in terrestrial ecosystem, capable of storing significant C amounts. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to the loss of CO2 from agricultural soils is critical to determine strategies reducing emissions of this gas and help mitigate the greenhouse effect. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of soil tillage and sugarcane trash on CO2 emissions, temperature and soil moisture during sugarcane (re) planting, over a study period of 15 days. The following managements were evaluated: no-tillage with crop residues left on the soil surface (NTR); without tillage and without residue (NTNR) and tillage with no residue (TNR). The average soil CO2 emission (FCO2) was lowest in NTR (2.16 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), compared to the managements NTNR (2.90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and TNR (3.22 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), indicating that the higher moisture and lower soil temperature variations observed in NTR were responsible for this decrease. During the study period, the lowest daily average FCO2 was recorded in NTR (1.28 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and the highest in TNR (6.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), after rainfall. A loss of soil CO2 was lowest from the management NTR (367 kg ha(-1) of CO2-C) and differing significantly (p<0.05) from the managements NTNR (502 kg ha(-1) of CO2-C) and TNR (535 kg ha(-1) of CO2-C). Soil moisture was the variable that differed most managements and was positively correlated (r = 0.55, p<0.05) with the temporal variations of CO2 emission from NTR and TNR. In addition, the soil temperature differed (p<0.05) only in management NTR (24 degrees C) compared to NTNR (26 degrees C) and TNR (26.5 degrees C), suggesting that under the conditions of this study, sugarcane trash left on the surface induced an average rise in the of soil temperature of 2 degrees C.

TI  - DINAMICA POPULACIONAL DE Hypothenemus hampei (COLEOPTERA: SCOLYTIDAE) SOB SISTEMA AGROFLORESTAL E MONOCULTIVO DE CAFE CONILON NO SUL DO ESTADO DO AMAZONAS, BRASIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypothenemus hampei is the main coffee pest in the Amazon and worldwide. Although coffee cultivation exists in the State of Amazonas, there is no information regarding the behavior of this species population in this region of Brazil. Since the Amazon region is a favorable environment for H. hampei, the present study aimed to investigate this insect population in the following cultivation systems implanted in the municipality of Humaita, Southern Amazonas: i) coffee in native forest (CNF), ii) coffee intercropped with cupuacu and acai (native Brazilian fruits) (CCA) and iii) coffee in monoculture (MC). Also, the climatic and phenological parameters of the plant were used in relation with the population dynamics of the insect. For that, ten baited traps were installed in each field for the monthly sampling of the H. hampei population from July/2018 to June/2019. The highest population abundance of the insect was observed during the coffee flowering season, mainly in monoculture crops, when compared to the other intercropped fields. The total mean value of the insect population observed in the three environments evaluated was highest in August/2018, with a recorded value of 1749. The increase in rainfall indexes occurred simultaneously with a decrease in the insect population; this coincides with the end of the flowering season (October/2018, 161.8 mm) and the beginning of grain formation (November/2018, 234.8 mm). The lowest abundance of the insect observed in the coffee fields in native forest, with an abundance of 83 (CNF), indicates that the local biodiversity disfavors the population size of the pest in the environment. These results suggest that phenological phases of conilon coffee and the influence of climatic conditions can result in changes in the population dynamics of the H. hampei. Coffee agroforestry systems are more promising to maintain this population at low levels.

TI  - Peat swamp forest conservation withstands pervasive land conversion to oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation remains one of the major global challenges of the twenty-first century driven to a large extent by the conversion of land for agricultural purposes, such as palm oil production. Malaysia is one of the world's largest palm oil producers and has seen widespread conversion to oil palm from primary forest, including peat swamp forest (PSF). This study investigates the rate and extent of pervasive oil palm expansion in and around North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF) over the last three decades, exploring how land conversion has affected the region's tropical forests, and assessing the relative success of PSF conservation measures. Time-series Landsat imagery was used to assess thematic land cover change and improvement in vegetation condition since NSPSF was given protected status in 1990. The results show a near tripling in oil palm cover throughout North Selangor, from 24,930ha in 1989 to 70,070ha in 2016; while at the same time tropical forest cover shrank from 145,570ha to 88,400ha. Despite concerns over the sustainability and environmental impact of such rapid oil palm conversion at a regional level, at the local scale, NSPSF represents a relative conservation success story. Effective land stewardship by government and non-governmental organization (NGO) management actors has limited illegal encroachment of oil palm around the reserve boundary. PSF rehabilitation measures have also markedly improved vegetation condition in NSPFS's interior. These findings have broad significance for how oil palm agriculture is managed and especially for PSF stewardship and conservation, and the approaches described here may be usefully adopted elsewhere in Southeast Asia and around the world.

TI  - Termite assemblage collapse along a land-use intensification gradient in lowland central Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Termites are major decomposers in tropical regions and play an important role in soil processes. This study measured the impact of land-use intensification on the termite assemblage of lowland rain forest in Jambi Province, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Termite composition was assessed in seven land-use types along a disturbance gradient, from primary forest, through different silvicultural systems, to grassland and cultivated land without trees. A range of environmental variables was also measured.2. Termite species richness and relative abundance declined as follows: primary forest > selectively logged forest > mature 'jungle rubber' (a diverse agro-forest dominated by rubber trees) > mature rubber plantation > young Paraserianthes falcataria plantation (a softwood tree) > Imperata cylindrica grassland > cassava garden. Termite richness fell from 34 species in the primary forest to one species in the cassava garden. The relative abundance of soil-feeding termites showed a significantly greater decline along the gradient than did wood-feeding termites.3. Of the environmental variables, woody plant basal area was most strongly correlated with termite species richness (r = 0.973) and relative abundance (r = 0.980). This reflects the response of forest-adapted termites to progressive simplification of the physical structure of the habitat, resulting in the reduction of canopy cover and alteration in microclimate, and the loss of feeding and nesting sites.4. Synthesis and applications . Comparisons with other studies show that the decline in termite species richness and relative abundance seen at Jambi is a general trend that occurs elsewhere when forests are converted to other land uses. To help mitigate the loss of termites when forests are disturbed, we recommend the following management practices: the use of reduced-impact logging techniques, maximizing forest patch size and connectivity, minimizing length of forest edges, and leaving dead wood to decay in situ .

TI  - Effects of habitat management on different feeding guilds of herbivorous insects in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human pressure on natural habitats increases the importance of agroforests for biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of cacao traditional cultivation system (CTCS) on the conservation of the herbivorous insect community when compared with a monodominant rubber agroforest, a type of agricultural system for cacao cultivation. The insects were sampled in three habitats in Southeastern Bahia, Brazil: native forests, CTCS and rubber agroforests. In each habitat, 18 plots of 10 m(2) were established, and the structural measures were collected and herbivorous insects were sampled with a Malaise/window trap. The diversity of folivorous decreased with the simplification of vegetation structure, but species composition was similar among habitats. In addition to a decrease in the availability of resources in monodominant rubber agroforests, the latex present in these systems have limited the occurrence of species that cannot circumvent latex toxicity. The diversity of sap-sucking insects was similar among habitats, but species composition was similar only in the CTCS and native forest, and it was different in the rubber agroforest. We observed turnover and a higher frequency of individuals of the family Psyllidae in the rubber agroforest. The biology and behavior of Psyllids and absence of natural enemies enable their diversity to increase when they are adapted to a new host. We observed a shift in the composition of xylophagous insects in the rubber agroforest compared to that in other habitats. Moreover, this agroforest has low species richness, but high individual abundance. Latex extraction is likely an important additional source of volatile compounds discharged into the environment, and it increases the attraction and recruitment of coleoborers to these sites. We concluded that CTCS has an herbivorous insect community with a structure similar to the community found in native forests of the region, and they present a more interesting conservation strategy when compared to rubber agroforests. We also emphasized the potential risk of local pest outbreaks in rubber agroforests for both the rubber and associated cacao trees.

TI  - Acrocomia spp.: neglected crop, ballyhooed multipurpose palm or fit for the bioeconomy? A review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Acrocomia spp., a genus of wild-growing palms in the neotropics, is rapidly gaining interest as a promising multipurpose crop. Diverse products can be derived from various components of the palm, the oils being of highest interest. Acrocomia shows similar oil yield and fatty acid composition to the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). It is, however, able to cope with a wider range of environmental conditions, including temporary water scarcity and lower temperatures, thus potentially a more sustainable alternative to its tropical counterpart. Acrocomia's research history is recent compared to other traditional crops and thus knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and challenges need to be addressed. This review attempts to assess the acrocomia's preparedness for cultivation by highlighting the state-of-the-art in research and identifying research gaps. Based on a systematic literature search following a value web approach, it (a) provides a comprehensive overview of research topics, (b) shows the development of publication activities over time and the drivers of this development, and (c) compiles main findings to assess the acrocomia's preparedness for commercial cultivation. Our results confirm its multipurpose characteristic as a potential feedstock for manifold sectors. Research has continued to increase over the last decade, especially on A. aculeata and is driven by the interest in bioenergy. Increasing knowledge on botany has contributed to understanding the genetic diversity and genus-specific biology. This has enabled applied research on seed germination and propagation toward domestication and initial plantation activities, mostly in Brazil. Main research gaps are associated with genotype-environment interaction, planting material, crop management, and sustainable cropping systems. Overall, we conclude that acrocomia is at an early phase of development as an alternative and multipurpose crop and its up-scaling requires the integration of sustainability strategies tailored to location-based social-ecological conditions.

TI  - The conservation value of cacao agroforestry for bird functional diversity in tropical agricultural landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao agroforestry have been considered as biodiversity-friendly farming practices by maintaining habitats for a high diversity of species in tropical landscapes. However, little information is available to evaluate whether this agrosystem can maintain functional diversity, given that agricultural changes can affect the functional components, but not the taxonomic one (e.g., species richness). Thus, considering functional traits improve the understanding of the agricultural impacts on biodiversity. Here, we measured functional diversity (functional richness-FD, functional evenness-FEve, and functional divergence-Rao) and taxonomic diversity (species richness and Simpson index) to evaluate changes of bird diversity in cacao agroforestry in comparison with nearby mature forests (old-growth forests) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used data from two landscapes with constraining areas of mature forest (49% Una and 4.8% Ilheus) and cacao agroforestry cover (6% and 82%, respectively). To remove any bias of species richness and to evaluate assembly processes (functional overdispersion or clustering), all functional indices were adjusted using null models. Our analyses considered the entire community, as well as separately for forest specialists, habitat generalists, and birds that contribute to seed dispersal (frugivores/granivores) or invertebrate removal (insectivores). Our findings showed that small cacao agroforestry in the forested landscape sustains functional diversity (FD and FEve) as diverse as nearby forests when considering the entire community, forest specialist, and habitat generalists. However, we observed declines for frugivores/granivores and insectivores (FD and Rao). These responses of bird communities differed from those observed by taxonomic diversity, suggesting that even species-rich communities in agroforestry may capture lower functional diversity. Furthermore, communities in both landscapes showed either functional clustering or neutral processes as the main driver of functional assembly. Functional clustering may indicate that local conditions and resources were changed or lost, while neutral assemblies may reveal high functional redundancy at the landscape scale. In Ilheus, the neutral assembly predominance suggests an effect of functional homogenization between habitats. Thus, the conservation value of cacao agroforestry to harbor species-rich communities and ecosystem functions relies on smallholder production with reduced farm management in a forested landscape. Finally, we emphasize that seed dispersers and insectivores should be the priority conservation targets in cacao systems.

TI  - Ethnobotany of the Kombong Agroforestry System and Tongkonan Conservation in the Toraja Tribe, South Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kombong agroforestry system (KAS) has long been practiced and plays an important role in the livelihoods of the Toraja trib & eacute;s settlements, in addition to their social, cultural, and environmental sustainability. This research aims to explain the species composition and wood volume, how the utilization of plant species in the KAS has social, cultural, economic, and ecological functions, analyze the plant cultural significance of KAS of the Toraja tribe, the role of KAS for the conservation of Tongkonan Traditional Houses (TTHs) and KAS in preserving the Rambu Tuka' and Rambu Solo' traditional ceremonies of Toraja tribe. The research used vegetation survey methods and indepth interviews with respondents, which were conducted using a set of guidelines for questionnaires. The research results indicate that there 115 plant species belonging to 49 families. The plant use category high, with foodstuffs and fruit being the use category with the highest number of species. The index of cultural significance (ICS) of the Toraja tribe varies greatly, from very high categories to those whose use is not known. Rice has the highest ICS value, with a score of 130. The KAS and TTHs are closely related and are always found in traditional Toraja settlements. They form a unit that supports each other, and the existence and sustainability of a TTH largely depend on the preservation the KAS. The KAS has a close connection to both the Rambu Solo ' and Rambu Tuka' traditional ceremonies. All plant species needed to build and maintain a TTH and for conducting these two traditional ceremonies found in the KAS. Thus, the KAS is very important for the Toraja tribe because it not only supports the economic and social aspects of their lives but also functions to protect the environment and traditional culture, including preserving the TTH form and the Rambu Solo' and Rambu Tuka' traditional parties.

TI  - Bioprospecting as a strategy for conservation and sustainable use of the Brazilian Flora
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - In Brazil, research with natural products had a strong impulse when FAPESP supported the creation of the Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Products of the Institute of Chemistry of USP (1966). In 1999, FAPESP launched the Research Program in the Characterization, Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity (BIOTA-FAPESP), which intensified the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity, and which evolved to form the Biota Network for Bioprospection and Bioassays (BIOprospecTA), which integrates groups from all over the country, optimizing the use of the skills already installed for the bioprospecting of microorganisms, plants, invertebrates, vertebrates and marine organisms. Of the 104 projects related to plant sciences, 35 carried out bioprospection of Brazilian flora, belonging to the areas of Chemistry, Botany, Genetics, Plant Physiology, Plant Morphology, Plant (Chemo)taxonomy, Ecosystem Ecology, Plant Genetics. Physical Sciences, Forest Resources, Forestry Engineering, Agronomy, leading to thousands of publications, engagement of hundreds of students and a deeper understanding of natural products in different biological models through macromolecules analysis aided by computational and spectrometric strategies, in addition to pharmacological evaluations. The development of omics approaches led to a more comprehensive view of the chemical profile of an organism, and enabled integrated and concomitant studies of several samples, and faster annotation of known molecules, through the use of hyphenated and chemometric techniques, and molecular networking. This also helped to overcome the lack of information on the safety and efficacy of herbal preparations, in projects dealing with the standardization of herbal products, according to international standards. The BIOTA-FAPESP program has also focused on environmental aspects, in accordance with the principles of Green Chemistry and has had positive effects on international collaboration, on the number and impact of scientific publications and on partnership with companies, a crucial step to add value and expand the production chain of bioproducts. Also, the compilation, systematization and sharing of data were contemplated with the creation of the NUBBEDB database, of free access, and that integrates with international databases (ACD/labs, American Chemical Society - ACS), helping researchers and companies in the development from different areas of science, technology, strengthening the bioeconomy and subsidizing public policies.

TI  - Seed-Bird co-occurrence networks in cocoa agroforests: Morphological matching analysis reveals shading effects on network organization.
T2  - Journal for Nature Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are highly vulnerable to ongoing deforestation, which often involves converting land for agricultural use. While tropical agroforests have been promoted as wildlife-friendly systems, limited information is available on the ability of agroforests to provide diverse fruits that attract birds and thus contribute to essential ecological processes, such as seed dispersal. Here, we evaluated the organization of tropical seed-bird cooccurrence networks in cocoa agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Specifically, we investigated the influence of (i) landscape and local predictors in shaping the structure of seed-bird co-occurrence networks; and (ii) species traits in explaining their interactive role in the networks. We constructed matrices of presence-absence interactions based on morphological matching among the beak width of frugivorous bird species and the size of ornithochorous seed species (both native and exotic species), using field data of seed rain and understory bird surveys from 15 cocoa agroforests. We further evaluated both the effects of landscape forest cover and local shading on five network indices and how functional traits of birds and seeds explain their importance to the network. In total, we obtained 467 events of potential plant-bird interactions, which revealed a modular pattern. We also observed that only canopy shading significantly affected network connectance, and seed diameter was a significant predictor in explaining tree species contribution in the network. Therefore, our findings show that cocoa agroforests with greater shading will have greater opportunities for interactions between frugivorous birds and plants. We also observed that plants with small seeds play a more relevant role in the co-occurrence interaction network. Based on findings, we emphasized that cocoa agroforests likely maintain certain mutualistic relationships to ensure ecosystem functionality and demonstrate that co-occurrence networks have great potential for future seed dispersal networks in agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Arbuscular and ectomycorrizal fungi in eucalypt cultivation and grassland sandy soil
T2  - Ciencia Florestal
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden forms symbiotic association with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi. The porpoise of this work was to evaluate the direct and the indirect population and the diversity of these organisms in this kind forest of in some sandy areas located in the Sao Francisco de Assis - RS. Soil and roots samples were collected from native field and Eucaliptus cultivation to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal fungi were also collected from these areas. The studied areas were characterized as native field and eucalyptus forest with three and eight years old. Results show that the indirect identification (trapping culture) with Brachiaria brizantha (A. Rich.) Stapf is efficient in the recovery endomycorrhizal inoculum fungi from the soil. The Glomus, Gigaspora, Acaulospora and Scutellospora were the most important genus found. The Acaulospora scrobiculata and Scutellospora heterogama were the predominant species. The ectomycorrhizal fungi found were Pisolithus sp. Alb. & Schewein; Scleroderma sp. (Persoon) Fries and Pisolithus microcarpus (Cooke & Massee) Cumm. The relative abundance was predominant with Scleroderma sp. The native field showed higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi population and diversity in relation to other eucaliptus areas.

TI  - Dolichopodidae abundance in different cover crop species
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the Dolichopodidae abundance in different cover crop species. For this, the following species were used in treatments: Crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), castor bean (Ricinus communis) and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum). The survey was carried out in a field during two seasons 2012/2013 (November/December to March) and 2013/2014 (October/November to February). The Dolichopodidae abundance were evaluated weekly using a sweep net and Moericke traps. In addition, the phytophagous abundance (Thysanoptera: Thripidae; Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae and Hemiptera: Aphididae) was quantified, to allow for an inference about density-dependence. In total, 13,987 long-legged flies (96.5% in Moericke traps) were captured, represented only by the species Condylostylus erectus Becker, 1922 (Diptera: Dolichopodidae). In general, the higher abundance of C. erectus was observed in buckwheat and cowpea. Regarding the phytophagous species, 48,371 individuals [Thripidae (77.5%), Aleyrodidae (20.2%), and Aphididae (2.5%)] were quantified and a clear correlation with the C. erectus population was not evidenced. Thus, these results suggested that buckwheat and cowpea make resources available to long-legged flies, as discussed in our research. Finally, the buckwheat and cowpea sowing are options to increase the abundance of C. erectus predator populations in agroecosystems.

TI  - Climate friendliness of cocoa agroforests is compatible with productivity increase
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing demand for agricultural commodities that are produced in a climate-friendly manner. At the same time, in many or most tropical countries there is need for intensification of agricultural production to increase yields and incomes, and this usually requires higher external inputs that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions. Here we investigate if production methods that have a beneficial effect on the climate (are climate-friendly) are compatible with increased inputs and yields for traditional, shaded cocoa (Theobroma cacao) production systems (locally known as cabrucas) in southern Bahia, Brazil. We use two easily measurable and manageable dimensions of climate friendliness, namely the carbon (C) stocks in the large trees and the C footprint as related to on-farm agrochemical and fuel use. Through interviews and field inventories in 26 cabruca farms representing a range of production practices and intensities, we identify the combinations of management practices, yields, C stocks and C footprints typically found in the region. We find that yield levels up to the highest encountered yield of 585 kg ha(-1), or twice the current regional average of 285 kg ha(-1), are compatible with an aboveground C stock in the large shade trees (> 30 cm diameter at breast height) of up to 65 Mg ha(-1) and up to 55 % shade. Higher C stocks and shade levels are generally associated with yields below the regional average. Input-related C emissions increased non-linearly with increasing yield, but even the highest encountered yields were compatible with low (< 0.25 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) to medium (< 0.5 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) input-related emission levels. Cocoa yields responded positively to increased fertilizer applications, provided that other factors, including shade levels, were not limiting. Consequently, the highest input-related emissions (> 1 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) of cocoa) were related to large fertilizer applications that did not proportionately increase yields. We conclude that doubling the cocoa output from southern Bahia, where cabrucas are the predominant form of growing cocoa, is compatible with climate-friendly production practices, measured by local standards. We suggest that the presented methodology can be used to identify opportunities for climate-friendly intensification of tree crops more generally, thereby increasing the contribution of commodity production to global climate change mitigation.

TI  - Morphometric Changes in Three Species of Euglossini (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Response to Landscape Structure
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and expansion of agricultural activities are anthropic factors that can strongly impact biodiversity. Thus, sustainable practices of land use, such as agroforestry systems, are adopted with the proposal of improving environmental quality and restore ecological processes. In flying insects, habitat fragmentation may cause changes in the wing shape and size. Therefore, we hypothesized that landscape structure would affect wing size and shape in three species of Euglossini (Eulaema atleticana Nemesio, Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus) and Euglossa ignita Smith). The analysed specimens were collected in five areas, four forest areas with strong anthropic influence and an agroforestry system area. The results of the wing shape analysis have showed that the individuals of the three collected species within the agroforestry system diverge significantly (p<0.05) from those collected in the other areas. On the wings of Eg. cordata and Eg. ignita, differences in shape have occurred mainly in the medial region, which actively participates in the individual's flying ability. The wing size has showed meaningful difference only to the population of Eg. ignita (p=0,005). For Eg. cordata and El. atleticana, there was a significant correlation (r<0.05) between the morphometric data and the landscape metrics, which shows a close relationship between these species and the forest cover. The wing shape and size pursue an important function for the individual's ability in the environment, such as dispersion capacity and fertility rate, respectively. We concluded that the morphometric differences can reveal the existence of environmental stress for Euglossine bees. Therefore, the results contribute to establish morphometry variability as a tool for environmental quality monitoring.

TI  - Crop functional diversity drives multiple ecosystem functions during early agroforestry succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We still lack practical guidelines for diversifying cropping systems that consider both yield and regulating functions of agroecosystems. Recent studies have suggested that maximizing functional diversity (FD, the distribution of species with different functional traits in the niche space) may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality due to niche complementarity. Therefore, scientists are now advocating the use of a trait-based approach to develop multifunctional sustainable agroecosystems.In order to assess the effects of crop FD on key agroecosystem functions and to consider trade-offs and synergies among them, we established, in late 2016, permanent experimental field plots of successional agroforestry systems (SAFS), in humid subtropical Southern Brazil. The experiment represents a gradient of plant functional trait diversity (designed FD based on leaf nitrogen concentration), while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. Our hypothesis is that the observed FD of crops (hereafter, crop FD) drives multiple agroecosystem functions.We determined the observed FD by quantifying traits of crops and weeds (maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area) and performed two data collections (March and September 2017) at the end of the summer and winter crops respectively. We used structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical causal model to explain how crop FD affects three functions: weed suppression, soil protection (soil cover by either crops or weeds) and crop yield.Our results support the hypothesis that high crop FD drives agroecosystem processes and contributes to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions. We found that with greater crop FD in SAFS, crop plants occupied a large niche space, thereby increasing the total photosynthetic light intercepted in the agroecosystem, that in turn, increased crop yield. Additionally, greater FD increased soil protection by crops and decreased weed cover. This greater FD also reduced the FD of the weed community.Synthesis and applications. Crop mixtures based on complementary plant traits can increase the multifunctionality of agroecosystems through their sustainable use. A more heterogeneous structure and projection of crop leaf area drives greater resistance to competition with weeds and produces higher crop yields in young diversified crop mixtures.

TI  - A minor pest reduces yield losses by a major pest: plant-mediated herbivore interactions in Indonesian cacao
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Herbivores inducing host-plant trait changes can indirectly affect the performance, distribution, abundance and behaviour of other herbivores, even when they are temporally or spatially separated. However, it is unclear whether this occurs at scales relevant for applied purposes such as pest control in agricultural crops.2. We studied the indirect effects of a minor pest, the mirid bug Helopeltis sulawesi, on the major pest of cacao Theobroma cacao in Southeast Asia, the pod-boring moth Conopomorpha cramerella. For 2 years, we surveyed herbivore damage and yield in 10 focal trees in each of the 43 cacao plantations and analysed patterns of co-occurrence of the two herbivores. In a two-choice experiment, we tested whether gravid females of C. cramerella searching for oviposition sites discriminate against pods damaged by H. sulawesi.3. The proportion of pods affected by both pest species was significantly lower than expected. This pattern could not be ascribed to differential responses to environmental or management variables, but was because of avoidance of H. sulawesi damage by ovipositing C. cramerella females as shown in a two-choice experiment. The reduction in co-occurrence of damage by the two herbivores was found at tree and at plot scale and held across three harvest seasons.4. The differential yield impacts by the two herbivores and the avoidance by C. cramerella of pods damaged by H. sulawesi lead to a yield optimumat a H. sulawesi incidence of 51%.5. Synthesis and application. Plant-mediated indirect interactions between minor and major pest insects can be important drivers of yield loss at agriculturally relevant spatial and temporal scales. In cacao, the mirid bug H. sulawesi, a minor pest, generates conspicuous damage which often triggers pest control with insecticides. This practice may be counterproductive, because decreasing H. sulawesi damage benefits the main pest, the cacao pod borer C. cramerella resulting in a marketable yield optimum at intermediate densities of the minor pest. Pest control recommendations should take into account the relative effect of control measures on interacting herbivores to avoid replacing one pest problem with another, potentially more serious one, during the course of a fruiting season.

TI  - Urea fertilization can reduce soil bacterial and archaeal diversity in agroforestry systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems can be beneficial to soil microbial diversity, however, it might be affected by inorganic fertilizer use. This study evaluated the effects of urea (0, 100, 200, and 400 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) on soil bacterial and archaeal diversity in an agroforestry system in the Amazon region (Brazil). The system was composed of grass, native palms, and N-fixing legume trees. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four treatments and three replications, each experimental unit had 0.25 ha(-1). Bacterial and archaeal diversity were investigated by next-generation sequencing (MiSeq sequencing platform). Bacterial quantities were assessed by colony-forming units; and 16 rRNA gene copy numbers (GCN) via Real-time PCR. Soil colony-forming units (CFU) did not differ across the levels of N inputs (p = 0.458) ranging 10(5)-10(6) CFU per g(-1) soil, bacterial 16 rRNA GCN was lower at 400 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) compared to the control without urea application (p < 0.05); 16 rRNA GCN ranged at 10(9) g(-1) soil. The highest urea level (400 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) reduced bacterial and archaeal diversity and increased ammonia-oxidizing archaea over methanogens. Nitrososphaera was a predominant archaeal genus (47%) in this agroforestry soil. Bacillus was the most abundant bacterial genus (18%) regardless of urea application. The bacterial community was less affected by the inputs of N than the archaea. The findings of this study suggest that the expected benefits of adopting agroforestry systems on soil microbial diversity can be reduced or neutralized by excessive and long-term N inputs using urea.

TI  - Mycobiota of revegetated post-mining and adjacent unmined sites 10 years after mining decommissioning
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although overlooked in post-mining rehabilitation, soil mycobiota constitute an important fraction of biodiversity, playing pivotal functions in soil that contribute to the revegetation process and soil stability in post-mining environments. Evaluating the rehabilitation progress requires comparing it, when possible, with a reference site, preferably identical or similar to pre-mining characteristics. Here, we investigated the mycobiota from a reference site, comparable to pre-mining characteristics, and a post-mining revegetated site 10 years after decommissioning and revegetation, during rainy and dry seasons. We combined the metabarcoding approach with functional traits from fungal operational taxonomic units and complemented our results with traditional techniques for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) surveys using spore morphology and mycorrhizal colonization. Our findings demonstrated that the composition of the fungal community exhibited more differences between the two sites studied than the intra-annual periods assessed, even though the sites were under the same climatic conditions, spatially nearby, and without barriers between them. The mycobiota composition displayed differences between sites from phylum to genus levels. However, the predictive trophic modes (pathotrophs, saprotrophs, and symbionts) were equivalent in the two sites. All roots of plants assessed had AMF colonization, and AMF spore densities were similar. While many fungal taxa were present at both sites, the spatial connectivity between both sites was insufficient for equivalence of fungal community structure and composition. Differences in chemical and physical soil characteristics may have shaped the fungal communities. This study highlights the need to comprehend the fungal community from mining environments, considering concepts of landscape connectivity.

TI  - Food habits of Hylaeamys seuanezi (Weksler, Geise & Cerqueira, 1999) (Rodentia: Cricetidae) in forest formations: a comparison of methods and habitats
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Food habits are traces of a species' natural history that help us to understand how the organisms interact with the environment. Hylaeamys seuanezi is a forest-specialist rodent also recorded in diverse shaded cocoa agroforestry systems. Here we describe and classify its diet, comparing the results acquired from stomach and fecal contents, collected in forest and cocoa agroforest sites. We analyzed 203 samples from 126 individuals: 51 captured in agroforest and 75 in forest. We measured the relative contribution of vegetable and animal matter and the relative frequency of 17 food items. Our results indicate that H. seuanezi consumes a greater proportion of vegetable than animal matter, but should be considered omnivore, given the frequent consumption of arthropods. The richness and composition of items was similar between stomach and fecal samples. The richness of items also did not vary between the environments, but the composition of the items did. Intact seeds were more frequent in samples from forests and unidentified arthropods and Hymenoptera in samples from agroforest. Despite variation among consumed items, the diverse shaded cocoa agroforestry systems provide a diversity of resources, which likely favor the maintenance of H. seuanezi in these plantations and in the study region.

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Differentiation in Plathymenia reticulata Benth.: A Comparative Study of Forest and Cocoa Agroforest Systems in the Atlantic Forest Domain
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests, housing about two-thirds of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, face significant deforestation and fragmentation, leading to the loss of over half their area. Conservation and restoration efforts are crucial, especially for regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which suffers with a reduction in biomass and species diversity. The Brazilian agroforest system, typical from the region of Southern Bahia called "cabruca", are helping to mitigate these effects by combining cocoa cultivation with forest management, enhancing both socio-economic and environmental benefits. In a study focusing on Plathymenia reticulata, a tree species native to the Atlantic Forest, we evaluated the effectiveness of the cabruca agroforest system versus the natural forest for maintaining genetic diversity and landscape connectivity. Results showed that cabruca systems, while managed, exhibit a level of genetic diversity compared to natural forests. However, forest populations remain critical for their genetic reservoirs and adaptability. The cabrucas agroforest system also showed higher inbreeding levels, emphasizing the need for effective management to reduce inbreeding risks.

TI  - Negotiation support models for integrated natural resource management in tropical forest margins
T2  - CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural resource management research has to evolve from a focus on plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, with a large number of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural resource management problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in local environmental services, but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management, Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people?

AB  - Social welfare and food security become essential issues of forest management in Java. Agroforestry development have a potential to tackle these both issues without sacrifing the forest sustainability. The best agroforestry system should integrate the following three aspects: production, ecological, and social sustainabilities. This study aimed to identify the best agroforestry system that are established in plantation forest area, in Banyumas Forest Management Unit. Four different agroforestry systems were evaluated i.e. Teak, Pine, Cajuput, and Clonal Teak patterns. Each agroforestry system has different intercropping area based on their initial spacing of woody plant. The analytical hierarchy process method and followed by multi criteria analysis were used to determine the best agroforestry system. The proposed indicators of production aspect were timber forest product and non timber forest product. Meanwhile, the defined parameters of ecological aspect were plant biodiversity, microclimate, as well as soil and water conservation. The indicators of social aspect were market network, adoptability, and manageability. The result indicated that the weight for production, ecological, and social sustainabilities aspects were 0.43; 0.14; 0.43, respectively. This study revealed the best agroforestry system that can integrate the balance of production, ecological, and social sustainabilities aspects was Clonal Teak pattern (2.39). The next position was occupied by Teak pattern (2.08) and then followed by Pine pattern (2.06). The Cajuput pattern, however, was the last position (1.15), and therefore it was not recommended for agroforestry system in this area.

TI  - Proximate composition of Xylocarpus moluccensis seeds and their oils
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in protecting shorelines, supporting the food web, and sequestering carbon. In addition, they offer protection against waves, winds, storms, and tsunamis. Indonesian mangrove resources are increasingly being lost due to unsustainable utilization and habitat conversion. Reclamation for aquaculture and agriculture is currently considered the main way to achieve the development of mangrove areas. However, these types of reclamation are costly and have adverse environmental effects. The isolation, identification, and utilization of valuable mangrove products, such as Xylocarpus moluccensis, are other ways to achieve the development of mangrove areas. X. moluccensis is a species of mangrove that has medicinal properties. However, its nutritive and lipids values have not been evaluated. In this study, the proximate composition and mineral content of X. moluccensis seeds, as well as the fatty acid composition of X. moluccensis seed oils, were investigated. The results revealed that X. moluccensis fruit seeds contained crude lipids (10.65-11.09%), crude proteins (4.76-10.14%), ash (10.07-11.59%), crude fibers (7.81-15.85%), and nitrogen free extract (e.g. carbohydrates (52.42-63.32%)). The seeds also contained copper (12.82 ppm), iron (20.25 ppm), manganese (16.22 ppm), zinc (5.89 ppm), potassium (621.98 ppm), and calcium (43.69 ppm). Myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidic acid (C20:0), and docosanoic acid (C22:0) were identified in the hexane extracts of X. moluccensis fruit seeds. It was found that mangrove seeds of moluccensis have potential as biodiesel feedstock due to their lipid content. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of eucalyptus development under soil fauna
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the implantation of forests, soil tillage can affect the soil fauna, but over the years, it is possible that forest development can recompose the biological indicators of soil quality. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different periods of eucalyptus development on community of edaphic fauna. The experiment was carried out in forest areas in the municipality of Ametista do Sul, RS. The Experimental design was completely randomized with 6 treatments, once 4 of the treatments were with different ages of the Eucalyptus grandis (two, four, six and eight years after trasnplant - YAT); plus 2 control treatments: Native Forest and Soil Naked, with 7 collection points. To sample the edaphic fauna, it was used traps such as PROVID. Also, the edaphic fauna was sampled at the depth of 0-5 cm for the quantification of mites. It was carried out the counting of individuals at the level of order and family for the mites, the means of the groups were submitted to the Tukey test and comparisons by Orthogonal Contrasts and calculated indices of Biodiversity: Margalef Richness, Simpson dominance, Shannon diversity and Pielou uniformity. The results showed lower abundance of individuals in Naked soil, while the Native Forest presented the best Biodiversity indices. With eight years of implantation of eucalyptus there was recovered the biological quality of the soil expressed by the population of springtails. The population of oribatideos mites increased expressively from the six years of implantation of eucalyptus.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to estimate the abundance, diversity and constancy of families from the order Hymenoptera, such as the seasonality of those through a survey on the insect population in a silvopastoral system. We installed a Malaise-type trap in a area managed by a silvopastoral system in Coronel Pacheco, MG, from August 2006 to July 2008. The trapped insects were screened, and those of the order Hymenoptera were classified into their respective family categories and quantified. We adopted the methodology of Bodenheimer to calculate the indices of constancy, while other indices were estimated PAST program. We sampled 5841 specimens in total, which included 549 morphospecies and were distributed among 11 families. Of the total specimens sampled, 80% were Formicidae, which besides being the most abundant, was also the most diverse and constant family. When entomophagous insects were analyzed, the highest values for these indices were recorded for the families Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, and Vespidae. Pollinators were less prevalent compared to the total number of sampled individuals. The population density in the Hymenoptera was not correlated between the two sampling years and climate factors.

TI  - Impact of Lowland Rainforest Transformation on Diversity and Composition of Soil Prokaryotic Communities in Sumatra (Indonesia)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prokaryotes are the most abundant and diverse group of microorganisms in soil and mediate virtually all biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Thereby, they influence aboveground plant productivity and diversity. In this study, the impact of rainforest transformation to intensively managed cash crop systems on soil prokaryotic communities was investigated. The studied managed land use systems comprised rubber agroforests (jungle rubber), rubber plantations and oil palm plantations within two Indonesian landscapes Bukit Duabelas and Harapan. Soil prokaryotic community composition and diversity were assessed by pyrotag sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. The curated dataset contained 16,413 bacterial and 1679 archaeal operational taxonomic units at species level (97% genetic identity). Analysis revealed changes in indigenous taxon-specific patterns of soil prokaryotic communities accompanying lowland rainforest transformation to jungle rubber, and intensively managed rubber and oil palm plantations. Distinct clustering of the rainforest soil communities indicated that these are different from the communities in the studied managed land use systems. The predominant bacterial taxa in all investigated soils were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Overall, the bacterial community shifted from proteobacterial groups in rainforest soils to Acidobacteria in managed soils. The archaeal soil communities were mainly represented by Thaurnarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Members of the Terrestrial Group and South African Gold Mine Group 1 (Thaumarchaeota) dominated in the rainforest and members of Thermoplasmata in the managed land use systems. The alpha and beta diversity of the soil prokaryotic communities was higher in managed land use systems than in rainforest. In the case of bacteria, this was related to soil characteristics such as pH value, exchangeable Ca and Fe content, C to N ratio, and extractable P content. Archaeal community composition and diversity were correlated to pH value, exchangeable Fe content, water content, and total N. The distribution of bacterial and archaeal taxa involved in biological N cycle indicated functional shifts of the cycle during conversion of rainforest to plantations.

TI  - Effect of selective logging on genetic diversity and gene flow in Cariniana legalis sampled from a cacao agroforestry system
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The fragments of the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia have a long history of intense logging and selective cutting. Some tree species, such as jequitiba rosa (Cariniana legalis), have experienced a reduction in their populations with respect to both area and density. To evaluate the possible effects of selective logging on genetic diversity, gene flow, and spatial genetic structure, 51 C. legalis individuals were sampled, representing the total remaining population from the cacao agroforestry system. A total of 120 alleles were observed from the 11 microsatellite loci analyzed. The average observed heterozygosity (0.486) was less than the expected heterozygosity (0.721), indicating a loss of genetic diversity in this population. A high fixation index (F-IS = 0.325) was found, which is possibly due to a reduction in population size, resulting in increased mating among relatives. The maximum (1055 m) and minimum (0.095 m) distances traveled by pollen or seeds were inferred based on paternity tests. We found 36.84% of unique parents among all sampled seedlings. The progenitors of the remaining seedlings (63.16%) were most likely out of the sampled area. Positive and significant spatial genetic structure was identified in this population among classes 10 to 30 m away with an average coancestry coefficient between pairs of individuals of 0.12. These results suggest that the agroforestry system of cacao cultivation is contributing to maintaining levels of diversity and gene flow in the studied population, thus minimizing the effects of selective logging.

TI  - Landscape contexts shape the effects of local factors on the predation of artificial bird nests in cocoa agroforests.
T2  - Landscape Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextNest predation represents the pivotal threat to bird reproduction in disturbed environments. Although some agricultural systems, such as agroforests, are considered biodiversity-friendly, there is still a lack of information on how factors acting at different spatial scales shape nest predation in these environments.ObjectivesWe assessed the effects of landscape (native forest cover and total forest cover) and local factors (number of shade trees, cocoa trees, understory plants, and canopy openness) on the number of predated bird nests in cocoa agroforests.MethodsArtificial nests were placed on the ground and in the understory of 30 agroforests located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The agroforests were embedded in three regions with different amounts of native forest remnants and areas designated for cocoa agroforests and cattle pastures. Using GLMM models and the Akaike information criterion, we identified which environmental predictors can determine nest predation in agroforests.ResultsWe detected that ground nests are more vulnerable to predation than understory nests. We also observed higher nest predation in the region dominated by cocoa agroforestry systems than in the region with high forest cover. Our statistical models evidenced an increase in the number of predated nests in agroforests presenting a high number of understory plants and cocoa trees, particularly when located in deforested landscapes.ConclusionsOur study highlighted that the landscape context in which the cocoa agroforests are situated can modulate the effect of local characteristics on the predation of artificial nests.

AB  - In tropical rain forests, interactions among a large diversity of organisms determine to a large extent such ecosystem attributes as high primary production, efficient cycling of water and nutrients and resilience. Management practices implemented in these areas involve different degrees of transformation from the simple gathering of forest products to the replacement of forest by annual monocrops. Induced desequilibrium in ecosystem processes has often resulted in severe dysfunctions and dramatic economic failures. The association of tree and herbaceous species in diverse plant associations aims to meet the need for economical development while maintaining the functional integrity of the ecosystem.

TI  - Ants' higher taxa as surrogates of species richness in a chronosequence of fallows, old-grown forests and agroforestry systems in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation in Amazon forests is one of the main causes for biodiversity loss worldwide. Ants are key into the ecosystem because act like engineers; hence, the loss of ants' biodiversity may be a guide to measure the loss of essential functions into the ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil ant's richness and to estimate whether higher taxa levels (Subfamily and Genus) can be used as surrogates of species richness in different vegetation types (fallows, old -growth forests and agroforestry systems) in Eastern Amazon. The samples were taken in 65 areas in the Maranhao and Para States in the period 2011-2014. The sampling scheme followed the procedure of Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF). Initially, the vegetation types were characterized according to their age and estimated species richness. Linear and exponential functions were applied to evaluate if higher taxa can be used as surrogates and correlated with the Pearson coefficient. In total, 180 species distributed in 60 genera were identified. The results showed that ant species richness was higher in intermediate fallows (88) and old secondary forest (76), and was lower in agroforestry systems (38) and mature riparian forest (35). The genus level was the best surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness across the different vegetation types, and explained 72-97 % (P < 0.001) of the total species variability. The results confirmed that the genus level is an excellent surrogate to estimate the ant's species richness in the region and that both fallows and agroforestry systems may contribute in the conservation of Eastem Amazon ant community.

T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the remnant tree flora in six forest fragments in the metropolitan area of Belem and to analyze these fragments in terms of biological conservation, species richness and diversity in the local urban landscape. The fragments and their respective sampling areas were as follows: Amafrutas reserve (15 ha), Trambioca Is. reserve (2 ha), Bosque Rodrigues Alves city park (15 ha), Combu Is. reserve (10 ha), Gunma Park reserve (10 ha) and Mocambo reserve (5 ha). Inventories were built from lineal plots of 250 m(2) and included trees with DBH equal to or greater than 10 cm at a height of 1.3 m above ground. Sixty-nine families and 759 species, of which eight were officially listed as endangered (Brazilian National Flora: Ministry of Environment, Normative Instruction of September, 2008; Para State Flora: Decree N-o. 802 of February 2008) were recorded. These endangered species are: Aspidosperma desmanthum Benth. ex Mull. Arg. (Apocynaceae), Cedrela odorata L. (Meliaceae), Eschweilera piresii S. A Mori (Lecythidaceae), Euxylophora paraensis Huber (Rutaceae), Hymenolobium excelsum Ducke (Leguminosae), Manilkara huberi (Ducke) Chevalier (Sapotaceae), Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart. ex DC.) Standl. (Bignoniaceae), Mezilaurus itauba (Meisn.) Taub. ex Mez (Lauraceae) and Qualea coerulea Aubl. (Vochysiaceae). Emergency actions such as implementing management plans for already existing Conservation Units, the creation of new such units in areas of primary forest fragments (as in the case of the Amafrutas reserve), as well as the intensification of actions of surveillance and monitoring, should be undertaken by Federal, State, and Municipal environmental agencies so as to ensure the conservation of these last primary forest remnants in the metropolitan area of Belem.

CP  - Global Workshop on Bringing the Landscape into Focus
CL  - Chiang Mai, THAILAND
AB  - Species richness of terrestrial ferns and fern allies (Pteridophyta) may indicate forest habitat quality, as analysed here for a tropical lowland area in Sumatra. A total of 51 standard 0.16 ha plots in primary forest, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests and rubber plantations was compared for plot level diversity (average number of species per plot) and landscape level diversity (species-area curves). Average plot level species richness (I I species) was not significantly different amongst the three land use types. However at the landscape level the species-area curve for rubber agroforests (also called jungle rubber) had a significantly higher slope parameter than the curve for rubber plantations, indicating higher beta diversity in jungle rubber as compared to rubber plantations. Plot level species richness is thus not fully indicative of the (relative) richness of a land use type at the landscape scale because scaling relations differ between land use types. Terrestrial fern species can serve as indicators of disturbance or forest quality as many species show clear habitat differentiation with regard to light conditions and/or humidity. To assess forest habitat quality in rubber production systems as compared to primary forest, terrestrial pteridophyte species were grouped according to their ecological requirements into 'forest species' and 'non-forest species'. Species-area curves based on 'forest species' alone show that the understorey environment of jungle rubber supports intermediate numbers of 'forest species' and is much more forest-like than that of rubber plantations, but less than primary forest. Species richness alone, without a priori ecological knowledge of the species involved, did not provide this information. Jungle rubber systems can play a role in conservation of part of the primary rain forest species, especially in areas where the primary forest has already disappeared. In places where primary forest is gone, jungle rubber can conserve part of the primary forest species, but large areas of jungle rubber are needed. In places where primary forest is still present, priority should be given to conservation of remaining primary forest patches. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many agroforestry systems are found in places that otherwise would be appropriate for natural forests, and often have replaced them. Humans have had a profound influence on forests virtually everywhere they both are found. Thus 'natural' defined as 'without human influence' is a hypothetical construct, though one that has assumed mythological value among many conservationists. Biodiversity is a forest value that does not carry a market price. It is the foundation, however, upon which productive systems depend. The relationship between agroforestry and the wild biodiversity contained in more natural forests is a complicated one, depending on the composition of the agroforestry system itself and the way it is managed. Complex forest gardens are more supportive of biodiversity than monocrop systems, shade coffee more than sun coffee, and systems using native plants tend to be more biologically diverse. Nonnative plants, especially potentially invasive alien species, threaten biodiversity and need to be avoided. The relationship between forests, agroforestry and wild biodiversity can be made most productive through applying adaptive management approaches that incorporate ongoing research and monitoring in order to feed information back into the management system. Maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems will provide humanity with the widest range of options for adapting to changing conditions. Clear government policy frameworks are needed that support alliances among the many interest groups involved in forest biodiversity.

TI  - Is shadier better? The effect of agroforestry management on small mammal diversity
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems play fundamental roles for wildlife conservation, but are prone to disturbances from management practices aiming at increasing local productivity. This work investigates the small mammal assemblages present in cacao agroforests, which differ in shade tree density. We tested the prediction that higher tree density increases shade level, analyzed how some environmental variables important for small mammals (vegetation complexity, tree basal area, and invertebrate biomass) vary across the shade level gradient, and how the assemblages respond to these variations. We also tested the effect of the environmental variables on the abundance of the three most common species: Rhipidomys mastacalis, Hylaeamys seuanezi, and Marmosa murina. We captured 651 individuals belonging to 18 species. A positive relationship was observed between an abundance of non-forest specialists and tree basal area, while species diversity within this group showed positive association with vegetation complexity. Assemblage structure (described by a matrix of species abundance per site) was not affected by our environmental variables, but R. mastacalis was more abundant in sites with lower vegetation complexity. Higher shade levels in cacao agroforest tended to occur in sites with greater tree basal area, which was not a good predictor of small mammal diversity. This suggests that environmental management to reduce shade with the purpose of increasing cacao productivity is not necessarily negative for small mammal conservation. Species diversity was favored by structurally complex systems, a possible response to greater niche diversity.in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Landscape composition is more important than local vegetation structure for understory birds in cocoa agroforestry systems
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity-friendly agricultural systems allow the maintenance of native species even in highly fragmented landscapes by providing corridors to species dispersion and offering supplementary resources for animal populations. In the tropical region, cocoa agroforestry systems are of great importance for biodiversity conservation as they maintain part of the native vegetation, and therefore can be used by the local fauna. In this system, understory of native forests is replaced by cocoa trees, which are shaded by large old-growth trees. However, the persistence of native species in cocoa agroforests depends on local vegetation characteristics but also the landscape structure in which these systems are located. Here, we investigated the influence of landscape composition (i.e. amount of forest cover, cocoa agroforestry and cattle pasture) and local vegetation structure (i.e. number of native and cocoa trees, basal area of native trees and canopy closure) on understory birds in 18 cocoa agroforestry systems located in three regions in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, presenting distinct land use contexts. Specifically, we assessed the effects of these landscape and local features in predicting richness and abundance patterns of the entire community, and also in distinct ecological groups, such as forest-dependent and non-forestdependent birds, and insectivores, frugivores, and omnivores. Using generalized linear models and Akaike information criterion, we observed lower species richness of complete community, non-forest and omnivorous birds in the most deforested region. Also, our findings demonstrated that cocoa agroforests integrated in more forested landscapes harbor greater richness and abundance of frugivorous birds. Conversely, the increase in cattle pasture amount at the landscape had a harsh effect on all bird groups evaluated. Regarding local vegetation, we observed that the increase of canopy closure leads to greater abundance of insectivorous birds in cocoa agmforestry systems. Similarly, abundance of non-forest species increased in agroforests with higher number of cocoa trees. Our study demonstrated that cocoa agroforestry systems can provide complementary habitats for many species, including forest birds, and therefore can mitigate the effects of habitat loss. However, this key benefit for bird conservation will be more effective when these agmforestry systems are located in more forested landscapes, with low amount of cattle pastures. Our findings therefore reinforce the alarming need to maintain and recover landscape-scale forest amount to ensure species persistence of birds in anthmpogenic landscapes, even in those comprising biodiversity-friendly land uses such as cocoa agmforestry systems.

TI  - Spatial dynamic and spillover of the polyphagous pest Bemisia tabaci is influenced by differences in farmland habitats on tropical organic farms
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interplay between natural, non-cropped, and cropped habitats affects insect movement in the landscape. Polyphagous, highly mobile pests are more likely to cross habitat-edges and colonize crops. However, local differences within habitats can affect pest populations and modulate their broad response to the landscape. We investigated how different habitat types influence the spatiotemporal dynamics and spillover of a polyphagous pest on tropical organic vegetable farms. We simultaneously sampled the abundance of the worldwide pest Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) on crops, fallow areas, agroforests, and forests fragments on five farms for two years. This whitefly species achieved higher population growth rates in open-field habitats (mostly crops), where resources are more easily found and concentrated. The lack of density dependence on population growth suggests that migration drives habitat occupancy. Crops were the main source of individuals to other habitat types, while agroforests and forest fragments (both sink and stepping-stones habitats) are most likely temporary habitats for whiteflies where they face a populational bottleneck. Regardless of habitat features, higher precipitation and low temperatures independently regulated population densities throughout seasons. Fragmented agricultural landscapes reduced bottom-up effects of forests and facilitated whitefly infestation on crops due to edge effects. In summary, the source-sink dynamics of whiteflies was largely determined by sink habitats that differ in local characteristics and management but was also influenced by landscape type. These findings indicate that the farmland habitat scale was adequate to integrate the scale-dependent processes operating on different spatial (local and landscape) and temporal (seasonality) scales on pest populations.

TI  - Influence of land use on the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles in the semideciduous Atlantic forest of Argentina
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation and replacement of natural ecosystems affect species abundance, diversity and interspecific interaction through the modification of resource availability and environmental conditions. Land uses preserving the forest canopy show higher species richness and similarity to the native forest. In this study, we explored changes in the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles between the native forest and different land uses in the semideciduous Atlantic forest, under the hypothesis that trophic niche overlap increases with species richness. We sampled dung beetles in protected native forests and four land uses (pine plantations, agroforestry parklands, silvo-pastoral systems and open pastures), using seven potential food sources (monkey, feline, tapir and deer dung, decomposing fruit, decomposing fungi and carrion). The species richness of each habitat, the trophic niche overlap and the relation between both measures were analysed. Also, we explored species trophic preferences in each habitat to explain and discuss the results obtained in trophic niche overlap measures. As expected, our results showed a positive relation between species richness and trophic niche overlap. Moreover, the addition of different resources in open habitats did not increase species richness, suggesting that resource availability may not be the main mechanism explaining the empoverished dung beetle community observed in open habitats. Other mechanisms, such as physiological restrictions, may play a role in limiting the use of these habitats. Studies on the mechanisms leading to the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in land uses are necessary to propose management recommendations that increase the sustainability of open habitats.

TI  - Biota of subtropical Oxisols under no-tillage with application of liquid cattle manure
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Organic amendments in agricultural systems benefit the soil biota; however, their consecutive use can interfere negatively with the biota diversity and functionality. Aims This study evaluated the biomass and microbial activity and the epiedaphic fauna response of soil with consecutive liquid cattle manure (LCM) addition (4 years) in no-tillage. Methods The experiment was run in two Oxisol textures: sandy clay loam and clayey. The treatments were the control (un-manured) and three LCM doses: 60, 120 and 180 m(-3) ha(-1) year(-1), distributed in a completely randomised block design with four replications. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil microbial respiration (SMR), and microbial quotient (qMIC) were performed in the 0-5 cm layer. The epiedaphic fauna was captured by traps and abundance and ecological indices were evaluated in spring and autumn seasons. Key results In sandy clay loam soil, the MBC and SMR increased up to 180 m(-3) ha(-1) year(-1) in both spring and autumn, while in clayey soil, only the SMR increased up in the spring. The most representative groups of the epiedaphic fauna were Collembola, Acarine, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera. The Collembola population was predominant in both soils and seasons. Conclusions Consecutive annual applications of LCM in no-tillage had a greater positive impact in the soil biota in the sandy clay loam soil and in the spring season and did not negatively affect the ecological functioning of the soil biota system. Implications Application of liquid cattle manure may be beneficial for the sustainability of the agroecosystem and as a highly available and low-cost waste, it may be an alternative for replacing chemical fertilisers.

TI  - Exploring the diversity of pollinator insects in cocoa agroforestry systems: an observational approach
T2  - Journal of Entomological Research
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to identify pollinator insects species and analyze their diversity in cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) plantations. This research is descriptive exploratory with an observational approach. The sampling technique was carried out randomly purposive sampling. Sample collection was carried out twice a week for 2 months in 4 ways, namely the direct capture method, catching using insect nets, aspirator, and using the yellow sticky trap. Environmental parameters measured include environmental temperature, humidity and light intensity. The results of the research showed that 8 species of pollinator insects were found on cocoa plants which are members of 6 families and 2 orders. A total of 3 species are members of the order Diptera, namely Forcipomyia sp. (Ceratopogonidae), Cecidomyia sp. (Cecidomyiidae), and Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophilidae) and 5 species from the Order Hymenoptera viz., Crematogaster kojimai (Formicidae), and Heterotrigona itama (Apidae). The species diversity index obtained was 1.75, the species evenness index was 0.79 and the dominance index was 0.20. The findings also show that the diversity of insect pollinator species on cocoa plants at the research location is in the medium category, with a relatively even distribution of species and no dominant insect pollinator species.

TI  - Differentiating diversity among different land cover types in the eastern Amazon
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of biodiversity can be used to assess the scale of anthropogenic impact and predict species loss. A great number of diversity measures exist involving species richness and relative abundance that differ in how they are calculated. The choice of the adequate biodiversity measure to compare biological communities poses a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of 26 diversity measures to differentiate land cover types in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Diversity was inventoried and quantified in three vertical strata in six locally dominant land cover types: primary and secondary forests, agroforestry systems, oil palm plantations, annual croplands and pastures. No diversity measure was able to differentiate all land cover types in every stratum. Fisher's alpha was able to differentiate cover types in the middle and upper strata, while Smith-Wilson and Jentsch's mixture quotient were able to differentiate in the lower and upper strata, and heterogeneity indices only differentiated in the upper stratum. The distinction and ranking of plant diversity among land covers depended on the diversity measure chosen. The number and types of land cover and vertical strata were a key factor in the ability of the diversity measure to differentiate among them.

TI  - SOIL ORGANIC CARBON BUDGET UNDER CROP-LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Brazil, crop-livestock integration is increasing in areas traditionally used for extensive beef cattle production. The poor winter pasture management associated to the use of soybean monoculture in the summer may be restrictive for the incorporation of plant residues into the soil and reduce soil organic carbon stocks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the increase of winter pasture grazing frequencies and summer crop systems on the soil organic C stock. The experiment was carried out for four years under no-tillage and the experiment had a randomized block design and a 3 x 3 bifactorial arrangement with four replications. Factor A consisted of three grazing intervals in the winter: No grazing (NG), Grazing every 28 days (G28) and Grazing every 14 days (G14); and factor B consisted of three summer-cropping systems: Soybean monoculture (Mon-S), Corn monoculture (Mon-C) and annual soybean-corn rotation (Rot-SIC). The addition of C to the soil through plant residues and the soil organic C stock were quantified by the methodologies of equivalent soil layer and equivalent soil mass. The increase of the grazing frequencies reduced the C input by winter forages from 5.3 Mg ha(-1) in treatment NG, to 1.7 and 1.3 Mg ha(-1) in the treatments G28 and G14, respectively. Corn as summer crop resulted in the highest C input to the soil with a mean of 6.0 Mg ha(-1), while the soybean input was only 2.2 Mg ha(-1). The soil organic C stock calculated by the equivalent soil layer method was overestimated in the treatments G14 and G28 and underestimated in treatment NG as compared to results obtained by the soil mass equivalent method, which was used to compare the management systems. The organic C stock in the layers 0-0.025, 0.025-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m had a linear relationship with the annual C supply through plants (winter pastures + summer crops), requiring an additional 4.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) to maintain the original organic C stock in the 0-0.10 m layer. The lower C supply through plant residues in the G14 treatment resulted in an estimated net C emission to the atmosphere (0.05 to 0.27 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), while the soil in treatment NG acted as an atmospheric C sink (0. 19 to 0.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). In treatment G28, the soil performance as source or sink of atmospheric C was dependent on the summer crop type; A soil net C emission was verified under Mon-S (0.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and a net C retention under MonC (0.15 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and Rot-S/C (0.11 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The longest intervals between winter grazing associated to corn in the summer contributed to increases in biomass and soil organic C accumulation.

TI  - CONSERVATION OF THE FORESTS AT BENFICA SETTLEMENT PROJECT IN SOUTHEASTERN AMAZON
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we analyze the floristic and structure of forest remnants in Benfica Settlement Project located in the municipality of Itupiranga, in southeastern Amazon. Eleven areas of forests located in different properties and different levels of disturbance were selected. Within each area, plants in one plot of 500 m(2), were surveyed considering three strata: upper, middle and inferior. The species were classified in five life forms: tree, scrub, liana, palm and herb; and two functional groups, the pioneer and forest species. Two houndred and eighty-six (286) species, 173 genera and 68 families were found. Most woody species (51 %) occurred in only one stratum. The richness of species was 70 % of estimated richness by Jack-nife of first order. The percentage of rare species was high, 138 species occurred in only one area. In all strata, the trees had higher density, except in inferior stratum, where the grasses were denser. The forest species, in all strata, were dominant. There was significant difference between the forest and pioneer in all forms of life, in all strata. The principal components analysis showed heterogeneity among the studied plots, forming three groups which appear to be related to the different disturbance levels.

TI  - Agroforestry Systems: A Systematic Review Focusing on Traditional Indigenous Practices, Food and Nutrition Security, Economic Viability, and the Role of Women
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This study aimed to identify from the literature review whether agroforestry systems have been an agricultural practice adopted by indigenous peoples for income generation and food and nutritional security. For this, a systematic review was conducted in the period from 2010 to 2020 of 92 articles, dissertations, and theses. Thus, it is found that agroforestry practices are traditional indigenous forms of farming that provide food security, income generation, and medicines, in addition to preserving biodiversity. Indigenous agroforestry is fundamental to indigenous culture, strengthening spiritual practices and the relationship with nature. Women have vital importance in the management of agroforestry practices because, through this productive practice, they ensure the food consumption of the family, besides generating income. However, women still face many difficulties in the countryside because their working hours are longer than those of men; besides not participating in decisions on the choice of species and form of management, in some countries, they still face difficulty accessing and owning land. The studies provide evidence on the economic viability of agroforestry systems. However, research gaps are identified that verify the economic and financial analysis of agroforestry models, which address the concerns of indigenous communities, aiming at food security. These analyses are essential for the implementation and continuity of the production system.

M3  - Article
AB  - ContextHigh rates of deforestation have prompted discussions on the use of agricultural systems for biodiversity conservation. Although agroforests are recognized as supplementary habitats for many species, it is still unclear whether this agricultural system can maintain multiple dimensions of species diversity.ObjectivesWe investigated the impact of landscape and local factors on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic richness and diversity of the herpetofauna in 30 cocoa agroforests located in three different regions of the Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe used Hill's numbers in orders 0 and 1 to estimate the richness and diversity of each dimension of amphibian and reptile communities. Using model selection approach, we evaluate the influence of landscape and local factors on the different dimensions of diversity of both groups.ResultsFor amphibians, we observed that pasture cover positively affects taxonomic richness and diversity, as well as phylogenetic richness. In contrast, forest edge density and number of forest fragments negatively affect richness and functional diversity, respectively. We also observed that the region with high forest cover exhibited lower amphibian functional richness. For reptiles, we found that forest cover and edge density positively affect species richness. We also noted that forest cover and edge density positively affect phylogenetic richness and diversity, respectively. Regarding local factors, only humidity positively affected functional richness and diversity, while temperature had a negative effect on reptile functional richness.ConclusionsOur study showed that the landscape context in which cocoa agroforests are located modulates the ability of this agricultural system to harbor multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Influence of environmental heterogeneity on mirmecofauna in different land uses in the municipality of Bom Despacho, Minas Gerais state
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ant communities can be evaluated in areas with different land uses in order to know the factors that affect species richness, diversity and composition. This study aimed to evaluate the myrmecofauna in cultivated areas and in a remnant of native forest. The myrmecofauna was collected in an agroforestry, an area cultivated with fruit trees (fruit growing), in a pasture and in the Legal Reserve of the Experimental Farm of the Una University Center, municipality of Bom Despacho, State of Minas Gerais. For the sampling of ants, 15 soil traps and the same number of tree traps were used in each area, all containing sardine and honey baits. A total of 45 ant species were collected, belonging to 16 genera. The greatest species richness occurred in the Legal Reserve (29), followed by agroforestry (23), pasture (19) and fruit growing (17). The species accumulation curves indicated that the total species richness was significantly higher in the Legal Reserve than in the other areas. The average species richness of ants collected on the soil was significantly higher in the Legal Reserve and agroforestry area (ANCOVA; F = 5.069; p < 0.01), but litter leaf did not significantly influence species richness (ANCOVA; F = 1.086; p = 0.30). There was no significant difference in the mean richness of ants on trees in the different areas evaluated (ANCOVA; F = 2.014; p = 0.12), not being influenced by height (ANCOVA; F = 0.626; p = 0.43) or trunk circumference (ANCOVA; F = 0.776; p = 0.38) of the trees. The Legal Reserve had the highest Shannon Diversity Index (2,999), followed by agroforestry (2,736), pasture (2,698) and fruit growing (2,349). There was an influence of the land use on the composition of ant species collected on soil and plants. The results show that environmental attributes linked to the heterogeneity of the environment, such as the number of plant species, provided differences in the richness, diversity and composition of ant fauna. The increased structural complexity of the environment can provide the presence of greater ant species richness and diversity.

T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - "Caatinga", dominant vegetation in Brazilian semiarid, has suffered severe degradation process, triggered, among other reasons, by the traditional agricultural and extractive activities. The need to conserve the environment and natural resources in agricultural and forestry activities, led to search for alternatives to conventional production. In this context, agroforestry systems, that integrate trees with crops and livestock, are an alternative operating sustainably. With the aim of studying the potential for preservation tree species of the "Caatinga" in an agrosilvopasture system in semiarid, in Sobral-CE, was evaluated the relatives density, frequency and dominance, the importance value index and the Shannon e Wiener index, of the woody component of this system. It was found that the vegetation management practices of trees and shrubs used in the system decrease density, and interfered in height and diameter distribution of individuals in relation to the original vegetation of the Caatinga. However, these practices were effective in preserving the wealth of flora species of trees and shrubs, similar to the area of native vegetation reserve. Cordia oncocalyx was the species with the highest number of individuals in the system, also showing highest importance value, followed by Mimosa caesalpiniifolia. The family Leguminosae was the most representative. The Shannon index shows that this agrosilvopasture system has the potential to promote an intermediate level of conservation among the "Caatinga" vegetation remnants and disturbed areas in this biome.

TI  - The comparative biodiversity of seven globally important wetlands: a synthesis
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The species diversity data of seven globally important wetlands (Canadian peatlands, Florida Everglades, Pantanal, Okavango Delta, Sundarban, Tonle Sap, and Kakadu National Park) were compared. The available data for most groups of lower plants and animals are insufficient for a comparative analysis. Data on vertebrates and higher plants are more complete and show high species diversity. The large habitat diversity allows the coexistence of amphibious species with many immigrants from connected deepwater and terrestrial habitats. Several of these immigrant species find an important permanent refuge in the wetlands; some use the wetlands as periodic habitats. All wetlands are important habitats for long-distance migratory bird species. The species composition reflects the biogeography of the respective regions, e.g. the high diversity of large ungulates characteristic for Africa is also found in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and the high fish species diversity typical for South America is also reflected in the Pantanal in Brazil. The number of endemic species in most wetlands is low, except in the Everglades. The low numbers are explained to some extent by the dramatically changing paleo-climatic conditions that increased extinction rates, but also by the connection with large river systems that act as migratory and transport routes for species from large catchment areas and hinder the genetic isolation of wetland populations. The high number of endemic species in the Everglades is explained in part by its isolation on a peninsula. The relatively low nutrient status of most wetlands does not negatively affect species diversity and often leads to high animal densities. Large populations of endangered or rare species in all wetlands contribute to the great value of these areas for biodiversity protection. All wetlands are subjected to an increasing degree to human pressure through, e.g. water abstraction, changes in the natural flood regime, land reclamation, pollution, over-utilization of natural resources, and poaching. High habitat diversity and a pronounced natural disturbance regime make some of the wetlands vulnerable to invasion by exotic species, as shown for the Everglades. All studied wetlands are at least in part protected by national and international conventions. This provides perspectives for long-term protection only to a limited extent because of major environmental changes in their surroundings. Further strong efforts are required to match protection and sustainable use of the wetlands proper with management activities in their catchments.

TI  - Current state of knowledge regarding South America wetlands and their future under global climate change
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The exact size of the wetland area of South America is not known but may comprise as much as 20% of the sub-continent, with river floodplains and intermittent interfluvial wetlands as the most prominent types. A few wetland areas have been well studied, whereas little is known about others, including some that are very large. Despite the fact that most South American countries have signed the Ramsar convention, efforts to elaborate basic data have been insufficient, thereby hindering the formulation of a wetland-friendly policy allowing the sustainable management of these areas. Until now, the low population density in many wetland areas has provided a high level of protection; however, the pressure on wetland integrity is increasing, mainly as a result of land reclamation for agriculture and animal ranching, infrastructure building, pollution, mining activities, and the construction of hydroelectric power plants. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted increasing temperatures, accelerated melting of the glaciers in Patagonia and the Andes, a rise in sea level of 20-60 cm, and an increase in extreme multiannual and short-term climate events (El Nio and La Nia, heavy rains and droughts, heat waves). Precipitation may decrease slightly near the Caribbean coast as well as over large parts of Brazil, Chile, and Patagonia, but increase in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, around the equator, and in southeastern South America. Of even greater impact may be a change in rainfall distribution, with precipitation increasing during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season. There is no doubt that the predicted changes in global climate will strongly affect South American wetlands, mainly those with a low hydrologic buffer capacity. However, for the coming decades, wetland destruction by wetland-unfriendly development planning will by far outweigh the negative impacts of global climate change. South American governments must bear in mind that there are many benefits that wetlands bring about for the landscape and biodiversity as well as for humans. While water availability will be the key problem for the continent's cities and agroindustries, intact wetlands can play a major role in storing water, buffering river and stream discharges, and recharging subterranean aquifers.

TI  - Citrus Orchards in Agroforestry, Organic, and Conventional Systems: Soil Quality and Functioning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Citrus crop management has evolved to improve the quality of orchards and production, encompassing agroforestry and agroecological management practices. We sought to analyze different management systems in different seasons of the year, evaluating the quality of the soil physical, chemicals and biological properties, and the herbaceous vegetation occurring in citrus orchards. Five sites were studied: citrus in agroforestry and biodynamic systems (Cs), citrus in biodynamic systems (Co), citrus in conventional systems (Cc), and two forest sites, one with 40 (F40) and another with 200 years of regeneration (F200). Soil properties were evaluated in three layers (0-5, 5-20, and 20-40 cm) in four seasons, while the herbaceous survey was carried out in two of these seasons. The results showed that the Co and Cs orchards had better indicators in terms of chemical (pH, phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, and soil organic carbon (SOC)), physical (soil density, total porosity, and macro- and microporosity), and biological properties (global enzymatic activity) than the Cc management. The agroforestry management was even superior in soil quality, with improved pH levels, microporosity, and feeding behavior of the soil fauna. The most evident temporal variations were for pH, SOC, global enzymatic activity, and feeding activity of the soil fauna. The Cs and Co orchards showed greater richness and abundance of herbaceous species. Organic management favors a timely coverage of multiple benefits, with the presence of the Commoliaceae and Fabaceae families, and offering an ecological effect and green manure of high ecosystem value. In conclusion, agroforestry and biodynamic management systems are the best options to maintain soil quality and functioning for citrus production.

TI  - Effects of intensive human management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ground beetles in a planted forest landscape
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of planted forests harms native biodiversity. Few studies report the effects of replacing wetlands with planted forests on ground beetles. We analyze how the taxonomic and functional diversity of ground beetles are affected by intensive management of a planted forest landscape in the Lower Delta of the Parana River. We defined six habitat types (n = 3, N = 18): young and mature willow (YW, MW), young and mature poplar without cattle (YP, MP), young and mature silvopastoral poplar (YS, MS). Using pitfall traps (N = 1728), we recorded 35 species (1896 individuals). YW and MS reached the highest taxonomic diversity and richness. YW with more vertical heterogeneity showed higher species richness than MW. Hydrophilic species were more abundant in YW. Zoophagous species were more abundant in MS. YS, MS, and YW reached the highest functional evenness, which implies that a large part of the functional niches was used. Cattle dung and freshwater canals for livestock offer more resources for ground beetles. The planted tree species, stand age, and presence of cattle affects taxonomic and functional diversity of ground beetles. Willow and silvopastoral planted forests are the most suitable habitats for hosting wetland species. So, we recommend using willow species rather than poplar species when planted forests replace fluvial wetlands, increasing irrigation of poplar planted forests through ditches and canals, conserving or restoring different strata of understory to increase vertical heterogeneity, and maintaining the landscape heterogeneity. These management measures are essential to prevent the loss of wetland species and conserve ground beetle's diversity.

TI  - The depleted mineralization of the fungicide chlorothalonil derived from loss in soil microbial diversity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are lack of studies regarding the effects of microbial diversity on specific soil functions, such as pesticides degradation. This study evaluated the role of bacterial community diversity and biochar on chlorothalonil (CTN) degradation, using 'dilution to extinction' approach, PCR-DGGE/16S rRNA gene technique, and radiorespirometry (14C-CTN). Biochar and microbial community dilution affected structure of the microbial community. In spite of that, CTN mineralization was slow, but dissipation was very fast (D-50 < 1.0 d) due to immediate chemical degradation and formation of nonextractable (bound) residues. However, any depletion on soil microbial diversity strongly affected CTN mineralization, suggesting that this function is related to less abundant but specific microbial groups (CTN degraders) or to soil microbial diversity. The extent of these effects will strongly depend on the compound nature (recalcitrance) and soil matrix/substrate (bioavailability). It can be corroborated by the fact that biochar affected CTN sorption, its bioavailability, and subsequently its mineralization rate in the NS. These data indicate a strong relationship between soil microbial diversity and pesticide degradation, which is an acting form to mitigate xenobiotics accumulation in the environment.

TI  - Are Dung Beetles Driving Dung-Fly Abundance in Traditional Agricultural Areas in the Amazon?
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the effects of different land-use systems on the ability of dung beetles to control the population of detritus-feeding flies. We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

TI  - Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the Brazilian's Cerrado and in soybean under conservation and conventional tillage
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is the largest savanna biome in the Neotropics and considered a major hotspot for world biodiversity. However, over recent decades the area has increasingly been converted to intensive agricultural ecosystems, primarily for soybean production. Conservation tillage systems have gained major importance in tropical America, especially in the Brazilian Cerrado. Long-term field experiments were established to evaluate the effects of soil tillage on soybean production in the Cerrado. The aim of our study was to determine arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity in three natural savanna forests and compare with AMF communities established in three field experiments focusing on soybean production. Since 2000, these experiments differed only in the crop rotation. In one experiment, the rotation was bi-annual with soybean and maize, in the second soybean was mono-cropped, and in the third the soybean/maize rotation was on a more intensive, annual basis. AMF spores were extracted from the soils, counted and morphologically identified. In total, 63 AMF species, belonging to 20 genera, were detected. Average spore densities and species richness decreased in conventionally tilled systems (3-4 spores g(-1) and 12-17 species), when compared to no-tillage (4-6 spores g(-1) and 15-18 species) and natural savanna (9-11 spores g(-1) and 16-22 species), but AMF evenness (Pielou index) was higher under both tillage systems (0.65-0.77), than in the savanna forests (0.54-0.62). AMF community composition significantly differed between all systems. Indicator species were revealed for all three ecosystems: e.g. Glomus macrocarpum and Sclerocystis sinuosa (Cerrado), Sc. coremioides (no-tillage) and Gigaspora margarita, Racocetra coralloidea and Ra. fulgida (tillage). In conclusion, soil cultivation and fertilizer application lead to decreased AMF species richness but remarkably AMF diversity was maintained on similarly high levels in soybean-based crop production systems, even under intensive soybean mono-cropping. The changes in AMF community structure rather were linked to soil pH and potassium, calcium and magnesium than to phosphorus availability or the organic carbon contents. Several species were unrecoverable from either of the tillage systems following conversion from natural savanna forests to cropland.

Although some agricultural systems, such as agroforests, are considered biodiversity-friendly, there is still a lack of information on how factors acting at different spatial scales shape nest predation in these environments.ObjectivesWe assessed the effects of landscape (native forest cover and total forest cover) and local factors (number of shade trees, cocoa trees, understory plants, and canopy openness) on the number of predated bird nests in cocoa agroforests.MethodsArtificial nests were placed on the ground and in the understory of 30 agroforests located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The agroforests were embedded in three regions with different amounts of native forest remnants and areas designated for cocoa agroforests and cattle pastures. Using GLMM models and the Akaike information criterion, we identified which environmental predictors can determine nest predation in agroforests.ResultsWe detected that ground nests are more vulnerable to predation than understory nests. We also observed higher nest predation in the region dominated by cocoa agroforestry systems than in the region with high forest cover. Our statistical models evidenced an increase in the number of predated nests in agroforests presenting a high number of understory plants and cocoa trees, particularly when located in deforested landscapes.ConclusionsOur study highlighted that the landscape context in which the cocoa agroforests are situated can modulate the effect of local characteristics on the predation of artificial nests.

TI  - Correlation of Carbon Stock and Biodiversity Index at the Small Scale Agroforestry Landscape in Ciliwung Watershed
T2  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM FOR SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Sustainable Landscape Development (ISSLD)
CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Pekarangan is part of a complex of small-scale agroforestry landscape. Pekarangan have 3 functions i.e. ecological, economic, and social. ecological function, for providing landscape services such as carbon stock and biodiversity; economic function, can supplies foods and nutrition; and social function, for building low carbon communities and increasing the environmental awareness. Therefore, this research aims to correlate carbon stocks and biodiversity index of Pekarangan in Ciliwung Watershed. This study has measured 48 samples which were divided in three stream, namely upstream, midstream, and downstream. The samples were divided into four groups, G1 (pekarangan size less than 120 m(2) and doesn't have other agricultural land (no other agricultural land - OAL), G2 (< 120 m(2) with OAL < 1000 m(2)), G3 (120-400 m(2) with no OAL) and G4 (120-400 m(2) with OAL < 1000 m(2)). The results show that correlation between carbon stock and biodiversity index value is R-2 = 0.05. The results showed no correlation between carbon stocks and biodiversity index could be due to the amount of Pekarangan owners who prefer potted plants than plant a tree, so that the carbon sequestered in the Pekarangan only slightly.

TI  - Dung Beetle Community and Functions along a Habitat-Disturbance Gradient in the Amazon: A Rapid Assessment of Ecological Functions Associated to Biodiversity
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there is increasing interest in the effects of habitat disturbance on community attributes and the potential consequences for ecosystem functioning, objective approaches linking biodiversity loss to functional loss are uncommon. The objectives of this study were to implement simultaneous assessment of community attributes (richness, abundance and biomass, each calculated for total-beetle assemblages as well as small-and large-beetle assemblages) and three ecological functions of dung beetles (dung removal, soil perturbation and secondary seed dispersal), to compare the effects of habitat disturbance on both sets of response variables, and their relations. We studied dung beetle community attributes and functions in five land-use systems representing a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon: primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. All response variables were affected negatively by the intensification of habitat disturbance regimes, but community attributes and ecological functions did not follow the same pattern of decline. A hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that, although all community attributes had a significant effect on the three ecological functions (except the abundance of small beetles on all three ecological functions and the biomass of small beetles on secondary dispersal of large seed mimics), species richness and abundance of large beetles were the community attributes with the highest explanatory value. Our results show the importance of measuring ecological function empirically instead of deducing it from community metrics.

TI  - FOREST ANALYSIS IN THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT AT SAO BARTOLOMEU RIVER BASIN, VICOSA-MG
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - - The reduction of forest areas in recent years has influenced landscape fragmentation, compromising ecosystem functions. The natural forest, in addition to maintaining biodiversity, is capable of improving the hydrological conditions of the watershed. This study aimed to characterize the landscape structure of the remaining forest fragments in the Sao Bartolomeu river basin, at the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais State, and to assess their physiographic and pedological representativeness. The study area is responsible for most of Vicosa's water supply, while it is undergoing an urbanization process, reinforcing the need for ordering the use, besides the evaluation of priority areas for conservation. The studies related to the landscape structure were based on the metrics of forest fragments. The representativeness was analyzed regarding the aspects of topographic compartmentation, slope faces, and soils, using the Chi-square test. The natural forest presents fragments varying from medium to large size, with satisfactory proximity between them. However, the forest patches have irregular shapes, favoring the edge effect with a tendency towards irregularity as the fragment size increases. The results of the physiographic and pedological representativeness indicate that the land uses are dependent on the location in the landscape. According to the statistical test, the forest occurs less frequently than expected on the river terraces (48.3%) and convex slopes (2.3%), as well as on the Red-Yellow Acrisols (53.1%), and on the north (28.5%) and west (20.9%) faces. For urban planning and biodiversity conservation purposes, it is recommended to balance the forest area in the different compartments of the landscape, giving priority to the connection of forest fragments.

TI  - Recovery of soil macrofauna communities after forest clearance in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As primary forest is cleared, pastures and secondary forest occupy an increasing space in the Amazonian landscape. We evaluated the effect of forest clearing on a soil macrofauna (invertebrate) community in a smallbolder farming system of southeastern Amazonia. We sampled the soil macrofauna in 22 plots of forest, upland rice fields, pastures, and fallows of different ages. In total, we collected 10, 728 invertebrates. In cleared plots the species richness per plot of the soil macrofauna fell from 76 to 30 species per plot immediately after forest clearance, and the composition of the new community was different. Ants, termites, and spiders were most affected by the disturbance. In plots deforested several years before, the effect of forest clearance was highly dependent on the type of land use (pasture or fallow). In fallows, the community was similar to the initial state. The species richness per plot in old fallows rose to 66, and the composition was closer to the primary forests than to the other types of land use. On the contrary, in the pastures the species richness per plot remained low at 47. In fallows, all the groups showed a richness close to that in primary forest, whereas in the forest only the richness of earthworms and Coleoptera recovered. Our results show that forest clearing constitutes a major disturbance for the soil macrofauna and that the recovery potential of the soil macrofauna after 6 or 7 years is much higher in fallows than in pastures. Thus, fallows may play a crucial role in the conservation of soil macrofauna.

TI  - Monitoring of Natural Enemies (Hymenoptera) on Different Lands Use: Study from Agroforestry, Community Forest, and Pioneer Land
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and management must be carried out to ensure the sustainability of land ecological function. The presence of natural enemies that suppress pest populations is an essential component of the ecological function. Monitoring the presence of natural enemies and avoiding silvicultural activities that threaten the presence of natural enemies are important aspects of land management. This study investigates the presence of natural enemies on three different land uses: agroforestry, community forests, and pioneer lands. Insect monitoring was carried out at an established plot (20 m x 20 m) for three months using passive sampling (pitfalls and sticky traps) placed using a grid and a diagonal method. The study surveyed phytophagous insects, such as leafhoppers, flies, thrips, and aphids. However, most specimens captured were represented by the natural enemies; Hymenoptera consists of predators (Formicidae) and parasitic wasps (Trichogrammatidae and Scelionidae). The results show that community forests and pioneer lands support the existence of Formicidae. This study indicates that in agroforestry, there are variations in the population of Formicidae based on the period of ongoing land management. Agroforestry provides a more suitable place for the existence of Trichogrammatidae and Scelionidae.

TI  - Landscape predictors are more important than local factors in determining multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in shaded cocoa agroforests
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextHigh rates of deforestation have prompted discussions on the use of agricultural systems for biodiversity conservation. Although agroforests are recognized as supplementary habitats for many species, it is still unclear whether this agricultural system can maintain multiple dimensions of species diversity.ObjectivesWe investigated the impact of landscape and local factors on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic richness and diversity of the herpetofauna in 30 cocoa agroforests located in three different regions of the Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe used Hill's numbers in orders 0 and 1 to estimate the richness and diversity of each dimension of amphibian and reptile communities. Using model selection approach, we evaluate the influence of landscape and local factors on the different dimensions of diversity of both groups.ResultsFor amphibians, we observed that pasture cover positively affects taxonomic richness and diversity, as well as phylogenetic richness. In contrast, forest edge density and number of forest fragments negatively affect richness and functional diversity, respectively. We also observed that the region with high forest cover exhibited lower amphibian functional richness. For reptiles, we found that forest cover and edge density positively affect species richness. We also noted that forest cover and edge density positively affect phylogenetic richness and diversity, respectively. Regarding local factors, only humidity positively affected functional richness and diversity, while temperature had a negative effect on reptile functional richness.ConclusionsOur study showed that the landscape context in which cocoa agroforests are located modulates the ability of this agricultural system to harbor multiple dimensions of amphibian and reptile diversity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Abundance and Diversity of Soil Macrofauna in Native Forest, Eucalyptus Plantations, Perennial Pasture, Integrated Crop-Livestock, and No-Tillage Cropping
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive land use can affect macrofaunal biodiversity, which is a property that can be used as a soil quality indicator. This study evaluated the abundance and diversity of soil macrofauna and its relation to soil chemical and physical properties in five land use systems (LUS) in the eastern region of Santa Catarina. The following LUS were studied: native forest (NF), eucalyptus plantations (EP), perennial pasture (PP), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), and no-tillage cropping (NT). The macrofauna was quantified in 0.25 x 0.25 m monoliths and sampled in the 0.00-0.20 m layer in the summer (Jan/2012) and winter (Jul/2012). For each LUS, nine points were sampled, distributed in a 30 x 30 m sampling grid. After screening the edaphic macrofauna organisms, the individuals were counted and identified at the species level when possible, or in major taxonomic groups. The Shannon diversity indices were calculated and the macrofaunal groups together with the physical and chemical properties were subjected to principal component (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). The abundance and diversity of macrofaunal groups are affected by the LUS. The properties of organic matter, macroporosity, bulk density, cation exchange capacity at pH 7.0, base saturation, potential acidity, and exchangeable Al were related to the abundance of soil macrofaunal groups. The stability and biodiversity of soil macrofauna were highest in the LUS of NF, PP, and EP.

TI  - Bacterial community composition of anthropogenic biochar and Amazonian anthrosols assessed by 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar (BC) is a common minor constituent of soils and is usually derived from the burning of wood materials. In the case of Amazonian dark earth (ADE) soils, the increased amount of this material is believed to be due to anthropogenic action by ancient indigenous populations. In this study, we use 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to assess the bacterial diversity observed in the BC found in ADEs as well as in the dark earth itself and the adjacent Acrisol. Samples were taken from two sites, one cultivated with manioc and one with secondary forest cover. Analyses revealed that the community structure found in each sample had unique features. At a coarse phylogenetic resolution, the most abundant phyla in all sequence libraries were Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria that were present in similar relative abundance across all samples. However, the class composition varied between them highlighting the difference between the Acrisol and the remaining samples. This result was also corroborated by the comparison of the OTU composition (at 97 % identity). Also, soil coverage has shown an effect over the community structure observed in all samples. This pattern was found to be significant through unweighted UniFrac as well as P tests. These results indicate that, although the ADEs are found in patches within the Acrisols, the contrasting characteristics found between them led to the development of significantly different communities.

TI  - Tree and palm diversity in homegardens in the Central Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent decades, many studies have shown the important role of agroforestry, and particularly homegardens, in food supply, but few studies conducted in the Amazon include regional coverage and/or a large number of samples. This makes a more thorough assessment of the importance of these agroecosystems in agrobiodiversity conservation difficult. The objective of the present study is to assess the factors that determine the floristic composition and tree and palm diversity of homegardens at different spatial scales in the Central Amazon. 334 homegardens were sampled in rural and urban areas of 14 municipalities in the state of Para. Owners were interviewed for the collection of socioeconomic data. A total of 16,049 individual tree and palm were recorded, distributed in 108 species. Most species were fruit bearing. The correlations between socioeconomic and environmental factors and the floristic gradient established in each ordination were significant only at the local scale. Species richness was influenced by factors related to family income, homegarden size, and topographic environment. The criteria for selecting the species comprised in these homegardens are aimed at the food security of the families that own the homegardens. Thus, the floristic composition of homegardens in the Central Amazon is more strongly influenced by owners' decisions at a local level than by socioeconomic and environmental factors at broader scales. The importance of homegardens to food security and the autonomy of Amazon families indicate that public policies should be designed to stimulate more diverse production systems as a strategy to strengthen family agriculture and agrobiodiversity conservation in the Central Amazon.

TI  - Microbiome resilience of Amazonian forests: Agroforest divergence to bacteria and secondary forest succession convergence to fungi
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An alarming and increasing deforestation rate threatens Amazon tropical ecosystems and subsequent degradation due to frequent fires. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may offer a sustainable alternative, reportedly mimicking the plant-soil interactions of the natural mature forest (MF). However, the role of microbial community in tropical AFS remains largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for evaluating the sustainability of AFS and practices given the key role of microbes in the aboveground-belowground interactions. The current study, by comparing different AFS and successions of secondary and MFs, showed that AFS fostered distinct groups of bacterial community, diverging from the MFs, likely a result of management practices while secondary forests converged to the same soil microbiome found in the MF, by favoring the same groups of fungi. Model simulations reveal that AFS would require profound changes in aboveground biomass and in soil factors to reach the same microbiome found in MFs. In summary, AFS practices did not result in ecosystems mimicking natural forest plant-soil interactions but rather reshaped the ecosystem to a completely different relation between aboveground biomass, soil abiotic properties, and the soil microbiome.

TI  - Identifying barriers and levers of biodiversity mainstreaming in four cases of transnational governance of land and water
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mainstreaming biodiversity into the governance of economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries is required to reverse biodiversity loss and achieve globally adopted conservation targets. Governments have recognized this but little progress has been made. This paper addresses the following research question: What are the barriers and levers for mainstreaming biodiversity into economic sectors that exert high pressure on biodiversity? This question is approached through applying an analytical framework developed from literature on mainstreaming and Environmental Policy Integration as well as governance theory and practice to four cases in agriculture, agro-forestry and fisheries covering multi-level and transnational governance contexts. Decision making and governance in these cases look quite different compared to the kind of public policy machinery of governmental bureaucracies that much EPI literature has focused on. Our analysis demonstrates mainstreaming efforts in some of our cases at the degree of harmonization and even coordination among key actors. It further identifies a number of 'additional' barriers and levers that from an Environmental Policy Integration perspective would be considered as external factors out of reach for mainstreaming efforts. The results are pertinent for the evaluation of EPI performance because the governance perspective expands the borders of who can initiate, enable and sustain mainstreaming, what scope of regulatory norms they can use and the potentially useful resources for the process.

TI  - Soil biological properties in multistrata successional agroforestry systems and in natural regeneration
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of cultivated plants in the agroforestry systems can create conditions to maintain the vital edaphic processes similar to natural regeneration areas. We studied agroforestry systems with five (AF5) and ten years (AF10) of age in comparison with natural regeneration areas for 10 years (NR) in the Atlantic Forest Biome in an area of environmental fragility. The microbial biomass carbon (MB-C), soil basal respiration (BResp), metabolic quotient (q-CO2) and microbial quotient (q-mic) were evaluated in the entire profile of a Typic Udorthents, obtaining stratified data in the 0-2.5; 2.5-5; 5-10; 10-15; 15-30; 30-45 and 45-60 cm layers. The NR area had the highest MB-C (866 mg C kg(-1) soil) and BResp (5 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil h(-1)) in the 0-2.5 cm layer in relation to the AF5 (686 mg C kg(-1) soil; 4 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil h(-1)) and AF10 (478 mg C kg(-1) soil; 4 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil h(-1)). However, the ratios did not differ among treatments, presenting average values in the profile of 7 mg C-CO2 g(-1) MB-C h(-1) for q-CO2 and 1.6 % for q-mic, demonstrating vital process similarity between systems. The phytosociological characteristics that interfere with the microbiological attributes were the plant species richness (0-2.5 cm) and plant diversity (2.5-5 cm). The epiedaphic fauna active in the litter was also assessed by pitfall traps and the average number of individuals per trap (238 for NR, 281 for AF5, 299 for AF10), the order richness (15 for NR; 14 for AF5, 13 for AF10) and relative frequencies did not differ among treatments, confirming that agroforests are in an ecosystem self-regulation condition function similar to natural regeneration, even with the removal of food products and income generation for the farmers.

TI  - Variation in soil carbon, nitrogen and microbial attributes within a silvopastoral system in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is insufficient information about the dynamics of soil organic matter in integrated production systems. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the variations in soil C and N stocks and microbial attributes as a function of the distances apart from the eucalyptus double rows within a silvopastoral system in the Brazilian Cerrado. Four treatments were considered, consisting of four distances (0.5 m, 1.6 m, 3.8 m and 6 m) apart from the double rows of eucalyptus for soil sampling within the silvopastoral system. The soil C and N contents and stocks, C/N ratio, microbial C (Cmic), soil basal respiration, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient were evaluated. Our results showed that soil C contents and stocks were significantly higher near the eucalyptus trees. Soil C stocks ranged from 99.91 (6.0 m) to 119.64 Mg ha(-1)(0.5 m) up to 100 cm soil depth, with an increase of 19.73 Mg ha(-1)nearest of the forest component. The same pattern was observed for N stocks, with values ranging from 9.52 (0.5 m) to 7.95 Mg ha(-1)(6.0 m) and representing an increase of 1.57 Mg ha(-1)near the eucalyptus. We also found an increase of 51.32% in the Cmic at 0.5 m apart from the forest component. Thus, we can infer that the presence of eucalyptus improved the soil quality within the silvopastoral system, indicating that the correct soil sampling and measurements must be performed considering all the transect cultivated with forage grass and double rows of eucalyptus.

TI  - Does biomass production depend on plant community diversity?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to ensure the sustainability of agroecosystems, biodiversity must be a priority. Agroforestry, which includes trees, is an example of such diverse systems. We evaluated plant diversity and aboveground biomass production to assess whether areas under fallow following traditional cultivation return to their initial condition. Also, plant diversity and aboveground biomass production were assessed in agroforestry systems (AFS) to determine if these were similar to unmanaged ecosystems. Another objective of the study was to observe the influence of plant diversity on aboveground biomass production in plant communities and also in the population of the dominant species, Cordia oncocalyx. Plant diversity was evaluated by assessing species richness, as well as using Shannon's (H') and Pielou's (J') indices. Aboveground plant biomass was evaluated in two AFS: agrosilvopastoral (ASP) and silvopastoral (SP), and also in a traditionally managed agricultural system (AG), areas that had been under fallow for six years (F6) and nine years (F9) and an area of unmanaged caatinga (CAT) vegetation. We observed that the ASP system had a lower diversity and number of species, especially tree species. However, it sustained the same total biomass production as CAT and fallow areas. The SP system, despite having lower H' and J' indices as well as lower total biomass production, had a similar number of species to CAT and cropped and fallow systems AG, F6 and F9. Plant biomass in F6 and F9 had recovered to productivity levels of unmanaged CAT vegetation; however the diversity indices were not restored to the same level. Plant diversity did not have an effect on the productivity of the agroecosystems. Likewise, annual biomass production by C. oncocalyx is not dependent upon diversity, but it is influenced by the growth stage of individuals.

TI  - Potential of Chloroleucon acacioides trees as an alternative feed supplement for grazing ruminants in a tropical silvopastoral system
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chloroleucon acacioides (Ducke) Barneby & J.W. Grimes is a nitrogen-fixing legume common in several Brazilian states that produces fruit during the dry season when tropical forages tend to have low biomass production and nutritional value. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical and morphological characteristics of the C. acacioides tree for its use in silvopastoral systems and the benefits of including its fruits in ruminant diets composed mainly of tropical grasses. Thirty C. acacioides trees were randomly selected, and their dendrometric parameters and fruit production were collected. From the fruits, the contents of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, non-structural carbohydrates, and tannins, were analyzed. The in vitro gas production technique was used to evaluate three treatments: CTL: 100% Tifton hay; 20CAC: 20% C. acacioides + 80% Tifton hay; and 100CAC: 100% C. acacioides. The C. acacioides trees had an average height of 6.6 m, a canopy area of 111.8 m2, and an average fruit production of 29.6 kg. The fruits had a high protein and non-structural carbohydrates content. The total tannins content was less than 25 g kg-1 of DM. A greater amount of short-chain fatty acids and microbial biomass was observed for the 20CAC and 100CAC treatments compared to the CTL treatments (P < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that supplementation with only 20% of C. acacioides fruits in ruminants' diet may improve animal nutrition, being a naturally occurring energy and protein supplement for grazing ruminants during the dry season.

TI  - Human dimensions of climate change: the vulnerability of small farmers in the Amazon
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper argues for a twofold perspective on human adaptation to climate change in the Amazon. First, we need to understand the processes that mediate perceptions of environmental change and the behavioural responses at the levels of the individual and the local population. Second, we should take into account the process of production and dissemination of global and national climate information and models to regional and local populations, especially small farmers. We discuss the sociocultural and environmental diversity of small farmers in the Amazon and their susceptibility to climate change associated with drought, flooding and accidental fire. Using survey, ethnographic and archival data from study areas in the state of Para, we discuss farmers' sources of knowledge and long-term memory of climatic events, drought and accidental fire; their sources of climate information; their responses to drought and fire events and the impact of changing rainfall patterns on land use. We highlight the challenges of adaptation to climate change created by the influence of migration and family turnover on collective action and memory, the mismatch of scales used to monitor and disseminate climate data and the lack of extension services to translate large-scale forecasts to local needs. We found that for most farmers, memories of extended drought tend to decrease significantly after 3 years. Over 50% of the farmers interviewed in 2002 did not remember as significant the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought of 1997/1998. This helps explain why approximately 40% of the farmers have not changed their land-use behaviours in the face of the strongest ENSO event of the twentieth century.

TI  - Conservation value of an exotic species: the case of coconuts on the Kayapo indigenous lands, south-eastern Amazonia
T2  - Environment Development and Sustainability
M3  - Article
AB  - In a meeting between FUNAI (the Brazilian Indian National Foundation) and the Kayapo in the Kayapo village of Aukre, in October 2005, the Kayapo Indians requested support to increase the culture of coconuts (Cocos nucifera) in their lands. The introduction of exotic species is a cause of biological diversity loss throughout the world. However, this is by no means applicable to all kinds of exotic species. We argue that the culture of coconuts may actually be a useful tool for the conservation of this country's indigenous lands, despite criticism to the contrary. It may also be useful as source for raw material for the indigenous people who are presently experiencing a population boom. For the Kayapo of south-eastern Amazonia, such a demographic explosion, coupled with their increasing dependence on money to purchase industrialized goods, tend to substantially increase the pressure on their lands, which still contain a substantial amount of well-preserved seasonally-dry Amazonian forests. We investigated the actual economic relevance of coconuts for the Kayapo by measuring human and coconut populations and found that this exotic palm is not important for the subsistence of these Indians, due to coconut scarcity, and that such importance is not forthcoming. In the Amazon, coconuts may be particularly useful for the Indians' nutrition due to the high energetic value of the solid endosperm of the mature fruit. Therefore, given the importance of indigenous lands for the conservation of the Amazonian forests, the encouragement of subsistence coconut cultures in indigenous lands is defensible as a measure for the conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Rhizobia and endophytic bacteria isolated from rainforest fragments within an iron ore mining site of the Eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to isolate and evaluate the diversity of rhizobial and endophytic bacterial strains from undisturbed native rainforests within an iron ore mining site of the Serra Norte de Carajas in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon region to assess their biotechnological utility in reclamation of areas. Experiments were conducted to capture strains from samples of the soil of these forests at the sites Arenito II, Noroeste II, and Sul IV using Macroptilium atropurpureum and Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea as trap host plants. Only M. atropurpureum nodulated, and the different bacterial strains were isolated from its nodules. There was no difference in the number of nodules among the areas, but the Arenito II bacterial community was the most efficient, indicated by the aboveground biomass production and suitable shoot mass/root mass ratio. Fifty-two (52) bacterial isolates were obtained, distributed in five groups, including nodulating and endophytic bacteria: 32 from Arenito II, 12 from Noroeste II, and 8 from Sul IV. The nodulating Bradyrhizobium genus was common to the three areas, whereas Paraburkholderia was found only in Arenito II. The nodD1 gene was amplified in all the strains of both nodulating genera. Strains of the nodulating genus Methylobacterium were also isolated from the three areas; however, they did not nodulate the host of origin, and their nodD1 gene was not amplified. Endophytic strains were also isolated from the genera Paenibacillus, Pantoea, and Leifsonia in Arenito II, Leifsonia in Noroeste I, and Paenibacillus in Sul IV. The greater nodulation and rhizobial and endophytic bacterial diversity observed in Arenito II were probably due to the more suitable edaphic properties of the area. The isolated strains were incorporated in the collection of the Department of Soil Science of UFLA and will be investigated in relation to their symbiotic characteristics with native host plants, as well as their ability to perform other biological processes.

TI  - Rebuilding the Brazilian rainforest: Agroforestry strategies for secondary forest succession
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Does the adoption of agroforestry by small farmers in the Brazilian Amazon promote secondary forest succession on the degraded pastures and crop fields? New results from a small-scale farm agroforestry demonstration project, the Rondonia Agroforestry Pilot Project (RAPP) that began in 1992 are presented in this paper. In 1992, 242 farmers were surveyed by a stratified random sampling protocol, 50 of whom were selected to participate in the RAPP, constituting its experimental group. The remaining 191 farmers served as a control group. Farmers from both groups were re-surveyed in 2002 (after 10 years) and again in 2010 (after 18 years). Annual site visits to the experimental group farms were conducted from 1993 through 2003 to monitor agroforest plot development and management, and changes in pertinent socioeconomic and household demographic characteristics such as household capacity, production systems, and social participation. Differences in property size, number of people permanently residing on the property, and social participation were found between the experimental and control group, with the experimental group having larger properties, more residents, and more participation in mutual aid associations. Control group farmers were also more reliant on cattle production (based on 2009 sales) despite having similar amounts of pasture as farmers in the experimental group. Within the experimental group, very few differences were found between farmers based on the type of agroforestry plot: timber, mixed or non-timber. Remote sensing analyses reveal long-term (10 years+) spectral differences in terms of the similarity to primary forest of both the agroforestry plots and the entire properties of the farms in this study. Experimental group farmers with mixed or timber-based agroforestry plots allowed more secondary forest succession to occur in and around their plots than farmers with non-timber plots. Although, on average, farm properties have become less spectrally similar to primary forest since 1992, properties with agroforestry plots tend to have more secondary succession and/or primary forest on their land in 2011. Several example properties are shown to illustrate the tendency of farmers with agroforestry plots to allow more secondary forest succession to occur on their land. (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Biodiversity impacts of land use simplification: a case study of dung beetles in a landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned and invasive use of natural resources can have irreversible implications for the environment. Appropriate strategies for adequate management could have utmost importance for the conservation of biodiversity. Environments that harbor a huge structural complexity, such as agroforestry systems, even the simplest ones, may host a high species diversity and may therefore ensure the provision of important ecological services. To examine the effect of vegetation structure loss by land use simplification on biodiversity, we evaluate dung beetle (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in different land uses, considering: Brazilian Atlantic Forest, cacao-rubber agroforestry, and rubber monoculture. We found a decreasing gradient of dung beetle diversity from forest to monoculture, as cacao-rubber agroforestry maintaining an intermediate level of dung beetle diversity that is lower than that of the native forest but significantly higher than rubber monoculture. Species composition is rather similar when comparing forest and agroforestry, whereas monoculture holds a different assemblage. Although monoculture farming is still encouraged by the agribusiness market, our results support the idea that agroforestry is a reasonable option to be considered and adapted to compensate the deleterious effects of agriculture intensification on dung beetle diversity. We suggest that such land use would be the best choice to ensure dung beetle diversity maintenance in agricultural landscapes.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of agriculture and cattle raising produces waste, and as a result it can create environmental impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to assess, predict, and lessen the environmental impact for the sustainability of this activity and protection of ecosystems with the intention to fulfil such needs, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Agency (EMBRAPA) has proposed a system, the Environmental Impact Assessment of Agricultural Technology Innovations (Ambitec-Agro). Among countless technological innovations, the agriculture animal husbandry integration was selected which aims to improve the production of farming products in deteriorated areas; intensifying the use of land; and reclaming and renovating agricultural areas and pastures to guarantee agricultural sustainability. Based on a case study, this work aimed to make the assessment of the environmental impact caused by technology innovation of the animal husbandry integration in unirrigated and irrigated areas by applying the Ambitec-Agro system. The assessment of the environmental impact of animal husbandry integration, in the environmental conservation aspect was satisfactory, thus significative and positive indices were obtained in relation to water quality, soil quality and biodiversity in the scope of the studied establishment.

TI  - Grassland community structure in Permanent Preservation Areas associated with forestry and livestock in the Pampa biome, Southern Brazil
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pampa biome comprises a high species richness, but has been transformed by various human activities, threatening its inherent diversity. One of the mechanisms that contributes to conservation is the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA); however, studies related to the vegetation of these areas are scarce, especially regarding the herbaceous stratum, creating a gap in the evaluation of the conservation of the Pampa biome's grassland formations. The objective of this study was to characterize the structure of fragments of grasslands in PPA, with and without cattle grazing, inserted in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna Sm. in the Pampa biome. The survey was conducted on 40 systematically distributed sample units in six grassland areas, three of which were occasionally exposed to grazing and three fenced off with no grazing. Cover and frequency val-ues (absolute and relative) and importance value index (IVI) were estimated for species, exposed soil and dry plant material. The difference between the areas was evaluated by the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and ANOSIM, complemented by SIMPER. Richness, dry plant material and exposed soil were evaluated using the Kruskall-Wallis test. A total of 210 species were registered, with the Poaceae family being the most numerous, followed by Asteraceae (41), Cyperaceae (19), Fabaceae (12) and Rubiaceae (9). The areas differed in relation to richness, with grazing showing more diversity. Enclosure Area 3 did not differ from open areas 2 and 3, possibly due to the greater proximity and low cattle interference. The exposed soil did not vary according to the enclosure; however, the dry plant material was higher in the enclosed areas. The distribu-tion of species, as well as their cover and frequency were regulated according to grazing. The presence of ani-mals in PPA has modified the dynamics and botanical composition of the areas, in which richness was promoted.(c) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Small Mammal Community in a Forest Fragment, Vegetation Corridor and Coffee Matrix System in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of our work was to verify the value of the vegetation corridor in the conservation of small mammals in fragmented tropical landscapes, using a model system in the southeastern Minas Gerais. We evaluated and compared the composition and structure of small mammals in a vegetation corridor, forest fragments and a coffee matrix. A total of 15 species were recorded, and the highest species richness was observed in the vegetation corridor (13 species), followed by the forest fragments (10) and the coffee matrix (6). The absolute abundance was similar between the vegetation corridor and fragments (F = 22.94; p = 0.064), and the greatest differences occurred between the vegetation corridor and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.001) and the forest fragments and the matrix (F = 22.94; p = 0.007). Six species showed significant habitat preference possibly related to the sensitivity of the species to the forest disturbance. Marmosops incanus was the species most sensitive to disturbance; Akodon montensis, Cerradomys subflavus, Gracilinanus microtarsus and Rhipidomys sp. displayed little sensitivity to disturbance, with a high relative abundance in the vegetation corridor. Calomys sp. was the species least affected by habitat disturbance, displaying a high relative abundance in the coffee matrix. Although the vegetation corridors are narrow (4 m width), our results support the hypothesis in which they work as a forest extension, share most species with the forest fragment and support species richness and abundance closer to forest fragments than to the coffee matrix. Our work highlights the importance and cost-effectiveness of these corridors to biodiversity management in the fragmented Atlantic Forest landscapes and at the regional level.

TI  - Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations trapped from soils under agroforestry systems in the Western Amazon
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is an important grain-producing legume that can forego nitrogen fertilization by establishing an efficient symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Although inoculating strains have already been selected for this species, little is known about the genotypic and symbiotic diversity of native rhizobia. Recently, Bradyrhizobium has been shown to be the genus most frequently trapped by cowpea in agricultural soils of the Amazon region. We investigated the genetic and symbiotic diversity of 148 bacterial strains with different phenotypic and cultural properties isolated from the nodules of the trap species cowpea, which was inoculated with samples from soils under agroforestry systems from the western Amazon. Sixty non-nodulating strains indicated a high frequency of endophytic strains in the nodules. The 88 authenticated strains had varying symbiotic efficiency. The SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) index (indirect measurement of chlorophyll content) was more efficient at evaluating the contribution of symbiotic N-2-fixation than shoot dry matter under axenic conditions. Cowpea-nodulating bacteria exhibited a high level of genetic diversity, with 68 genotypes identified by BOX-PCR. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed a predominance of the genus Bradyrhizobium, which accounted for 70 % of all strains sequenced. Other genera identified were Rhizobium, Ochrobactrum, Paenibacillus, Bosea, Bacillus, Enterobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. These results support the promiscuity of cowpea and demonstrate the high genetic and symbiotic diversity of rhizobia in soils under agroforestry systems, with some strains exhibiting potential for use as inoculants. The predominance of Bradyrhizobium in land uses with different plant communities and soil characteristics reflects the adaptation of this genus to the Amazon region.

TI  - Sampling parasitoid wasps (Insecta, Hymenoptera) in cacao agroforestry systems
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present Hymenoptera parasitoid family composition in a cacao agroforestry system, compare it among strata within the system, and evaluate three Malaise trap designs (yellow intercept, duplicated width and bottom addition), to test if: (1) new trap designs increase number of captured families; (2) number of families differ among strata; (3) stratum interferes in number of families captured by each trap type. Our data refer to only eight traps, with no actual replication of the combination of trap design with trap location; therefore, to make possible the statistical test of the hypotheses, we considered number of families captured per day as response variable, and included day as covariate to avoid pseudoreplication. We captured 9700 individuals, in 30 families. All trap adaptations increased number of families collected per day, when compared to standard Malaise trap. Most captures were made by yellow intercept and duplicated width traps. There was a significant interaction of trap type with stratum. Number of families captured per day differed among strata, the highest number of families occurring in cacao gap.

TI  - Extrafloral nectaries of associated trees can enhance natural pest control
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity may increase natural enemy populations because some plants can provide alternative food to natural enemies. Extrafloral nectar is such an alternative food and plants producing extrafloral nectar are known to suffer less from herbivory. Little is known about the effect of plants with extrafloral nectaries on herbivory of neighbouring plants. Here, we investigated whether extrafloral nectaries of an associated tree (Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana) can enhance natural pest control in coffee agroforestry systems. We assessed the effect of nectar availability from Inga trees on parasitism of coffee leaf miners (Leucoptera coffeella) and on damage caused by coffee leaf miners and coffee berry borers (Hypothenemus hampei). Most of the nectary visitors were either parasitoids or predators, with most predators being natural enemies of coffee pests. Coffee plants were sampled every metre along a transect of 10-15 m extending from each Inga tree. The distance of the coffee plants from the Inga trees did not significantly correlate with coffee leaf miner parasitism, proportion of mined leaves or with the proportion of bored coffee berries. We subsequently used abundance and species richness of those nectary visitors without known association with leaf miners and borers as indirect measures of nectar availability. Whereas species richness had no significant effect on natural pest control, leaf miner parasitism increased significantly with the abundance of nectary visitors (excluding natural enemies of the coffee pests), and the proportion of mined leaves decreased significantly with this abundance. The proportion of bored fruits decreased with increasing abundance of visitors, but this trend was not significant. Together, these results suggest that Inga trees provide alternative food to natural enemies of coffee pests, resulting in increased natural control. Thus, extrafloral nectaries of associated trees can enhance natural pest control in agroforestry systems. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - SOIL FAUNA ALONG THE PROCESS OF ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION IN GULLIES REVEGETATED IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF PINHEIRAL - RJ
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity, richness and composition of the soil epigeous fauna community were evaluated in a revegetated gully at the Instituto Federal de Educacao (IFRJ) campus Nilo Pecanha, in the municipality of Pinheiral, Rio de Janeiro state. Revegetation was performed in 2000, and consisted of four different strategies involving N-fixing trees: planting Acacia mangium Willd. (PA); planting Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. (PM); on the outer edges of the gully head (PTS); and planting a mix of legume tree species into the gully (IVR2000). Acacia mangium and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia were planted above the gully head. A nearby 20-year secondary forest remnant was used as a reference site. Ten pitfall traps were used for the sampling of epigeous fauna at each one of the five areas (MOLDENKE, 1994). Sampling was performe in May 2000, June 2006, and April 2008. Six years after revegetation has started, fauna group richness and diversity increased both into the gully and in Mimosa caesalpiniifolia plantation. For the 2000 and 2006 samplings a PCA showed that groups were mostly associated to 2006, and completely opposite to 2000. Acacia mangium plantation had the lowest group richness. In the 2008 sampling, pasture showed the lowest group richness, and according to the PCA groups into the gully were associated to 2008, and completely opposite to 2000 and 2006. Formicidae and Collembola (Entomobryomorpha) were dominant in all sampled areas, both in 2000 and 2008, and into the gully in 2006 as well.

TI  - Farmers' assessment of the use value of agrobiodiversity in complex cocoa agroforestry systems in central Cameroon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems in humid tropical areas are complex multispecies cropping systems whose value for farmers is often hard to assess. We present the findings of a participatory assessment that we applied to cocoa agroforestry systems. This assessment, adapted from the pebble distribution method, was used to quantify the value given by farmers to each species of their cocoa agroforestry system according to the attributed uses. A tree inventory in 50 cocoa agroforests was carried out in central Cameroon. Overall, 122 non-cocoa tree species were inventoried. The mean species richness was 23 species per plot and the mean Shannon index was 2.42, for a mean density of 180 non-cocoa trees ha(-1) and 1,511 cocoa trees ha(-1). Cocoa farmers defined seven different uses for tree species, including Theobroma cacao. 81 % of the species (including cocoa trees) had one to seven uses whereas the highest use value was given to T. cacao, with a mean score of 23.6 %. Then, in descending order, the 10 non-cocoa species with the highest use values were Dacryodes edulis, Persea americana, Elaeis guineensis, Citrus sinensis, Mangifera indica, Milicia excelsa, Cola nitida, Citrus sp., Ricinodendron heudelotii, and Terminalia superba. The frequency of non-cocoa species was significantly and positively correlated with their use value (R-2 = 0.914). Our results showed that technical innovations designed to improve cocoa agroforestry systems should take into account farmers' knowledge to propose them systems so as to be able to more effectively address their expectations.

TI  - Amazonian Dark Earth and Its Black Carbon Particles Harbor Different Fungal Abundance and Diversity
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) is a highly fertile soil of anthropogenic origin characterized by high levels of charred black carbon (BC). It is considered a model of fertility; however, knowledge on the fungal community structure and diversity inhabiting ADE and its BC particles is scarce. Fungal community structure and diversity of ADE and its BC from four sites under different land uses (three agricultural systems and a secondary pristine forest) in the Brazilian Central Amazon were evaluated by 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Fungal communities in ADE and BC were dissimilar and showed differential abundances of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Estimated fungal species richness (abundance-based coverage estimate and Chao-1 index) and diversity estimators (Shannon and Simpson's reciprocal indices) were higher in ADE than in BC in all agricultural areas. No differences were observed in those parameters in ADE and BC samples from the secondary forest. Pezizomycotina fungi and OTUs assigned to Cordyceps confragosa, Acremonium vitellinum, Camarops microspora, and Hirsutella rhossiliensis were more abundant in BC particles than in ADE. These findings represent a breakthrough in our understanding of fungal communities in BC particles from ADE, and will be valuable in future studies considering biochar application in soil.

TI  - Productive sustainability of the installation of silvopastoral systems: A systematic review based on the reality of Peru and Colombia
T2  - REVISTA CORPOICA-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA AGROPECUARIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Saucedo-Uriarte, M. Linares & la silvopastoriles: la y e3048. https://doi.org/10.21930/rcta.vol24_nu m2_art:3048 Abstract: Most of the world's livestock is developed in open field or monoculture systems, which generates economic and environmental losses, such as soil erosion, loss of biodiversity of flora and fauna, low meat and milk production, and less monetary income. Faced with this situation, there are sustainable alternatives for livestock production, which are friendly to the environment, being silvopastoral systems. That is why, in this review, it is proposed to analyze the productive sustainability of the installation of silvopastoral systems, placing greater emphasis on the floristic composition of plots with silvopastoral systems in Peru and Colombia, as a case study. The information review was based on the PRISMA statement considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comparisons were made of pasture production and quality, productivity of dairy and fattening cattle, social and environmental opportunities, and the floristic composition of such silvopastoral systems. The installation of silvopastoral systems increases the productive yields of pastures (dry matter, digestibility and protein), of animals such as greater milk and meat production, and greater biodiversity of forage species. In both countries it is observed that the implementation of these systems has improved opportunities for producers dedicated to livestock due to the beneficial economic, environmental and social impacts that they provide. In this sense, it is a challenge for scientists, governments and entities involved in sustainable systems to continue looking for new viable alternatives and validate them for livestock production.

TI  - Diversity of filamentous fungi in different systems of land use
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial population and activity can be influenced by changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the soil. The objective of this study was to compare fungal diversity under different agricultural management systems and associated differences in soil properties. This research was carried out in three areas, representing the Atlantic Forest, AFS and cassava ( Crantz) monoculture system. Five composite samples were collected during the rainy and dry seasons from each area. Using the composite soil samples, fungal isolation was carried out using a serial dilution technique. Physical, chemical and DGGE analyses of the filamentous fungi community were performed. The fungal isolation data were used to calculate ecological indices of diversity, species richness, equitability, dominance, similarity and density. In general, Atlantic Forest soil presented the highest ecological indices followed by the AFS. The DGGE technique revealed that the structure of the soil mycobiota of the Atlantic Forest and AFS are more than 50% similar. The data indicate that the similarity of the structure and composition of soil mycobiota between AFS and Atlantic Forest is mainly due to the conservation of above-ground plant diversity, and the conservation of soil characteristics can be attributed to the absence of pesticides and fertilizers.

TI  - Effect of Sugarcane Burning or Green Harvest Methods on the Brazilian Cerrado Soil Bacterial Community Structure
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most important biodiversity reservoirs in the world. The sugarcane cultivation is expanding in this biome and necessitates the study of how it may impact the soil properties of the Cerrado. There is a lack of information especially about the impacts of different sugarcane management on the native bacterial communities of Cerrado soil. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate and compare the soil bacterial community structure of the Cerrado vegetation with two sugarcane systems.Methods: We evaluated samples under native vegetation and the impact of the two most commonly used management strategies for sugarcane cultivation (burnt cane and green cane) on this diversity using pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR of the rrs gene (16S rRNA).Results and Conclusions: Nineteen different phyla were identified, with Acidobacteria (approximate to 35%), Proteobacteria (approximate to 24%) and Actinobacteria (approximate to 21%) being the most abundant. Many of the sequences were represented by few operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 3% of dissimilarity), which were found in all treatments. In contrast, there were very strong patterns of local selection, with many OTUs occurring only in one sample. Our results reveal a complex bacterial diversity, with a large fraction of microorganisms not yet described, reinforcing the importance of this biome. As possible sign of threat, the qPCR detected a reduction of the bacterial population in agricultural soils compared with native Cerrado soil communities. We conclude that sugarcane cultivation promoted significant structural changes in the soil bacterial community, with Firmicutes phylum and Acidobacteria classes being the groups most affected.

TI  - Use of wood residues for the cultivation of edible mushroom Lentinus strigosus in the Amazon
T2  - Acta Amazonica
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to use wood residues from the state of Amazonas for the cultivation of Lentinus strigosus. found in that region. The strain came from the collection of the National Institute of Amazonian Research. Sawdust species Simarouba amara, Ochroma piramidale and Anacardium giganteum were separately used in the preparation of the substrates, supplemented with rice and wheat bran and CaCO3 (80:10:8:2), respectively, with humidity adjusted to approximately 75%. Substrates (500 g) were packed using bags polypropylene, sterilized at 121 degrees C for 30 minutes, inoculated and incubated in an acclimatized chamber at 25 +/- 3 degrees C and relative air humidity of 85% until primordia emission, with temperature reduced from 25 to 23 +/- 1 degrees C and air relative humidity increased to 85-90% in the fruiting period. Micelial growth occurred within 12 to 20 days and primordia appeared within 15 to 25 days after the inoculation. Harvest occurred three to five days after primordia emission. Biological efficiency (BE, %), yield (g kg(-1)) and loss of organic matter (PMO, %) were evaluated. Supplemented sawdust were efficient in the cultivation of L. strigosus, presenting BE of 38, 48 and 59%, yield of 98, 119 and 177 g kg(-1) and PMO of 42, 59 and 48% for Simarouba amara, Ochroma piramidale and Anacardium giganteum, respectively. The results show the potential use of those residues in the Amazon, as well as the possibility of using the wild strain, to contribute to the improvement of the social and economical conditions of the regional population and sustainability of the biodiversity resources.

TI  - Species richness and biomass explain spatial turnover in ecosystem functioning across tropical and temperate ecosystems
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting ecosystem functioning at large spatial scales rests on our ability to scale up from local plots to landscapes, but this is highly contingent on our understanding of how functioning varies through space. Such an understanding has been hampered by a strong experimental focus of biodiversity ecosystem functioning research restricted to small spatial scales. To address this limitation, we investigate the drivers of spatial variation in multitrophic energy flux a measure of ecosystem functioning in complex communities at the landscape scale. We use a structural equation modelling framework based on distance matrices to test how spatial and environmental distances drive variation in community energy flux via four mechanisms: species composition, species richness, niche complementarity and biomass. We found that in both a tropical and a temperate study region, geographical and environmental distance indirectly influence species richness and biomass, with clear evidence that these are the dominant mechanisms explaining variability in community energy flux over spatial and environmental gradients. Our results reveal that species composition and trait variability may become redundant in predicting ecosystem functioning at the landscape scale. Instead, we demonstrate that species richness and total biomass may best predict rates of ecosystem functioning at larger spatial scales.

TI  - THE ROLE OF TRADITIONAL AGROFORESTS IN THE CONSERVATION OF RAIN-FOREST BIRD DIVERSITY IN SUMATRA
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird community composition and structure were compared among three different types of traditionally managed agroforests and the nearby primary forests in southwestern Sumatra during the breeding season. The agroforests were dominated respectively by rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), damar (Shorea javanica), and durian (Durio zibethinus) and were managed for cash crops (latex, resin, fruits, spices, coffee and timber). Although planted on formerly clearfelled and cultivated areas, these agroforests were highly diversified and structurally complex. Species relative abundance was obtained in 112 random samples of 50 individuals within limited census areas. The species were classified according to size, main diet, and observed habitat use. Eighty-three percent of all the regional pool of resident species were recorded at least once (excluding aerial, nocturnal, and aquatic species). Species richness, diversity, and equitability were all significantly lower (12% to 62% less) in every agroforest than in the primary forest, and the coefficients of similarity between the natural and managed forest communities were low (0.43-0.55). Less than half the lowland primary forest species known from western Sumatra were recorded in at least one agroforest. Among the 216 species occurring in samples, 56% significantly decreased in or disappeared from agroforests, whereas only 22% appeared or increased. The species most affected by the conversion of primary forests were large frugivores and large insectivores of the canopy and low understory, or terrestrial interior forest specialists. Species thriving in agroforests were small frugivores, foliage insectivores, and nectarivores often orginally associated with gaps. The factors affecting biodiversity in agroforests may involve reduced tree height, canopy foliage volume, vertical diversity of the vegetation structure, floristic richness, and associated variety of food resources. High hunting pressure may also be a factor. These multipurpose, traditionally managed agroforests still are a valuable compromise between conservation of tropical forest biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources. They also function as buffer zones between densely populated and protected areas and are one of the most successful examples of silviculture of dipterocarps. Yet they are not equivalent to primary forests.

TI  - Rhizobial diversity in shrub-tree legume-based silvopastoral systems
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral systems based on tree legumes intercropped with forage grasses can harbor a high diversity of rhizobia, and these bacteria are good indicators of soil quality in several management systems. The objective of this work was to evaluate the morphophysiological, genetic and symbiotic diversity of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] rhizobia from soils under silvopastoral systems based on shrub-tree legumes. The experiment was performed in a randomized block design with three treatments and three replications, consisting of signalgrass (Urochloa decumbens Stapf.) intercropped with sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia); signalgrass intercropped with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and single signalgrass. The samples were collected in the legume row (0 meter) and 4 and 8 meters away. Later, cowpea was used as a trap plant to capture the rhizobia. All strains were phenotypically characterized, authenticated, and genetically identified. Phenotypical characterization of the 431 isolates showed high diversity forming 69 groups at 100% similarity, of which 60 were able to nodulate cowpea during the authentication, and 36 presented relative efficiency superior or equal to the recommended bacteria for the crop. Most of the sequenced strains belonged to Bradyrhizobium (67%) and Methylobacterium (9%). Leifsonia (9%), Cohnella (6%), Rhizobium (3%), Burkholderia (3%), and Paenibacillus (3%) were also represented. Soils under silvopastoral systems harbor efficient rhizobia populations in cowpea with a high genetic diversity, which can be recommended for agronomic efficiency assays.

TI  - Co-production of agroecological innovations to improve sustainability in South American fruit farms
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification and expansion are the main drivers of biodiversity loss that continue to increase this century, especially in South America. International markets and global policy provide incentives and frameworks to address this, but these are unlikely to be effective unless farmers on the ground are enabled and motivated to respond to them by developing long-term solutions that fit their production systems and local contexts. Here, we use a multi-actor transdisciplinary approach to co-design and test agroecological innovations suitable for intensive, exporting South American fruit farms. We focus on highly biodiverse regions experiencing habitat loss in the Mediterranean and dry tropical forest regions of Chile and Brazil, respectively. The innovations were designed to support local biodiversity without compromising productivity or quality. Fourteen farmers participated throughout the project, covering a total of 4178 ha of intensive table grape, mango and cherry production. All were under pressure from buyers to report action on biodiversity. Farmers worked with researchers and industry representatives through an iterative process of dialogues and workshops to select, co-design and implement three agroecological innovations: perches for birds of prey, cover crops and native hedgerows. Farmers became engaged in monitoring their effectiveness and redesigning them to suit local contexts. We develop an extensive set of resources for ongoing dissemination, including an online sustainability metric to report the practices carried out. Eight farms continued to implement at least one agroecological innovation beyond the end of the project, motivated by its fit to their management system and their ability to report positive actions in their supply chains. Policy implications. Our model of knowledge co-production demonstrates how transdisciplinary research in agriculture, fully localised in a particular food-producing context, can enable farmers in the global South to engage with biodiversity conservation in response to top-down market signals incentivising sustainability. We argue that many top-down effort to enhance the sustainability of food supply chains, whether through market incentives, voluntary codes or trade regulations, requires locally based knowledge co-production, in which multiple stakeholders from agriculture and the food industry can benefit from working with locally based researchers.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.La intensificacion y expansion de la agricultura son los principales motores de la perdida de biodiversidad durante este siglo, especialmente en Sudamerica. Los mercados internacionales y la politica global ofrecen incentivos y marcos para abordar esto, pero es poco probable que sean efectivas a menos que los agricultores esten capacitados y motivados para responder a ellos, desarrollando soluciones a largo plazo que se adapten a sus sistemas de produccion y contextos locales. En este trabajo, utilizamos un enfoque transdisciplinario de multiples actores para co-disenar y probar innovaciones agroecologicas adecuadas para predios de produccion fruticola intensivas y exportadoras de Sudamerica. Nos enfocamos en regiones de gran biodiversidad que experimentan perdida de habitat, en las regiones mediterranea y de bosque tropical seco de Chile y Brasil, respectivamente. Las innovaciones se disenaron para apoyar la biodiversidad local sin comprometer la productividad o calidad de la produccion. Catorce agricultores participaron en todo el proyecto, abarcando un total de 4.178 ha de produccion intensiva de uva de mesa, mango y cereza. Todos estaban mandatados por los compradores para que informaran de las medidas adoptadas en materia de biodiversidad. Los agricultores trabajaron con investigadores y representantes de la industria a traves de un proceso iterativo de dialogos y talleres para seleccionar, co-disenar e implementar tres innovaciones agroecologicas: perchas para aves rapaces, cultivos de cobertura y setos nativos. Los agricultores se involucraron en monitorear su efectividad y redisenarlos para adaptarlos a los contextos locales Desarrollamos un amplio conjunto de recursos para la difusion continua, incluida una metrica de sostenibilidad en linea para informar sobre las practicas implementadas. Ocho predios siguieron aplicando al menos una innovacion agroecologica una vez finalizado el proyecto, motivadas por su adecuacion a su sistema de gestion y su capacidad para informar de acciones positivas en sus cadenas de suministro. Implicancia politica. Nuestro modelo de coproduccion de conocimiento demuestra como la investigacion transdisciplinar en agricultura, localizada en un contexto particular de produccion de alimentos, puede permitir a los agricultores del Sur comprometerse con la conservacion de la biodiversidad en respuesta a las senales del mercado que incentivan la sostenibilidad. Sostenemos que muchos esfuerzo de arriba hacia abajo para mejorar la sostenibilidad de las cadenas de suministro de alimentos, ya sea a traves de incentivos de mercado, codigos voluntarios o regulaciones comerciales, requiere una coproduccion de conocimientos basado en el lugar, en la que multiples partes interesadas de la agricultura y la industria alimentaria pueden beneficiarsr al trabajar con investigadores locales.A intensificacao e a expansao agricola sao os principais fatores relacionados a perda de biodiversidade, que continua a aumentar neste seculo, especialmente na America do Sul. Os mercados internacionais e o cenariopolitico global fornecem incentivos e estrutura para lidar com este problema, mas e improvavel que estes sejam eficazes a menos que os agricultores estejam capacitados e motivados a desenvolver solucoes de longo prazo que se adaptem aos seu sistema de producao e contexto local. Aqui, utilizamos a abordagem transdisciplinar envonvedo multiplos atores para co-desenvolver e testar inovacoes agroecologicas adequadas a fazendas de fruticultura intensiva e exportadoras da America do Sul. Nos enfocamos areas com elevada biodiversidade, atingidas por perda de habitat, situadas em regiao mediterranea ede floresta tropical seca no Chile e no Brasil, respetivamente. As inovacoes foram concebidas para apoiar a biodiversidade local sem comprometer a produtividade ou a qualidade. Catorze agricultores participaram do projeto, abrangendo area total de 4.178 ha com producao intensiva de uva de mesa, manga e cereja.

Os agricultores trabalharam com pesquisadores e representantes da industria atraves de um processo iterativo de dialogo e grupo de trabalho, para selecionar, co-desenvolver e implementar tres inovacoes agroecologicas: poleiros para aves de rapina, cultivo de cobertura e faixas com plantas nativas. Os agricultores empenharam-se em monitorar a eficacia e desenvolver adaptacoes para adequa-las ao contexto local. Desenvolvemos um conjunto amplo de recursos para divulgacao continua, incluindo uma metrica de sustentabilidade online para comunicar as praticas realizadas. Oito agricultores continuaram a implementar pelo menos uma inovacao agroecologica apos a finalizacao do projeto, motivados pela sua adequacao ao sistema demanejo e por representar acao positiva para a cadeia de abastecimento. Implicacoes para as politicas.

TI  - Urban agroforestry home gardens in southern Amazon: the agrobiodiversity guardians?
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry home gardens are an ancient practice in various parts of the world and play important economic, cultural and conservation roles for native agrobiodiversity. Thus, the main objective of this study was to carry out a survey of plant species in urban agroforestry homegardens in Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso state, in southern Amazon, as well as analyze whether they contribute to the conservation of agrobiodiversity. For this purpose, a floristic survey was carried out in 30 urban agroforestry home gardens in 17 neighborhoods, using the guided tour technique. This visit consisted of a walk in the home garden in the company of the maintainer, gathering information about the species. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted. For the in situ identification of plant species, individuals were registered by their popular names and a photographic record was made. The data were analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener index, equability, frequency, absolute and relative densities, importance value index and floristic similarity carried out through cluster analysis. For this, the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient and the UPGMA methods were used. The calculations of variables and indexes were performed using the FITOPAC 2.1 program. The statistical analysis used was descriptive. Seventy-two (72) botanical families, 7,106 individuals and 243 species were found. The home garden has a density of 947.47 and a Shannon Wiener index of 4.06. The home gardens showed low similarity. The average home garden area is 0.25 ha. There was a high diversity of botanical families, individuals and species per home garden, grouped into eight categories of use: fruit, vegetables, spices, grains, timber, medicinal, ornamental and shading. The most important use category is medicinal. The floristic composition of the 30 home gardens is heterogeneous. In Alta Floresta, where grazing and soy monoculture is prevalent, urban agroforestry home gardens are a way of conserving agrobiodiversity and also contribute to the local fauna.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in buffelgrass pasture under intercropping and shading systems in Brazilian semiarid conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intercropping of grasses and legumes has been suggested as an alternative for ensuring pasture sustainability. However, few studies have focused on the impact of intercropping and shading on the soil microbiota in semi-arid regions. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of intercropping a grass, Cenchrus ciliaris, with a legume, Clitoria ternatea, under different levels of shading, on the C. ciliaris carbohydrate concentration and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community over time. Soil samples were collected at four sampling times: before intercropping (BI) and after 120, 165 and 210 days cultivation. Four levels of shading were tested: 0 (full sunlight), 26, 39 and 55%. In the intercropped system, mycorrhizal colonization was higher under lower shading levels after 120 and 165 days cultivation, but the number of glomerospores was higher under higher shading levels. After 165 days cultivation, the carbohydrate concentrations were higher under full sunlight. After 210 days cultivation, the reducing carbohydrate concentrations were higher in the intercropped system. Thirty-one AMF species were detected; Acaulospora and Glomus species were predominant compared with the remaining genera. This study showed that AMF community composition was relatively similar between shading and intercropping by multidimensional scaling (MDS) and PERMANOVA analysis, and it was observed only sampling time effect on the AMF community. The Shannon diversity index showed a reduction in AMF diversity from 210 days of cultivation and an increase in the AMF species richness over time. It was concluded that pastures of C ciliaris under shading and intercropping with C ternatea did not modify the AMF community composition. However, the results suggest that intercropping of these plant species may result in AMF species selection over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of biodiversity goods for the sustainable development of the chagra in an indigenous community of the Colombian Amazon: local values of crops
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The chagra is the agroforestry system adapted to the characteristics of the Amazon region. Recently, there has been a reported loss of biodiversity and traditional knowledge associated with the chagras. This paper characterizes the cultivators, exploring knowledge and expressed value perception in the context of the Amazonian chagra of an indigenous community; also, this prioritizes species, under the optics of commercial opportunity. Methods A semi-structured instrument was applied to 14 volunteers, asking about marketing preferences and use values of the species; later, a floristic inventory and prioritization workshop was developed. Results Sixty-two percent of the participants were 50 years or older at the time of the interview. Open conversations showed that traditional knowledge is a matter of practice; and is maintained mainly by the older "grandfathers". Thirty-eight species, belonging to 28 different families, were reported, showing considerable diversity. Seventy-nine percent of the participants consider the Leticia market and sales to tourists as the main marketing scenarios. Conclusions The Ziora-Amena community centralizes the handling of chagras in the community's older adults, who transmit their traditional knowledge to new generations through oral tradition. Indicators of preference, use, and abundance highlight the food species. The perception of the trade stakeholder encourages research and development of endemic species, with health properties or ingredients for industry, which represent an opportunity of high added value for the region.

TI  - Differentiation in the fertility of Inceptisols as related to land use in the upper Solimoes river region, western Amazon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Solimoes river region, western Amazon, is the homeland of indigenous populations and contains small-scale agricultural systems that are important for biodiversity conservation. Although traditional slash-and-burn agriculture is being practiced over many years, deforestation there is relatively small compared to other Amazon regions. Pastures are restricted to the vicinity of cities and do not spread to the small communities along the river. Inceptisols are the main soil order (>90%) in the area and have unique attributes including high Al content and high cation exchange capacity (CEC) due to the enrichment of the clay fraction with 2:1 secondary alummosilicates. Despite its importance, few studies have focussed on this soil order when considering land use effects on the fertility of Amazon soils. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in soil fertility of representative land use systems (LUSs) in the Upper Solimoes region, namely: primary rainforest, old secondary forest, young secondary forest, agroforestry, pasture and agriculture. LUSs were significantly differentiated by the chemical attributes of their topsoil (0-20 cm). Secondary forests presented soil chemical attributes more similar to primary rainforest areas, while pastures exhibited the highest dissimilarity from all the other LUSs. As a whole, soil chemical changes among Inceptisols dominated LUSs showed patterns that were distinct from those reported from other Amazon soils like Oxisols and Ultisols. This is probably related to the presence of high-activity clays enriched in exchangeable aluminum that heavily influenced the soil chemical reactions over the expected importance of organic matter found in most studies conducted over Oxisol and Ultisol.

TI  - The role of local and regional processes in shaping dung beetle communities in tropical forest plantations in Borneo
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine whether rain forest dung beetle species found in plantations in Sabah, northern Borneo, tend to be endemic or geographically widespread. In addition, linear regressions of abundance vs. distance from a major river in primary rain forest are calculated to see if species found in plantation forest show affinity to one specific biotope (riverine vs. interior forest) in their natural habitat. Results show that 14 of the 40 species recorded from plantations are endemic to Borneo. Only edge-specialist endemic species are found in plantation forest, with no interior-forest specialists recorded. Data suggest that endemic species that are adapted to more exposed conditions in primary rain forest, such as riverine species, can in some instances tolerate man-made habitats. Twenty-nine species (+/- SE 4.0) per transect are recorded from plantation transects, whereas 44.2 (+/- 1.7 SE) are recorded in primary rain forest. As species richness is much lower in plantations than natural forest, implying loss of biodiversity, we conclude that measures of biogeographic distinctiveness, whereby endemic species confer higher values, may be misleading unless they take into account edge-affinity. Local- as well as regional-distributional data may therefore be needed to interpret correctly patterns of species assemblages in derived forest ecosystems.

TI  - Plant community diversity relative to human land uses in an Amazon forest colony
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined numbers of plant species and individuals relative to land use in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon. Land uses were forest, cropped after forest, fallows, cropped after fallow, and pasture. These corresponded roughly to farmers' land-use changes over time. Numbers of species and diversity indices were generally highest in forest, but we found quite similar values in older fallows as a result of both survival/re-establishment of forest species and emergence of plants not encountered in forest. The dominant species in fallows, however, were different from those in forest. Lands cropped using slash-and-burn maintained moderate numbers of species-both forest and non-forest. Trends in plant density (individuals per unit ground area) on cropped lands were mainly related to invasion of weedy species (increasing in time after slash-and-burn) and shifts in crop species (replacement of small-sized rice by larger-sized maize and cassava). Useful forest plants (e.g. for construction purposes, food and medicines) decreased with land conversion, although new species also appeared. The fewest species, tree species, and useful plants, and the greatest losses of the forest flora, were encountered in pastures. Consequently, conversion to pasture rather than slash-and-burn agriculture per se led to high biodiversity loss.

TI  - High phosphorus availability promotes the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal spores' community in different tropical crop systems
T2  - BIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to evaluate the effects of tropical crop systems and phosphorus (P) availability on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spores' community composition, and soil chemical properties in a Planosol at Tropical ecosystem from Brazilian Northeast. We collected rhizospheric samples containing soil and root fragments in a 5-year field experiment considering two groups of crop systems, i.e., no-till monocropping and agroforestry system, and testing two factors: the cropping system and the soil P availability. We identified the AMF community composition based on AMF spore's morphology. We also characterized the soil chemical properties (e.g., soil pH, soil organic carbon, and available P) at samples level. Crop systems and soil P availability influenced the AMF community composition, and soil chemical properties. We found that: i) the abundance of Claroideoglomus claroideum, C. etunicatum, Rhizophagus intraradices, richness, Shannon's index and Simpson's index were positively correlated with no-till monocropping systems (Arachis hypogaea, Gossypium hirsutum, and Vigna unguiculata) and with all the studied agroforestry systems at low-P availability; and ii) soil pH, and soil organic carbon were positively correlated with no-till monocropping systems (Arachis hypogaea, Glicine hirsutum, Glicine max, and Sesamum indicum) at high-P availability, and Glicine max, Sesamum indicum, Zea mays, and agroforestry system at low-P availability. Our results highlight the positive effect of high P on AMF spores' diversity, and the importance to consider both the crop system and soil P availability as key-factors promoting shifts into the AMF community composition and soil chemical properties in Tropical conditions.

TI  - Seed rain in cocoa agroforests is induced by effects of forest loss on frugivorous birds and management intensity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests have been intensively degraded and deforested for different anthropogenic uses, mostly associated to agricultural expansion due to increasing human demands. Therefore, an emerging number of studies has advocated on the benefits of land-sharing strategies such as agroforestry systems which conciliate biodiversity conservation with production. Yet features at both landscape and local scales could affect ecological processes and productivity within agroforests. Here, we used structural equation models to investigate the direct and indirect effects of landscape forest cover, animal seed dispersers and local vegetation variables on the seed rain structure of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We sampled seed rain for 12 consecutive months, performed bird and bat surveys and measured local structure variables related to management intensification (i.e., lower abundance and richness of adult trees and lower canopy shading indicating farm intensification) in 15 farms embedded within landscapes showing varying forest cover amount (2.3?74.9 %). Our results indicate that total and animal-dispersed seed richness in cocoa agroforests increased in more forested landscapes induced by the frugivorous bird richness, whereas the abundance of total and animaldispersed seeds was greater in more shaded farms. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of total and animal-dispersed trees negatively influenced the richness of frugivorous birds, thus indirectly affecting the richness of total and animal-dispersed seeds. Finally, we observed a weak similarity among the composition of arrived seeds and adult trees of animal-dispersed species recorded in the same sampling sites, suggesting that several seeds were actively dispersed from other localities. Our results therefore demonstrate that landscape forest amount and local management intensification play key roles in determining the seed diversity reaching cocoa agroforestry farms. We emphasize the importance of retaining native vegetation cover around the cocoa agroforestry, by either preserving the existing forest remnants or promoting restoration programs within deforested landscapes, in addition to locally ensure tree shading to boost seed arrival and enhance ecosystem functionality.

TI  - Density and diversity of diazotrophic bacteria isolated from Amazonian soils using N-free semi-solid media
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-symbiotic diazotrophic bacteria are amongst the most important functional groups of soil-dwelling microorganisms. These bacteria contribute to plant growth predominantly through biological N-2 fixation. Here, we evaluated the density and diversity of non-symbiotic diazotrophic bacteria in soils taken from diverse land use systems (LUS) in Amazonia using nitrogen-free media. A total of 30 soil samples were collected from the following LUS: pristine forest, young secondary forest, old secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. Bacterial density was evaluated by the most probable number (MPN) method utilizing N-free semi-solid media with varied compositions (JNFb, NFb, LGI and Fam). Individual isolates were characterized by colony and cellular morphology as well as total protein profiles and nitrogenase activity. Isolate genotypes were determined by partial 16S rDNA sequences. No typical diazotrophic growth in the JNFb medium was observed. Bacterial densities in the NFb medium were higher in the agriculture and agroforestry soil samples. In LGI and Fam media, bacterial densities were highest in the pasture soil samples. Overall, 22 isolates with high phenotypic diversity were obtained. Eleven isolates exhibited nitrogenase activity. Sequences of 16S rDNA genes of 14 out of 19 isolates had similarities below 100 % with known nitrogen-fixing species. Isolates were identified as belonging to the Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Serratia, Klebsiella, and Bacillus genera. A higher number of isolates from pasture soil samples were isolated, with the majority of these belonging to the Burkholderia and Bacillus genera. Among the isolates, unknown sequences were obtained, possibly indicating new species. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Fam, NFb, and LGI semi-solid media allowed the growth of diazotrophic bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic lines.

TI  - Nitrogen-fixing bacteria communities occurring in soils under different uses in the Western Amazon Region as indicated by nodulation of siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum)
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding native communities is a crucial step for the management of biological nitrogen fixation, since they may be either a source of efficient strains or a limiting factor when efficient strains need to be introduced. This work aimed to evaluate the density, diversity and efficiency of Leguminosae nodulating bacterial (LNB) communities and their component strains in soils under various land use systems (LUSs): pristine forest, agriculture, pasture, agroforestry, young secondary forest, and old secondary forest,. The LNB communities were trapped from these soils by using the promiscuous host siratro under controlled conditions. We also studied their relationships with physical and chemical attributes of the soil. Agroforestry and agriculture soil samples induced the highest number of nodules in siratro, while forest soil samples induced the lowest number of nodules. No relationship was found between LNB and Leguminosae species diversity in the LUSs. The soil chemical variables that were most related to differences in nodule number and shoot dry matter weight of plants inoculated with soil suspensions of the LUSs were, respectively: Ca2+, Mg2+, base saturation, exchangeable bases and Cu2+; and pH, cation exchange capacity, B, Cu2+ and clay. Although, LNB communities from all LUSs were efficient under controlled and similar conditions, they were found to be composed of strains with variable efficiency: inefficient, efficient, highly efficient and superior efficiency. Efficient strains occurred at the highest frequency in all LUSs. The isolated strains presented similar and new sequences that were phylogenetically related to well known LNB genera in alpha-and beta-Proteobacteria. Unusual genera in these branches, as well as in other branches, which are probably endophytic bacteria, were also isolated from nodules. These data support siratro as a useful trap species to study the LNB biodiversity of diverse ecosystems in tropical soils. The fact that the highest diversity and nodulation were seen in managed systems such as agriculture and agroforestry suggests a high resilience of LNB communities to changes in land use after deforestation in a region where large forest areas are still preserved and can be a source of propagules.

TI  - Wild ungulate responses to anthropogenic land use: a comparative Pantropical analysis
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Escalating human development has severely threatened natural ecosystems, especially in the Tropics, resulting in the wholesale replacement and fragmentation of native habitats and their biotas. As a result, wild vertebrates have often become isolated in natural vegetation patches surrounded by different anthropogenic land cover (ALC) types of variable habitat quality. In many regions, ALC is the dominant form of human-modified habitat available, but its importance to wildlife remains poorly understood.We present the first Pantropical comparative analysis of the responses of all wild hoofed mammal populations (terrestrial ungulates: Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Proboscidea) to six major ALC types (exotic pastures, annual croplands, abandoned croplands, perennial croplands, tree plantations, and agroforestry).Specifically, we evaluate whether life-history trait, threat status, and structural landscape contrast can explain ungulate habitat use in these ALC types. We also investigate which land uses are most likely to contribute to the persistence of Tropical cervids, bovids, tapirs, suids, and tayassuids.We show that habitat breadth and body mass are key positive and negative life-history predictors of wild ungulate responses to ALC, respectively. Additionally, our results indicate that perennial and annual croplands are the most detrimental to wild ungulates, whereas agroforestry exerts a relatively benign effect. ALC is more detrimental to Neotropical ungulates than to their ecological analogues in the Palaeotropics.We emphasise the pervasive effects of large-scale mechanised cropland, and the often positive role of agroforestry systems as supplementary habitats in sustaining wild ungulate assemblages. Large tracts of natural habitat under varying degrees of connectivity can enhance the persistence of viable Tropical ungulate populations.
